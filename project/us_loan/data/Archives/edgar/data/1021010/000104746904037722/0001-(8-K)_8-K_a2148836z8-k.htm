<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2004, Edge Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Edge"), entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Johnson Rice&nbsp;&amp;
Company&nbsp;L.L.C. and Raymond James&nbsp;&amp; Associates,&nbsp;Inc. (together, the "Underwriters") for the public offering of 3,500,000&nbsp;shares of Edge's common stock (the "Offering"), with
an additional 525,000&nbsp;shares of Edge's common stock issuable pursuant to an over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters (collectively, the "Shares"). The Shares are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to Edge's shelf registration statement (Registration No.&nbsp;333-115692), as supplemented by the Prospectus
Supplement dated December&nbsp;16, 2004 relating to the Shares filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b) of the Securities Act. Closing of the Offering is
scheduled for December&nbsp;21, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;7, 2004, Edge filed a Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K setting forth, among other things, as </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> thereto, Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
relating to Edge's anticipated acquisition of certain working
and revenue interests in oil and natural gas properties in south Texas from Contango Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas Company (the "Acquisition"). Revised unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements are being filed herewith because certain of the amounts included in paragraphs (e)&nbsp;and (1)&nbsp;in the notes to such financial statements were affected by the increase in the
number of shares anticipated to be issued in the Offering from 3,000,000 to 3,500,000 shares. Edge expects to ultimately finance the purchase of such assets with proceeds from the Offering and does
not anticipate borrowing any amounts under its credit facility to fund the purchase price. Edge is presenting on a pro forma basis the incurrence of indebtedness under an expanded line of credit to
finance the entire purchase price, rather than presenting the effects of financing the purchase price with the proceeds of the Offering because Edge's obligation to purchase such assets for the cash
purchase price is not contingent upon a successful offering. However, paragraphs&nbsp;(e) and (1)&nbsp;in the notes to the financial statements set forth certain of the pro forma information
assuming the Acquisition is financed entirely with proceeds from the Offering and not with additional borrowings under Edge's credit facility. Accordingly, the amounts set forth in those paragraphs in
the prior filing were affected by the increase in the size of the offering (excluding any shares issuable pursuant to the over-allotment option) from 3,000,000 to 3,500,000 shares.
Attached as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto are revised Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of Edge Petroleum Corporation for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of Edge Petroleum Corporation as of
September&nbsp;30, 2004, and the related notes thereto, adjusted to show the pro forma effects of the Acquisition and the financing thereof. </FONT></P>

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED<BR>
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Background  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared to show the effect of the pending acquisition
of the working and net revenue interests of certain properties from Contango Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas Company ("Contango"). The properties are comprised primarily of interests in 38 onshore producing natural
gas and oil wells, located in Jim Hogg and Brooks counties, Texas. The properties to be acquired are hereinafter referred to as the "Contango Assets" and such acquisition is herein referred to as the
"Acquisition." Completion of the Acquisition is subject to, among other things, certain closing conditions, including obtaining certain consents from lessors and Contango's shareholder approval. We
priced an offering of 3,500,000&nbsp;shares of common stock on December&nbsp;16, 2004, which is expected to close on or about December&nbsp;21, 2004 (the "Offering"). The shares are to be
offered to the public at a price of $14.45 per share. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $47.5&nbsp;million from the Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and the estimated expenses of the offering. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 525,000&nbsp;shares at the public offering price less the
underwriting discount. We contemplate ultimately using substantially all of the net proceeds from the Offering to finance the Acquisition. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
October&nbsp;7, 2004, we executed an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire the Contango Assets for a cash price of approximately $50&nbsp;million. However, the purchase price is
subject to adjustment, among other things, for the results of operations of the Contango Assets between July&nbsp;1, 2004 and closing. As a result, we estimate that the purchase price, following the
initial adjustment at closing, will be approximately $43&nbsp;million, assuming the sale is completed on December&nbsp;31, 2004, and the final purchase price, following the
post-closing adjustment, will be approximately $40&nbsp;million. We have
assumed a purchase price of $40&nbsp;million for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to finance the purchase of the Contango Assets entirely with proceeds from the Offering and do not anticipate borrowing any amounts under our credit facility to fund the
purchase price. However, the lenders under our credit facility have conditionally agreed that our borrowing base will increase to approximately $65&nbsp;million upon consummation of our acquisition
of the Contango Assets. We are presenting on a pro forma basis the incurrence of indebtedness under an expanded line of credit to finance the entire purchase price, rather than presenting the effects
of financing the purchase price with the proceeds of the Offering, because our obligation to purchase the Contango Assets for the cash purchase price is not contingent upon a successful offering.
Accordingly, the pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements give effect to (i)&nbsp;an increase in borrowings under our line of credit to finance the Contango Asset Acquisition, and
(ii)&nbsp;our acquisition of the Contango Assets and the expenses related thereto. Paragraphs&nbsp;(e) and (1) in the notes to these financial statements sets forth certain of the pro forma
information assuming the Acquisition is financed entirely with proceeds from the Offering and not with additional borrowings under our credit facility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Sources of Information and Basis of Presentation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 are derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of Edge Petroleum Corporation ("Edge") for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, the audited statement of revenues and direct operating expenses for the Contango Assets for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and the adjustments and assumptions described below. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated </FONT></P>

of operations for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September&nbsp;30, 2004 are based on our unaudited
financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, the unaudited statement of revenues and direct operating expenses for the Contango Assets for the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004, and the adjustments and assumptions described below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto, our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, our Quarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 and the statements of revenues and direct operating expenses for
the Contango Assets included as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to our Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K filed December&nbsp;7, 2004. Pro forma data are
based on assumptions and include adjustments as explained in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain information (including substantial footnote
disclosures) included in the annual and quarterly historical financial statements has been excluded in these condensed pro forma financial statements. The pro forma data presented is not necessarily
indicative of the financial results that would have been attained had the Acquisition
occurred on the date referenced above, and should not be viewed as indicative of operations in future periods. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>How the Pro Forma Financial Statements Were Prepared  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and for the nine-month period ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004 were each prepared without audit assuming we acquired the Contango Assets on January&nbsp;1, 2003. Certain reclassifications of the historical amounts reported by Contango
were made to facilitate combining their results with ours. Our fiscal year end is December&nbsp;31, whereas Contango's fiscal year end is June&nbsp;30, therefore certain adjustments were necessary
to present the revenues and direct operating expenses of the Contango Assets on a comparable basis to Edge. In order to shift the fiscal periods of the Contango Assets, Contango's calendar year
quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, June&nbsp;30, 2004 and September&nbsp;30, 2004 were added together to present the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Contango Assets were not accounted for or operated as a separate division by Contango. Certain costs, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&amp;A"), accretion expense,
general and administrative expenses, and corporate income taxes were not allocated to the individual properties comprising the Contango Assets. Also, Contango has historically utilized the successful
efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities, while we use the full cost method. Under the successful-efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical ("G&amp;G"), exploratory dry holes
and delay rentals are expensed as incurred whereas under the full-cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full-cost pool. Accordingly,
exploration expenses, which are recorded under the successful efforts method, are not applicable to our presentation. Full separate financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States do not exist for the Contango Assets and are not practicable to obtain in these circumstances. Therefore, on a historical basis, we are presenting
only the revenues and direct operating expenses for the Contango Assets. This presentation excludes all other historical expenses and therefore no operating income or net income is presented for the
Contango Assets on a historical basis. Certain estimates and judgments were made in preparing the pro forma adjustments as discussed in the notes, including as to the incremental expenses associated
with the Contango Assets. With these adjustments, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations represent only an estimate of combining our historical results and those of
the Contango Assets. The statements do not consider nonrecurring items included in the historical financial statements, such as the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet was prepared without audit assuming we acquired the Contango Assets on September&nbsp;30, 2004. Assuming a December&nbsp;31, 2004
closing date, we expect that the final adjusted purchase price will be reduced from the original $50&nbsp;million to approximately $40&nbsp;million, plus other direct transaction costs of
$175,000. This preliminary estimate of the total cost of the Acquisition is allocated to property, with approximately $5&nbsp;million allocated to unevaluated property. We will also record amounts
for asset retirement obligations related to plugging and abandoning these properties. For the purposes of this pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet, we are presenting the Acquisition on a
pro forma basis assuming we incur indebtedness under our credit facility to finance the entire purchase price. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet is based on management's preliminary estimates of acquired fair values and the related costs of the transaction. The
purchase price is subject to purchase price adjustments, including for the results of operations of the Contango Assets between July&nbsp;1, 2004 and closing. As a result, when the Acquisition is
completed, the purchase price may be different than this preliminary estimate. The transaction costs could also differ from the preliminary estimates used here. For these reasons, the actual purchase
price and purchase price allocation will differ from the amounts presented herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to present what our financial position or results of operations would have been
had we acquired the Contango Assets on the dates indicated. They also cannot be relied upon as a projection of future results. The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in
conjunction with our historical financial statements, which we have previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </FONT></P>

incremental depreciation, depletion and amortization expense ("DD&amp;A") using the units-of-production method, resulting from the purchase of the Contango
Assets. Also record incremental accretion expense resulting from the liability we will record for asset retirement obligations ("ARO") in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

incremental general and administrative costs related to this acquisition have been included as general and administrative costs and are not expected to increase above current
levels. The Contango Assets are operated by a single operator. As a result, a very minimal amount of our internal resources will be used to oversee the Contango Assets and accordingly we believe that
the impact from the Acquisition on our total general and administrative expenses will be minimal.

interest expense on and the related expenses of increased borrowings, assuming an additional $40&nbsp;million is borrowed under our credit facility to finance the Acquisition.
Since Edge's obligation to purchase the Contango Assets for the specified cash purchase price is not contingent upon a successful offering, we have presented the incurrence of additional indebtedness
under an expanded line of credit and, therefore we are reflecting the interest expense we would have incurred in these periods had the Acquisition been funded by additional borrowings under our line
of credit. The interest rate applied to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 is 4.02% and the interest rate applied to the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 is 4.17% on an initial
$40&nbsp;million as reduced quarterly by increased cash flows, less amounts capitalized on the unevaluated property allocation.

effect to the anticipated issuance of shares in the Offering would have a substantial dilutive effect on pro forma earnings per share for the periods presented. Assuming the
Offering is successful, we would utilize the proceeds thereof to entirely finance the Acquisition instead of borrowings on our expanded line of credit. Therefore basic and diluted weighted average
shares outstanding would increase by 3,500,000&nbsp;shares of common stock. This would change the earnings per share data for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004 as set forth below. This does not reflect the additional dilutive </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects the following adjustments: </FONT></P>

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Record
borrowings on an expanded line of credit to finance the anticipated final adjusted purchase price for the Contango Assets of $40&nbsp;million assuming the acquisition closes
on December&nbsp;31, 2004. This amount represents the original $50&nbsp;million purchase price less certain closing adjustments, including for the estimated results of operations between
July&nbsp;1, 2004 and closing. The lenders under our credit facility have conditionally agreed that our borrowing base will increase to $65&nbsp;million upon consummation of the Acquisition. We
expect to finance the Acquisition entirely with proceeds from the Offering to avoid borrowings on our line of credit, but should the timing of these transactions change or the Offering not be
completed, we will utilize borrowings. If the Offering were reflected in the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet, the $40&nbsp;million of debt would be replaced by an increase in equity
of $47.5&nbsp;million, with the excess above the purchase price of the Acquisition reflected in an increase to cash (assuming the issuance of 3,500,000&nbsp;shares of common stock at a price to
the public of $14.45 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses. The actual number of shares could differ from this estimate if the over-allotment option is
exercised).
