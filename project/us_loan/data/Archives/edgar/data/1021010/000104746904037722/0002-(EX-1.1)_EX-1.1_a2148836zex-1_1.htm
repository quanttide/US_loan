set forth,

forth opposite the name of each such Underwriter under the caption "Number of Firm Shares to be Purchased" in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto. In addition, the
Company grants to each Underwriter an option to purchase, severally and not jointly, the number of Option Shares, at the same price per share, specified in the notice by Johnson Rice described below.
Such option is hereby granted for the purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of Firm Shares, and will expire if not exercised within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days after the
date of this Agreement. The option granted hereby may be exercised in whole or in part (but not more than once) by Johnson Rice, only for the purpose of covering over-allotments that may
be made in connection with the offering and distribution of the Firm Shares. The notice of exercise shall set forth the number of Option Shares as to which each Underwriter is exercising the option,
and the time and date of payment therefor and of issuance and delivery thereof. Such time and date of payment, issuance and delivery (the "Second Delivery Date") shall be determined by Johnson Rice
but shall not be earlier than two full business days after the exercise of such option, nor in any event prior to the First Delivery Date (as defined in Section&nbsp;2(b)). In the event Johnson Rice
exercises the option granted hereby for the full number of Option Shares, the Company shall sell to each Underwriter the number of Option Shares set forth opposite the names of each such Underwriter
under the caption "Number of Option Shares Purchasable" in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto. In the event that Johnson Rice exercises such option for less than

may be, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Firm Shares or the Option Shares, as the case may be, through the facilities of the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to the Underwriters,
for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, against payment of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account(s) as the Company may designate

contribution could be sought under this Section&nbsp;6 or Section&nbsp;7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise
or consent (i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii)&nbsp;does not include
a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for settlement, compromise or consent to

such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause&nbsp;(i) is not

equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement
shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set

alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative

Subsidiary, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. </FONT></P>

such qualifications as may be set forth in the Prospectus, except for such licenses, certificates, authorizations or permits the failure of which to maintain would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit which, singly or in
the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect. To the best of such counsel's knowledge, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in

Material Adverse Effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned understands that Edge Petroleum Corporation,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
(i)&nbsp;a Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-3 (Registration No.&nbsp;333-115692) relating to the registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, of securities of the Company, including shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and (ii)&nbsp;a prospectus dated December&nbsp;8, 2004 to be supplemented by the Company's final prospectus supplement relating to the offering (the
"Offering") of 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Shares"). The registration statement at the time it became effective, or if a post-effective amendment has been filed with respect
thereto as amended by such post-effective amendment at the time of its effectiveness (including in each case the information (if any) deemed to be part of the registration statement at the
time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule&nbsp;430A under the 1933 Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement;"
the prospectus as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Shares in the form first used to confirm sales of Shares is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus." </FONT></P>

order to induce Johnson Rice&nbsp;&amp; Company L.L.C. ("Johnson Rice") and Raymond James&nbsp;&amp; Associates,&nbsp;Inc. (together with Johnson Rice, the "Underwriters"), to enter in
to a certain underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with the Company, with respect to the Offering, the undersigned hereby agrees that for a period of 90&nbsp;days following the date
of the Prospectus (the "Restricted Period"), the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Johnson Rice, (i)&nbsp;directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell
any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of any share of Common Stock or any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, or (ii)&nbsp;enter into any swap or any other agreement or transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause&nbsp;(i) or (ii)&nbsp;above is to be settled by delivery of Common
Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (A)&nbsp;transfers of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock as a gift of
gifts or as intra-family transfers or transfers to trusts or family limited partnerships for estate planning purposes, (B)&nbsp;transfers of Common Stock or any security convertible into Common
Stock by will or intestacy; (C)&nbsp;bona fide pledges of Common Stock existing on the date of this letter or (D)&nbsp;subsequent pledges of Common Stock if the pledgee of such Common Stock agrees
in writing to be bound by the restrictions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i)&nbsp;during the last seventeen (17)&nbsp;days of the Restricted Period the Company issues an earnings
release or (ii)&nbsp;prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of
the Restricted Period, the restrictions set forth herein shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the </FONT></P>
