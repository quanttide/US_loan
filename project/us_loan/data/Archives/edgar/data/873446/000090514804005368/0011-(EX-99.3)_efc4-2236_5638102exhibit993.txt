      take all appropriate action that it is the duty of the Issuer or the
      Owner Trustee to take pursuant to the Related Agreements. In furtherance
      thereof, the Owner Trustee shall, on behalf of itself and of the Issuer,
      execute and deliver to the Administrator and to each successor
      Administrator appointed pursuant to the terms hereof, one or more powers
      of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, appointing
      the Administrator the attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee and the
      Issuer for the purpose of executing on behalf of the Owner Trustee and

      withholding tax is imposed on the Issuer's payments (or allocations of
      income) to the Beneficiary or any other holder of a Seller's Certificate
      as contemplated in Section 4.01(b) of the Trust Agreement. Any such
      notice shall specify the amount of any withholding tax required to be

      performed by the Administrator under the Trust Agreement.

                  (iii) In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its
      other obligations under this Agreement, the Administrator may enter into
      transactions or otherwise deal with any of its affiliates; provided,
      however, that the terms of any such transactions or dealings shall be in
      accordance with any directions received from the Issuer and shall be, in
      the Administrator's opinion, no less favorable to the Issuer than would
      be available from unaffiliated parties.

            (c) Non-Ministerial Matters.

                  (i) With respect to matters that in the reasonable judgment
      of the Administrator are non-ministerial, the Administrator shall not

      the proposed action and the Owner Trustee shall not have withheld
      consent or provided an alternative direction. For the purpose of the

      action that the Issuer directs the Administrator not to take on its
      behalf.

      2. Records. The Administrator shall maintain appropriate books of

shall furnish to the Issuer from time to time such additional information

the Administrator shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject
to the supervision of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee with respect to the
manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder.
Unless expressly authorized by the Issuer, the Administrator shall have no
authority to act for or represent the Issuer or the Owner Trustee in any way
and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee.

constitute the Administrator and either of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee as
members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate,
unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to
impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer

      11. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended from time to time by a
written amendment duly executed and delivered by the Issuer, the Administrator
and the Indenture Trustee, with the written consent of the Owner Trustee, but
without the consent of the Noteholders or the holders of the Seller's
Certificates, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any
manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying
in any manner the rights of the Noteholders or the holders of the Seller's
Certificates; provided that such amendment will not, in an Opinion of Counsel
delivered to the Indenture Trustee, materially and adversely affect the
interest of any Noteholder or holder of a Seller's Certificate. This Agreement
may also be amended by the Issuer, the Administrator and the Indenture Trustee
with the written consent of the Owner Trustee, the holders of Notes evidencing
at least a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes
affected by such amendment and the holders of Seller's Certificates evidencing
at least a majority of the Percentage Interests (as defined in the Trust
Agreement) of the outstanding Seller's Certificates affected by such
amendment, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any
manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying
in any manner the rights of Noteholders or holders of the Seller's
Certificates; provided, however, that no such amendment may (i) increase or
reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of,
collections of payments on Receivables or distributions that are required to
be made for the benefit of the Noteholders or the holders of the Seller's
Certificates or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the holders of Notes
or Seller's Certificates which are required to consent to any such amendment,
without the consent of the holders of all the outstanding Notes or Seller's
Certificates, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the immediately preceding sentence, any amendment to be effected pursuant to
such sentence without the consent of each adversely affected Noteholder shall
be subject to the Indenture Trustee's receipt of written confirmation from
each applicable Note Rating Agency that such amendment will not have a Ratings
Effect with respect to the adversely affected Notes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrator may not amend this Agreement without the written
consent of the Beneficiary, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      12. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by the
Administrator unless such assignment is previously consented to in writing by
the Issuer and the Owner Trustee and subject to receipt of a confirmation from
each Note Rating Agency that such assignment will not cause a reduction,
qualification or withdrawal of any then current rating of any Notes. An
assignment with such consent and confirmation, if accepted by the assignee,
shall bind the assignee hereunder in the same manner as the Administrator is
bound hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be assigned
by the Administrator without the consent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to
a corporation or other organization that is a successor (by merger,
consolidation or purchase of assets) to the Administrator; provided that such
successor organization executes and delivers to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee an agreement in which such corporation or other
organization agrees to be bound hereunder by the terms of said assignment in
the same manner as the Administrator is bound hereunder. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall bind any successors or assigns of the parties
hereto.

      13. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT



                                      11
<PAGE>

REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE
NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

      14. Headings. The section headings hereof have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be construed to affect the
meaning, construction or effect of this Agreement.

      15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which when so executed shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

      16. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

      17. Not Applicable to DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC in
Other Capacities. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any obligation
DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC may have in any other capacity.

      18. Limitation of Liability of Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee.

            (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
this instrument has been countersigned by Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National
Association not in its individual capacity but solely in its capacity as Owner

Association in its individual capacity or, except as expressly provided in the
Trust Agreement, any beneficial owner of the Issuer have any liability for the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations of the
Issuer hereunder, as to all of which recourse shall be had solely to the
assets of the Issuer. For all purposes of this Agreement, in the performance
of any duties or obligations of the Issuer hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall
be subject to, and entitled to the benefits of, the terms and provisions of
Articles V, VI and XI of the Trust Agreement.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
this Agreement has been countersigned by Indenture Trustee not in its
individual capacity but solely as Indenture Trustee and in no event shall
Indenture Trustee have any liability for the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations of the Issuer hereunder or in any
of the certificates, notices or agreements delivered pursuant hereto, as to
all of which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the Issuer.

      19. Third-Party Beneficiary. The Owner Trustee is a third-party
beneficiary to this Agreement and is entitled to the rights and benefits
hereunder and may enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto.



                                      12

      20. No Petition. The Administrator hereby covenants and agrees that it
will not at any time institute against the Issuer or DCWR any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other
proceedings under any United States Federal or state bankruptcy or similar
law.
