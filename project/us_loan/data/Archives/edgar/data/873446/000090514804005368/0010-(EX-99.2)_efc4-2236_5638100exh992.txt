<PAGE>


Security with respect thereto owned by the Seller at the close of business on
such Transfer Date and not theretofore conveyed to the Trust, all monies due
or to become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all
proceeds (including Recoveries) thereof. Such property, together with the

          (c) The foregoing sale, transfer, assignment, set-over and
conveyance and any subsequent sales, transfers, assignments, set-overs and
conveyances do not constitute, and are not intended to result in, the creation
or an assumption by the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee, any Agent, any
Noteholder or any Enhancement Provider of any obligation of the Servicer, DCS,
the Seller, DaimlerChrysler or any other Person in connection with the
Accounts, the Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating

"accounts" or "payment intangibles" (each as defined in Section 9-102 of the
UCC as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction) meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect the sale and assignment of the Receivables and the Collateral
Security to the Trust, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing
statements or other evidence of such filing to the Trustee on or prior to the
Effective Date, in the case of the Existing Accounts, and (if any additional
filing is so necessary) the applicable Addition Date, in the case of
Additional Accounts. The Trustee shall be under no obligation whatsoever to
file such financing statement, or a continuation statement to such financing
statement, or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection with such
sales.

          (e) In connection with such sales, the Seller further agrees, at its
own expense, on or prior to the Effective Date, in the case of the Existing
Accounts, the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Additional Accounts,
and the applicable Removal Commencement Date, in the case of Removed Accounts,
(x) to indicate in its computer files and to cause DCS to indicate in its
computer files as required by the Receivables Purchase Agreement, that the
Receivables created in connection with the Accounts (other than Removed
Accounts) have been sold, and the Collateral Security assigned, to the Seller
in accordance with the Receivables Purchase Agreement, and sold to the Trust
pursuant to this Agreement, and pledged by the Trust to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the
Indenture and (y) to deliver to the Trust and the Trustee (or cause DCS to do
so) a computer file or microfiche or written list containing a true and
complete list of all such Accounts (other than Removed Accounts) specifying
for each such Account, as of the Initial Cut-Off Date, in the case of the
Existing Accounts, and the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, in the case of
Additional Accounts, (i) its account number, (ii) the aggregate amount of
Receivables outstanding in such Account and (iii) the aggregate amount of
Principal Receivables in such Account. Such file, microfiche or list, as

          (f) The parties hereto intend that the transfers of Purchased Assets
effected by this Agreement be sales. Nevertheless, if such transfers are
deemed to be transfers for security, then this Agreement also shall be deemed
to be and hereby is a security agreement within the meaning of the UCC, and
the conveyance by the Seller provided for in this Agreement shall also be
deemed to be and hereby is a grant by the Seller to the Trust of a security
interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest, whether now owned
or hereafter acquired, in, to and under such Purchased Assets. For tax
purposes, the parties hereto intend that all transfers of Purchased Assets
under this Agreement constitute transfers of such Purchased Assets as security
for a loan.

hereafter created, conveyed to the Trust pursuant to Section 2.01 and declares
that it shall hold such right, title and interest subject to the rights of the
Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties as provided herein

simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Seller
delivered to the Trust and the Trustee the computer file or microfiche or
written list relating to the Existing Accounts described in Section 2.01(e).

by the CARCO Trust Trustee on behalf of the Seller as provided in the Program
Amendment Agreement) to the Trust on the Effective Date pursuant to Section
2.01(a), the Trust (i) shall cause the Indenture Trustee to deliver, on behalf
of the Trust and the Seller, on the Effective Date the Collateral Certificate
to the CARCO Trust Trustee for cancellation by the CARCO Trust Trustee and
(ii) shall execute, and cause the Owner Trustee to authenticate and deliver to
the order of the Seller on the Effective Date, the DCMOT Certificate pursuant
to the Trust Agreement; it being understood that concurrently with such
issuance and delivery of the DCMOT Certificate to the Seller, the Seller shall
have delivered the CARCO Certificate to the CARCO Trust Trustee for
cancellation by the CARCO Trust Trustee.

          (c) In consideration for the property transferred by the Seller to
the Trust on each Addition Date pursuant to Section 2.01(a) and on each
Transfer Date (other than the Effective Date) pursuant to Section 2.01(b), the
Trust shall cause to be paid to the Seller all such funds available to be paid
to the Seller in respect of the Seller's Interest, to the extent specifically
permitted under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements;
it being understood that any excess of the aggregate principal balance of the
Receivables transferred on an Addition Date or a Transfer Date (other than the
Effective Date) over the funds available to be paid to the Seller on such date
shall result, to the extent provided in this Agreement, the Indenture and the
Indenture Supplements, in an increase of the Seller's Interest evidenced by
the Seller's Certificates issued pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (ii) seeking to prevent the

          (h) Enforceability. This Agreement and the Related Documents each

          (i) Record of Accounts. As of the Effective Date, in the case of the
Existing Accounts, as of the applicable Addition Date, in the case of the

material adverse effect on the Noteholders' Interest caused thereby shall have
been cured. The Seller shall deposit in the Collection Account in immediately
available funds on the Business Day preceding such Payment Date, in payment
for such purchase of the Noteholders' Interest, the Reassignment Amount for
such Payment Date.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such
amounts deposited in the Collection Account shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture and shall be allocated pro rata among the
then-outstanding Series based on their respective Series Nominal Liquidation
Amounts. If the Trustee or the Noteholders give notice directing the Seller to
purchase the Noteholders' Interest as provided above, the obligation of the
Seller to purchase the Noteholders' Interest pursuant to this Section 2.03
shall constitute the sole remedy respecting an event of the type specified in
the first sentence of this Section 2.03 available to the Noteholders (or the
Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders).

     SECTION 2.04 Representations and Warranties of the Seller Relating to the
Receivables.

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Trust that:

              (i) Each Receivable and all Collateral Security existing on the
     Effective Date or, in the case of Additional Accounts, on the applicable
     Addition Date, and on each Transfer Date, has been conveyed to the Trust
     free and clear of any Lien, subject to the rights of the Purchased
     Receivables Owners in any Collateral Security in respect of the Partial
     Accounts (other than the Vehicles relating to Principal Receivables
     arising in the Partial Accounts) and except for Liens permitted under the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement.

              (ii) With respect to each Receivable and all Collateral Security
     existing on the Effective Date or, in the case of Additional Accounts, on
     the applicable Addition Date, and on each Transfer Date, all consents,
     licenses, approvals or authorizations of or registrations or declarations
     with any Governmental Authority required to be obtained, effected or
     given by the Seller in connection with the conveyance of such Receivable
     or Collateral Security to the Trust have been duly obtained, effected or
     given and are in full force and effect.


                                      25


<PAGE>


              (iii) On the Initial Cut-Off Date, the Effective Date and each
     subsequent Closing Date, each Existing Account is an Eligible Account
     and, in the case of Additional Accounts, on the applicable Additional
     Cut-Off Date and each subsequent Closing Date, each such Additional
     Account is an Eligible Account.

              (iv) On the Effective Date, in the case of the Existing Accounts,
     and, in the case of the Additional Accounts, on the applicable Additional
     Cut-Off Date, and on each Transfer Date, each Receivable conveyed to the
     Trust on such date is an Eligible Receivable or, if such Receivable is
     not an Eligible Receivable, such Receivable is conveyed to the Trust in
     accordance with Section 2.09.

          (b) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 2.04 shall survive the transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Trust and the issuance of the Notes. Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Servicer, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Agent or the Trustee
of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 2.04, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written
notice to the other parties specified above, and to any Enhancement Providers.

          (c) Reassignment. In the event any representation or warranty under
Section 2.04(a) is not true and correct as of the date specified therein with
respect to any Receivable or Account and such breach has a material adverse
effect on the Noteholders' Interest in any such Receivable or Account, then,
within 30 days (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee) of
the earlier to occur of the discovery of any such event by the Seller or the
Servicer, or receipt by the Seller or the Servicer of written notice of any
such event given by the Trustee, any Agent or any Enhancement Providers, the
Seller shall accept a reassignment of such Receivable or, in the case of such
an untrue representation or warranty with respect to an Account, all
Receivables in such Account, on the Determination Date immediately succeeding
the day of such discovery or notice on the terms and conditions set forth in
the next succeeding paragraph; provided, however, that no such reassignment
shall be required to be made with respect to such Receivable if, by the end of
such 30-day period (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee),
the breached representation or warranty shall then be true and correct in all
material respects and any material adverse effect caused thereby shall have
been cured.

          The Seller shall accept a reassignment of each such Receivable by
directing the Servicer to deduct, subject to the next sentence, the principal
amount of such Receivables from the Pool Balance on or prior to the end of the
Collection Period in which such reassignment obligation arises. If, following
such deduction, the Pool Balance would be less than the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount on the immediately preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
deposits to be made on the Payment Date following such Determination Date),
then not later than 12:00 noon on the day on which such reassignment occurs,
the Seller shall deposit in the Collection Account in immediately available
funds the amount (the "Transfer Deposit Amount") by which the Pool Balance
would be less than the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount (up to the
principal amount of such Receivables); provided that if the Transfer Deposit
Amount is not deposited as required by this sentence, then the principal
amounts of such Receivables shall only be deducted from the Pool Balance to
the extent that the Pool Balance is not reduced below the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount, and the Receivables the principal amounts of


                                      26


<PAGE>


which have not been so deducted shall not be reassigned to the Seller and
shall remain part of the Trust. Upon reassignment of any such Receivable, but
only after payment by the Seller of the Transfer Deposit Amount, if any, the
Trust shall automatically and without further action be deemed to sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without
recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the
Trust in and to such Receivable, all Collateral Security and all moneys due or
to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof. The Trustee shall
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall reasonably be requested by the Seller to effect the
conveyance of such Receivables pursuant to this Section. The obligation of the
Seller to accept a reassignment of any such Receivable and to pay any related
Transfer Deposit Amount shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event
giving rise to such obligation available to the Trust, the Noteholders (or the
Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders).

     SECTION 2.05 Addition of Accounts.

          (a) If, as of the close of business on the last day of any
Collection Period, (i) the Pool Balance on such day is less than the Required
Participation Amount as of the following Payment Date (after giving effect to
the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on such
Payment Date), or (ii) the result obtained by multiplying (x) the Seller's
Participation Amount as of the following Payment Date (after giving effect to
the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on such
Payment Date), by (y) the percentage equivalent of the portion of the Seller's
Interest represented by the DCMOT Certificate, is less than 2% of the Pool
Balance on such last day, then the Seller shall, within ten Business Days
following the end of such Collection Period, designate and transfer to the
Trust the Receivables (and the related Collateral Security) of additional
Eligible Accounts of the Seller to be included as Accounts in a sufficient
amount such that after giving effect to such addition (i) the Pool Balance as
of the close of business on the Addition Date is at least equal to such
Required Participation Amount or (ii) the result obtained by multiplying (x)
such Seller's Participation Amount by (y) the percentage equivalent of the
portion of the Seller's Interest represented by the DCMOT Certificate, is at
least equal to 2% of such Pool Balance, as the case may be. The Seller shall
satisfy the conditions specified in Section 2.05(d) in designating such
Additional Accounts and conveying the related Receivables to the Trust. The
failure of the Seller to transfer Receivables to the Trust as provided in this
paragraph solely as a result of the unavailability of a sufficient amount of
Eligible Receivables shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement;
provided, however, that any such failure will nevertheless result in the
occurrence of an Early Redemption Event described in each Indenture
Supplement, unless otherwise specified therein with respect to the related
Series or Class.

          (b) The Seller may from time to time, at its sole discretion,
subject to the conditions specified in paragraph (d) below, voluntarily
designate additional Eligible Accounts (including Partial Accounts) to be
included as Accounts and transfer to the Trust the Receivables (and the
related Collateral Security) of such Additional Accounts.

          (c) Receivables and Collateral Security from such Additional
Accounts shall be sold to the Trust effective on a date (the "Addition Date")
specified in a written notice provided by the Seller (or the Servicer on its
behalf) to the Trust, the Trustee, the Rating Agencies, any Agent and any
Enhancement Providers specifying the Additional Cut-Off Date


                                      27


<PAGE>


and the Addition Date for such Additional Accounts (the "Addition Notice") on
or before the fifth Business Day but not more than the 30th day prior to the
related Addition Date (the "Notice Date"). The Addition Notice shall also
specify whether any such Additional Accounts are Partial Accounts.

          (d) The Seller shall be permitted to convey to the Trust the
Receivables and all Collateral Security related thereto in any Additional
Accounts designated by the Seller as such pursuant to Section 2.05(a) or (b)
only upon satisfaction of each of the following conditions on or prior to the
related Addition Date:

               (i) the Seller shall have provided the Trust, the Trustee, any
     Agent, the Rating Agencies and any Enhancement Providers with a timely
     Addition Notice;

               (ii) such Additional Accounts shall all be Eligible Accounts;

               (iii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust and the
     Trustee a duly executed written assignment (which shall be acknowledged
     and accepted by the Trustee) in substantially the form of Exhibit B (the
     "Assignment") and the computer file or microfiche or written list
     required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.01;

               (iv) the Seller shall, to the extent required by Section 4.03,
     have deposited in the Collection Account all Collections with respect to
     such Additional Accounts since the Additional Cut-Off Date;

               (v) (A) no selection procedures believed by the Seller to be
     adverse to the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or any Enhancement
     Providers were used in selecting such Additional Accounts; (B) the list
     of Additional Accounts delivered pursuant to clause (iii) above is true
     and correct in all material respects as of the Additional Cut-Off Date
     and (C) as of each of the Notice Date and the Addition Date, the Seller
     was neither insolvent nor will be made insolvent by such transfer, and
     the Seller is not aware of any pending insolvency;

               (vi) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with
     respect to such addition;

               (vii) the addition of the Receivables arising in such Additional
     Accounts shall not result in the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event;

               (viii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the
     Trustee and any Enhancement Providers a certificate of a Vice President
     or more senior officer confirming (A) the items set forth in paragraphs
     (ii) through (vii) above and (B) that the Seller reasonably believes that
     the addition of the Receivables arising in such Additional Accounts will
     not result in the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event; and

               (ix) on or before each Addition Date, the Seller shall have
     delivered to the Trust, the Trustee and any Enhancement Providers (A) an
     Opinion of Counsel with respect to the Receivables in the Additional
     Accounts substantially in the form of Exhibit


                                      28


<PAGE>


     G-2 and (B) except in the case of an addition required by Section
     2.05(a), a Tax Opinion with respect to such addition.


          (e) The Seller hereby represents and warrants as of the applicable
Addition Date as to the matters set forth in Section 2.05(d)(v). Upon
discovery by the Seller, the Servicer, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Agent
or the Trustee of a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties,
the party discovering the breach shall give prompt written notice to the other
parties specified above, and to any Enhancement Providers.

          (f) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Rating Agencies,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller may
from time to time, at its discretion, and subject only to the limitations
specified in this paragraph, designate Additional Accounts to be added to the
Trust. (Additional Accounts designated to be added to the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 2.05(f) are referred to herein as
"Automatic Additional Accounts".) On the Addition Date with respect to any
Automatic Additional Accounts, the Trust shall purchase the Receivables in
such Automatic Additional Accounts (and such Automatic Additional Accounts
shall be deemed to be Accounts for purposes of this Agreement) as of the close
of business on the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (i) such Automatic Additional Accounts shall be Eligible
     Accounts;

               (ii) the Seller shall, to the extent required by Section 4.03,
     have deposited in the Collection Account all Collections with respect to
     such Automatic Additional Accounts since the Additional Cut-Off Date;

               (iii) no selection procedures believed by the Seller to be
     adverse to the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or any Enhancement
     Providers were used in selecting such Automatic Additional Accounts;

               (iv) as of each of the Additional Cut-Off Date and the Addition
     Date, no Insolvency Event with respect to DCS or the Seller shall have
     occurred nor shall the transfer of the Receivables arising in the
     Automatic Additional Accounts to the Trust have been made in
     contemplation of the occurrence thereof;

               (v) the addition of the Receivables arising in the Automatic
     Additional Accounts shall not cause an Early Redemption Event or any
     event that, after the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would
     constitute an Early Redemption Event to occur with respect to any Series;

               (vi) on or before each Addition Date with respect to Automatic
     Additional Accounts, the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the
     Trustee and the Rating Agencies (A) an Opinion of Counsel with respect to
     the Receivables in the Automatic Additional Accounts substantially in the
     form of Exhibit G-2 to this Agreement and (B) a Tax Opinion with respect
     to such addition;

               (vii) within ten Business Days of the date on which any such
     Receivables are added to the Trust, the Seller shall have delivered to
     the Trust and the


                                      29


<PAGE>


     Trustee a written assignment and a computer file or a microfiche list
     containing a true and complete list of the related Automatic Additional
     Accounts specifying for each such Account its account number, the
     collection status, the aggregate amount outstanding in such Account and
     the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables outstanding in such
     Account; and

               (viii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust and the
     Trustee an Officers' Certificate of the Seller, dated the Addition Date,
     to the effect that conditions (i) through (v) and (vii) above have been
     satisfied.

          The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Trust as of the
related Addition Date as to the matters relating to it set forth in paragraphs
(iii) and (iv) above and that the file or list described below is, as of the
applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, true and complete in all material
respects.

          In connection with the designation of Automatic Additional Accounts
to be added to the Trust, the Seller shall deliver to the Trust and the
Trustee (i) the computer file or microfiche list required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such Automatic Additional Accounts
and (ii) a duly executed written Assignment (which shall be acknowledged and
accepted by the Trustee), substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this
Agreement.

          Unless each Rating Agency otherwise consents, the number of
Automatic Additional Accounts added to the Trust with respect to any of the
three consecutive Collection Periods beginning in January, April, July and
October of each calendar year shall not exceed 8% of the number of Accounts as
of the first day of the calendar year during which such Collection Periods
commence and the number of Automatic Additional Accounts designated during any
such calendar year shall not exceed 20% of the number of Accounts as of the
first day of such calendar year. On or before the first business day of each
Collection Period beginning in January, April, July and October of each
calendar year, the Seller shall have requested and obtained notification from
each Rating Agency of any limitations to the right of the Seller to designate
Eligible Accounts as Automatic Additional Accounts during any period which
includes such Collection Period. To the extent that Automatic Additional
Accounts have been added to the Trust during the three consecutive Collection
Periods ending in the calendar month prior to such date, on or before January
31, April 30, July 31, October 31 of each calendar year, the Trustee shall
have received confirmation from each Rating Agency that the addition of all
Automatic Additional Accounts included as Accounts during the three
consecutive Collection Periods ending in the calendar month prior to such date
shall not have resulted in any applicable Rating Agency reducing or
withdrawing its rating of any outstanding Series or Class of Notes. If such
Rating Agency confirmation with respect to any Automatic Additional Accounts
is not so received, such Automatic Additional Accounts will be removed from
the Trust.

     SECTION 2.06 Covenants of the Seller.

          The Seller hereby covenants that:

          (a) No Liens. Except for the conveyances hereunder, or as provided
in Section 10.10 of the Trust Agreement with respect to Supplemental
Certificates, the Seller will


                                      30


<PAGE>


not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant, create,
incur, assume or (subject to the rights of the Purchased Receivables Owners
with respect to the Collateral Security arising in the Partial Accounts (other
than the Vehicles relating to any Principal Receivables) and except as
permitted under the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents) suffer to exist any Lien on, any Receivable or any Collateral
Security, whether now existing or hereafter created, or any interest therein,
or the Seller's rights, remedies, powers or privileges with respect to the
Receivables under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, or the Seller's Interest
or the Seller's Certificates and the Seller shall defend the right, title and
interest of the Trust in, to and under the Receivables and the Collateral
Security, whether now existing or hereafter created, and such rights,
remedies, powers and privileges, against all claims of third parties claiming
through or under the Seller.

          (b) Account Allocations. In the event that the Seller is unable for
any reason to transfer Receivables to the Trust, then the Seller agrees that
it shall allocate, after the occurrence of such event, payments on each
Account with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the
oldest principal balance of such Account and to have such payments applied as
Collections in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that, in the case of Partial Accounts, Collections of Principal Receivables
shall be allocated to the Principal Receivables to which such Collections
relate. The parties hereto agree that Non-Principal Receivables, whenever
created, accrued in respect of Principal Receivables which have been conveyed
to the Trust shall continue to be a part of the Trust notwithstanding any
cessation of the transfer of additional Principal Receivables to the Trust and
Collections with respect thereto shall continue to be allocated and paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (c) Delivery of Collections. In the event that the Seller, DCS or
any Affiliate thereof receives payments in respect of Receivables, the Seller
and DCS agree to pay or cause to be paid to the Servicer or any Successor
Servicer all payments received thereby in respect of the Receivables as soon
as practicable after receipt thereof, but in no event later than two Business
Days after the receipt by the Seller, DCS or any Affiliate thereof.

          (d) Notice of Liens. The Seller shall notify the Trust and the
Trustee promptly after becoming aware of any Lien on any Receivable other than
the conveyances hereunder.

          (e) Compliance with Law. The Seller hereby agrees to comply in all
material respects with all Requirements of Law applicable to the Seller.

          (f) Activities of the Seller. The Seller will not engage in any
business or activity of any kind or enter into any transaction other than (x)
the businesses, activities and transactions contemplated and authorized by
this Agreement or the Related Documents or (y) the business of acquiring,
selling or financing wholesale and retail receivables and related activities
and transactions (such businesses, activities and transactions, collectively,
"Permitted Transactions").

          (g) Indebtedness. The Seller will not create, incur or assume any
indebtedness or issue any securities or sell or transfer any receivables to a
trust or other Person


                                      31


<PAGE>


which issues securities in respect of any such receivables, unless (i) any
such indebtedness or securities have no recourse to any assets of the Seller
other than the specified assets to which such indebtedness or securities
relate and (ii) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied in
connection therewith prior to the incurrence or issuance thereof.

          (h) Guarantees. The Seller will not become or remain liable,
directly or contingently, in connection with any indebtedness or other
liability of any other Person, whether by guarantee, endorsement (other than
endorsements of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection in the
ordinary course of business), agreement to purchase or purchase, agreement to
supply or advance funds, or otherwise, except in connection with Permitted
Transactions and unless the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied
with respect thereto.

          (i) Investments. The Seller will not make or suffer to exist any
loans or advances to, or extend any credit to, or make any investments (by way
of transfer of property, contributions to capital purchase of stock or
securities or evidences of indebtedness, acquisition of the business or
assets, or otherwise) in, any Affiliate, unless prior thereto the Rating
Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect thereto; provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be prohibited under this Section 2.06(i)
from declaring or paying any dividends in respect of its common stock.

          (j) Stock; Merger. The Seller will not (i) sell any shares of any
class of its capital stock or membership interests, as applicable, to any
Person (other than DCS and its Affiliates), or enter into any transaction of
merger or consolidation unless (A) the surviving Person of such merger or
consolidation assumes all of the Seller's obligations under this Agreement,
(B) the Seller shall have given the Rating Agencies at least 10 days' prior
notice and the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect
to such transaction and (C) such merger or consolidation does not conflict
with any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or other governing
document of the Seller, or (ii) terminate, liquidate or dissolve itself (or
suffer any termination, liquidation or dissolution), or (iii) acquire or be
acquired by any Person, or (iv) otherwise make (or suffer) any material change
in the organization of or method of conducting its business.

          (k) Agreements. The Seller will not become a party to, or permit any
of its properties to be bound by, any indenture, mortgage, instrument,
contract, agreement, lease or other undertaking, except this Agreement, the
Related Documents and any document relating to a Permitted Transaction, or
amend or modify its certificate of incorporation or other governing document
or cancel, terminate, amend, supplement, modify or waive any of the provisions
of the Receivables Purchase Agreement or any of the other Related Documents or
request, consent or agree to or suffer to exist or permit any such
cancellation, termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
unless, in any such case, the Rating Agency Condition shall have been
satisfied with respect thereto.

     SECTION 2.07 Removal of Eligible Accounts.

          (a) On each Determination Date the Seller shall have the right to
remove Accounts from the Trust in the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(b). In
addition, on each Determination Date the Seller shall have the right to remove
Accounts from the Trust and, in


                                      32


<PAGE>


connection therewith, repurchase the then-existing Receivables in such
Accounts, in the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(c). In addition, on each
Determination Date the Seller shall have the right to remove DTS Accounts in
the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(f). None of the Receivables that have
been removed from the Trust shall be sold or otherwise transferred to DCS, and
DCS agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, it will not purchase or otherwise acquire such
Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not remove Accounts
from the Trust more often than once a month.

          (b) To remove Accounts, the Seller (or the Servicer on its behalf)
shall take the following actions and make the following determinations:

               (i) not less than five Business Days prior to the Removal
     Commencement Date, furnish to the Trust, the Trustee, any Agent, any
     Enhancement Providers and the Rating Agencies a written notice (the
     "Removal Notice") specifying the Determination Date (which may be the
     Determination Date on which such notice is given) on which removal of the
     Receivables of one or more Accounts will commence (a "Removal
     Commencement Date") and the Accounts the future generated Receivables of
     which are to be removed from the Trust (the "Designated Accounts");

               (ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with respect to
     such Designated Accounts the aggregate balance of Principal Receivables
     in respect of each such Designated Account (the "Designated Balance") and
     amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Trust and the Trustee a computer
     file or microfiche or written list containing a true and complete list of
     the Removed Accounts specifying for each such Account, as of the Removal
     Commencement Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of
     Receivables outstanding in such Account and the Designated Balance;

               (iii) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, cease to
     transfer to the Trust any and all Receivables arising in such Designated
     Accounts;

               (iv) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, allocate all
     Collections of Principal Receivables in respect of each such Designated
     Account, first to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     Designated Account, until the Determination Date on which the Designated
     Balance with respect to such Designated Account is reduced to zero (the
     "Removal Date");

               (v) on each Business Day from and after such Removal
     Commencement Date to and until the related Removal Date, allocate (A) to
     the Trust (to be further allocated pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement), Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal
     Receivables in respect of each Designated Account, based on the ratio of
     the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in all Designated Accounts
     sold to the Trust on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of
     Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such Business
     Day and (B) to the Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and
     Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts
     on such Business Day;


                                      33


<PAGE>


               (vi) represent and warrant that the removal of any such Eligible
     Account on any Removal Date shall not, in the reasonable belief of the
     Seller, cause an Early Redemption Event to occur or cause the Pool
     Balance to be less than the Required Participation Amount;

               (vii) represent and warrant that no selection procedures
     believed by the Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust, the

     to randomly select the Designated Accounts from the entire population of
     Accounts;

               (viii) represent and warrant as of the Removal Date that the
     list of Removed Accounts delivered pursuant to clause (ii) above, as of

     not result in the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event; the
     Trustee may conclusively rely on such Officers' Certificate and
     shall have no duty to make inquiries with regard to the matters set
     forth therein and shall incur no liability in so relying. No
     Designated Accounts shall be so removed if such removal will result
     in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any outstanding Series
     or Class by the applicable Rating Agency.

     this Agreement to the contrary, will not be released from the Collection
     Account other than pursuant to Section 4.05 of this Agreement;

               (iv) represent and warrant that the removal of any such Eligible
     Account and the repurchase of the Receivables then-existing in such

          (d) In the case of any removal of a Designated Account pursuant to
Section 2.07(b), subject to such Section 2.07(b), on the Removal Date with
respect to any such Designated Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with Section 2.07(b) and such Designated
Account shall be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes (a "Removed

statements.

          (e) In the case of any removal of Designated Accounts and repurchase
of Designated Receivables pursuant to Section 2.07(c), subject to such Section

proceeds thereof. Within five Business Days after the Removal and Repurchase
Date, the Trust and the Trustee shall execute and deliver (but shall have no
duty to prepare) to the Seller a Reassignment, together with appropriate UCC
financing statements.

Dealer Trouble Status (each, a "DTS Account"), the Seller (or the Servicer on
its behalf) shall take the following actions and make the following
determinations:

               (i) determine on the Business Day on which each such Dealer is
     placed in Dealer Trouble Status (the "DTS Removal Commencement Date") the

     "DTS Designated Balance") and amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Trust
     and the Trustee a computer file or microfiche or written list containing
     for each such DTS Account, as of the DTS Removal Commencement Date for
     such Account, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables
     outstanding in such DTS Account and the DTS Designated Balance;

     DTS Account, first, to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     DTS Account, until the Determination Date on which the DTS Balance with
     respect to such Designated Account is reduced to zero (the "DTS Removal
     Date");


                                      36


<PAGE>


               (iv) on each Business Day from and after such DTS Removal
     Commencement Date to and until the related DTS Removal Date, allocate (A)
     to the Trust (to be further allocated pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement), Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal
     Receivables in respect of each DTS Account, based on the ratio of the
     aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in all DTS Accounts sold to the
     Trust on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of Principal
     Receivables in all such DTS Accounts on such Business Day and (B) to the
     Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and Collections of
     Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such
     Business Day;

               (v) represent and warrant as of the DTS Removal Date that the
     DTS Accounts specified in clause (i) above and the DTS Designated
     Balances of such DTS Accounts, as of the DTS Removal Commencement Date,
     is true and complete in all material respects;

               (vi) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the Trustee,

          In the case of any removal of a DTS Account, on the DTS Removal Date
with respect to any such DTS Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with this Section 2.07(f) and such DTS
Account shall be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes (also a
"Removed Account"). Within five Business Days after the DTS Removal Date, the
Trust and the Trustee shall execute and deliver (but shall have no duty to
prepare) to the Seller a Reassignment, together with appropriate UCC financing
statements.

          (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Seller shall have the right to require the reassignment to it of all the
Trust's right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables
then-existing and thereafter created, all monies due or to become due and all
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof in or with
respect to the Accounts ("Automatic Removed Accounts") designated by the
Seller, upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (i) on or before the fifth Business Day immediately preceding
     the date upon which such Accounts are to be removed, the Seller shall
     have given the Trust, the Trustee, each Enhancement Provider and the
     Rating Agencies a Removal Notice specifying the date for removal of the
     Automatic Removed Accounts (the "Automatic Removal Date");

               (ii) on or prior to the date that is five Business Days after
     the Automatic Removal Date, the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust
     and the Trustee a


                                      37


<PAGE>

     complete list of the Automatic Removed Accounts specifying for each such
     Account, as of the removal notice date, its account number and the
     aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account;

               (iii) the Seller shall have represented and warranted as of each
     Automatic Removal Date that the list of Automatic Removed Accounts
     delivered pursuant to clause (ii) above, as of the Automatic Removal
     Date, is true and complete in all material respects and that the
     selection procedures for selecting the Automatic Removed Accounts were
     applied so as to randomly select the Automatic Removed Accounts from the
     entire population of Accounts;

               (iv) the Trustee shall have received confirmation from each
     Rating Agency that such removal will not result in a reduction or
     withdrawal of such Rating Agency's rating of any outstanding Series or
     Class of Certificates;

               (v) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the Trustee,
     each Rating Agency and any Enhancement Providers an Officers'
     Certificate, dated the Automatic Removal Date, to the effect that the
     Seller reasonably believes that such removal will not cause an Early
     Redemption Event to occur with respect to any Series or cause the Pool
     Balance to be less than the Required Participation Amount; and

               (vi) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the Trustee,
     each Rating Agency and any Enhancement Providers a Tax Opinion, dated the
     Automatic Removal Date, with respect to such removal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the conditions specified in (i) that
relate to Enhancement Providers and Rating Agencies and the conditions
specified in (iv), (v) and (vi) above will not be required if all of the
Accounts to be removed have been liquidated and have zero balances. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not remove Accounts from the Trust more
than once a month.

          Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, on the Automatic Removal
Date all the right, title and interest of the Trust in and to the Receivables
arising in the Automatic Removed Accounts, all monies due and to become due
and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof shall
be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes and shall be a Removed
Account.

     SECTION 2.08 Removal of Ineligible Accounts.

          (a) On any date on which an Account becomes an Ineligible Account
(which date shall be deemed to be the Removal Commencement Date) the Seller

manner prescribed in Section 2.08(b).

the Seller (or the Servicer on its behalf) shall take the following actions
and make the following determinations:

               (i) furnish to the Trust, the Trustee, any Agent and any
     Enhancement Providers a Removal Notice specifying the Removal
     Commencement Date and the Ineligible Accounts to be treated as Designated
     Accounts;

               (ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with respect to
     such Designated Accounts the Designated Balance with respect to each such
     Designated Account and amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Trust and
     the Trustee a computer file or microfiche or written list containing a
     true and complete list of the Removed Accounts specifying for each such
     Account, as of the Removal Commencement Date, its account number, the
     aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account and the
     Designated Balance;

               (iii) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, cease to
     transfer to the Trust any and all Receivables arising in such Designated
     Accounts;

               (iv) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, allocate
     Collections of Principal Receivables in respect of each Designated
     Account, first to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     Designated Account, until the Removal Date with respect thereto; and

               (v) on each Business Day from and after such Removal
     Commencement Date to and until the related Removal Date, allocate (A) to
     the Trust (to be further allocated pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement), Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal
     Receivables in respect of each Designated Account, based on the ratio of
     the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in all Designated Accounts
     sold to the Trust on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of
     Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such Business
     Day and (B) to the Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and
     Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts
     on such Business Day.

          (c) Subject to Section 2.07(b), on the Removal Date with respect to
any such Designated Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with Section 2.07(b) and such Designated
Account shall be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes (a "Removed
Account"). After the Removal Date and upon the written request of the
Servicer, the Trust and the Trustee shall deliver to the Seller a reassignment
in substantially the form of Exhibit H (the "Reassignment").

     SECTION 2.09 Sale of Ineligible Receivables.

          The Seller shall sell to the Trust on each Transfer Date any and all
Receivables arising in any Eligible Accounts that are Ineligible Receivables;
provided that (a) on the Initial Cut-Off Date or, in the case of Receivables
arising in Additional Accounts, on the related Additional Cut-Off Date, and on
the applicable Transfer Date, the Account in which such Receivables arise is
an Eligible Account and (b) the "Incremental Overcollateralization Amount"

with respect to each Series or Class of Notes is adjusted in accordance with
the definition thereof set forth in the related Indenture Supplement.

     SECTION 2.10 Representations and Warranties as to the Trust's Security
Interest in the Receivables.

          The Seller makes the following representations and warranties to the
Trust as of the Effective Date and each Transfer Date:

          (a) Except as may be expressly permitted herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, this Agreement creates a valid and continuing security
interest (as defined in the UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Trust,
which security interest is prior to all other Liens and is enforceable as such
against creditors of and purchasers from the Seller.

          (b) The Receivables constitute "tangible chattel paper", "accounts"
or "payment intangibles" within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC.

          (c) The Seller has taken all necessary steps to perfect its security
interest (if any) against account debtors on the Receivables in any property
securing the Receivables.

          (d) The Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the
Receivables free and clear of any Lien of any Person, except as permitted
under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.

          (e) The Seller has caused or will have caused, within ten days after
the date of execution of this Agreement, the filing of all appropriate
financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest
in the Receivables granted to the Trust hereunder.

          (f) Other than the security interest granted to the Trust pursuant
to this Agreement, the Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a
security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables. The Seller
has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing statements
against the Seller that include a description of collateral covering the
Receivables other than any financing statement relating to the security
interest granted to the Trust hereunder or that has been terminated. The
Seller is not aware of any judgment or tax lien filings against the Seller.

          (g) The Servicer as custodian for the Trust has in its possession
all original copies of the contracts that constitute or evidence the
Receivables, and will hold all such contracts for the benefit of the Trustee.
The contracts that constitute or evidence the Receivables do not have any
marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or
otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Trust. All financing
statements filed or to be filed against the Seller in favor of the Trust in
connection herewith and describing the Receivables contain a statement to the
following effect: "A purchase of or security interest in any collateral
described in this financing statement will violate the rights of the Secured
Party".

          (h) The Seller has received all consents and approvals (if any)
required by the terms of the Receivables to the sale of the Receivables
hereunder to the Trust.


                                      40


<PAGE>


          The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.10
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Notes.
The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.10 may not be
waived or amended except upon satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition. The
Seller covenants and agrees to take such actions as are necessary to maintain
the first priority perfected security interest of the Trust in the
Receivables.

                                 ARTICLE III

                  Administration and Servicing of Receivables

     SECTION 3.01 Acceptance of Appointment and Other Matters Relating to the
Servicer.

          (a) The Servicer shall service and administer the Receivables, shall
collect payments due under the Receivables and shall charge-off as
uncollectible Receivables, all in accordance with its customary and usual
servicing procedures for servicing wholesale receivables comparable to the
Receivables which the Servicer services for its own account and in accordance
with the Floorplan Financing Guidelines. The Servicer shall have full power
and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it
hereunder, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which it may deem necessary or desirable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 10.01, the Servicer is
hereby authorized and empowered, unless such power and authority is revoked by
the Trustee on account of the occurrence of a Service Default pursuant to
Section 10.01, (i) to instruct the Trustee to make withdrawals and payments
from the Collection Account, the Excess Funding Account and any Series Account
as set forth in this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement,
(ii) to instruct the Trustee to take any action required or permitted under
any Enhancement Agreement, (iii) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Trust, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial
or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to
the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable Requirements of
Law, to commence enforcement proceedings with respect to such Receivables,
(iv) to make any filings, reports, notices, applications, registrations with,
and seek any consents or authorizations from, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and any State securities authority on behalf of the Trust as may be
necessary or advisable to comply with any Federal or State securities laws or
reporting requirement, and (v) to delegate certain of its servicing,
collection, enforcement and administrative duties hereunder with respect to
the Accounts and the Receivables to any Person who agrees to conduct such
duties in accordance with the Floorplan Financing Guidelines and this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Servicer shall notify the Trust, the
Trustee, the Rating Agencies, any Agent and any Enhancement Providers in
writing of any such delegation of its duties which is not in the ordinary
course of its business, that no delegation will relieve the Servicer of its
liability and responsibility with respect to such duties and that the Rating
Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to any such
delegation. The Trustee or the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, shall
furnish the Servicer, at its written request therefor, with any powers of
attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer
to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.


                                      41


<PAGE>


          (b) In the event that the Seller is unable for any reason to
transfer Receivables to the Trust in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement (including by reason of an Insolvency Event occurring with respect
to the Seller, the Servicer, DCS or DaimlerChrysler, or any court of competent
jurisdiction ordering that the Seller not transfer any additional Principal
Receivables to the Trust) then, in any such event, the Servicer agrees (i) to
give prompt written notice thereof to the Trust, the Trustee, any Enhancement
Providers, any Agent and each Rating Agency and (ii) that it shall in any such
event allocate after the occurrence of such event, payments on each Account
with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the oldest
principal balance of such Account, subject to the proviso set forth in Section
2.06(b), and to have such payments applied as Collections in accordance with
Sections 4.03 and 4.04. The parties hereto agree that Non-Principal
Receivables, whenever created, accrued in respect of Principal Receivables
which have been conveyed to the Trust shall continue to be a part of the
corpus of the Trust notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer of
additional Principal Receivables to the Trust and Collections with respect
thereto shall continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

          (c) The Servicer shall not, and any Successor Servicer shall not be
obligated to, use separate servicing procedures, offices, employees or
accounts for servicing the Receivables from the procedures, offices, employees
and accounts used by the Servicer in connection with servicing other wholesale
receivables.

          (d) The Servicer shall comply with and perform its servicing
obligations with respect to the Accounts and Receivables in accordance with
the Floorplan Financing Agreements relating to the Accounts and the Floorplan
Financing Guidelines, except insofar as any failure to so comply or perform
would not materially and adversely affect the rights of the Trust, the
Noteholders or any Enhancement Providers. Subject to compliance with all
Requirements of Law, the Servicer (or DCS) may change the terms and provisions
of the Floorplan Financing Agreements or the Floorplan Financing Guidelines in
any respect (including the calculation of the amount or the timing of
charge-offs and the rate of the finance charge assessed thereon), only if (i)
as a result of such change, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer no
Early Redemption Event will occur at any time and none of the Enhancement
Providers, if any, or the Noteholders shall be adversely affected, (ii) such
change is made applicable to the comparable segment of wholesale accounts
owned or serviced by the Servicer which have characteristics the same as, or
substantially similar to, the Accounts which are the subject of such change
and (iii) in the case of a reduction in the rate of such finance charges, the
Servicer (or DCS) does not reasonably expect any such reduction to result in
the Net Receivables Rate for any Collection Period being less than the
weighted average of the sum of the "Note Interest Rates" and the applicable
rate used to calculate the Aggregate Series Servicing Fee for all outstanding
Series for the related "Interest Period" (each such term as defined in the
related Indenture Supplement).

          (e) On behalf of the Trust (to the extent of the Trust's interest
therein), the Servicer hereby agrees that it holds in trust any document in
its possession evidencing or securing a Receivable and necessary for its
servicing thereof pursuant to this Agreement. The Servicer acknowledges that
it holds any documents relating to the Receivables in its possession as agent
and bailee and custodian for the use and benefit of the Trust and the Trustee.

     SECTION 3.02 Servicing Compensation.

          (a) As full compensation for its servicing activities hereunder and
reimbursement for its expenses as set forth in the immediately following
paragraph, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee on each
Payment Date on or prior to the Trust Termination Date payable in arrears. The
"Servicing Fee" payable to the Servicer on each Payment Date in respect of any
Collection Period shall equal the product of (a) the Monthly Servicing Fee
Rate and (b) the Pool Balance as of the last day of the Collection Period
second preceding such Payment Date. A portion of the Servicing Fee shall be
allocated to each Series of Notes in accordance with the related Indenture
Supplement. The portion of the Servicing Fee so allocated to any Series of
Notes shall be paid in accordance with the related Indenture Supplement only
to the extent of funds available for such payment pursuant to such Indenture
Supplement. The sum of the portions of the Servicing Fee allocable to all
Series of Notes is referred to as the "Aggregate Series Servicing Fee". The
remainder of the Servicing Fee that is not otherwise allocated to any Series
of Notes shall be paid by the Seller and in no event shall the Trust, the
Trustee or the Noteholders be liable for the share of the Servicing Fee to be
paid by the Seller.

          (b) The Servicer's expenses include the amounts due to the Trustee
pursuant to Section 807 of the Indenture and the reasonable fees and
disbursements of independent accountants and all other expenses incurred by
the Servicer in connection with its activities hereunder, and including all
other fees and expenses of the Trust not expressly stated herein to be for the
account of the Noteholders. The Servicer shall be required to pay such
expenses for its own account, and shall not be entitled to any payment
therefor other than the Servicing Fee. The Servicer will be solely responsible
for all fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Servicer in
connection herewith and the Servicer will not be entitled to any fee or other
payment from, or claim on, any of the Collateral of the Trust (other than the
Servicing Fee).

          (c) The Servicer will be permitted, in its sole discretion, to waive
all or any portion of the Servicing Fee for any Payment Date by notice to the
Trustee on or before the related Determination Date; provided that the
Servicer believes that sufficient Collections of Non-Principal Receivables
will be available on any future Payment Date to pay the Aggregate Series
Servicing Fee relating to the waived Servicing Fee. If the Servicer so waives
all or any portion of the Servicing Fee for any Payment Date, the Servicing
Fee and the Aggregate Series Servicing Fee for such Payment Date shall be
deemed to be reduced by the amount so waived for all purposes of this
Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements; provided, however,
that such Aggregate Series Servicing Fee shall be paid on a future Payment
Date solely to the extent amounts are available therefor pursuant to the
Indenture Supplements; provided, further, that, to the extent any such waived
Aggregate Series Servicing Fee is so paid, the related portion of the
Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller shall be paid by the Seller to the
Servicer.

     SECTION 3.03 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Servicer.

          (a) DCS, as Servicer, hereby makes, and any Successor Servicer by
its appointment hereunder shall make, on the Effective Date and each
subsequent Closing Date (and on the date of any such appointment) the
following representations, warranties and covenants:


                                      43

               (i) Organization and Good Standing. Such party is a limited
     liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
     under the applicable laws of the state of its formation and has, in all
     material respects, full corporate power, authority and legal rights to
     own its properties and conduct its wholesale receivable servicing
     business as such properties are presently owned and as such business is
     presently conducted, and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
     under this Agreement.

               (ii) Due Qualification. Such party is duly qualified to do
     business and is in good standing as a foreign limited liability company
     (or is exempt from such requirements) and has obtained all necessary
     licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in which the servicing of the
     Receivables as required by this Agreement requires such qualification
     except where the failure to so qualify or obtain licenses or approvals
     would not have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its
     obligations hereunder.

               (iii) Due Authorization. The execution, delivery, and
     performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by such party by
     all necessary corporate action on the part thereof.

               (iv) Binding Obligation. This Agreement constitutes a legal,
     valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable in accordance
     with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
     now or hereinafter in effect, affecting the enforcement of creditors'
     rights and except as such enforceability may be limited by general
     principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
     equity).

               (v) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
     by such party, the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof applicable
     to such party will not conflict with, violate, result in any breach of
     any of the material terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or
     without notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under, any
     Requirement of Law applicable to such party or any indenture, contract,
     agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to which such
     party is a party or by which it is bound.

               (vi) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or, to the best
     knowledge of such party, investigations, pending or threatened against
     such party before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
     other tribunal or governmental instrumentality seeking to prevent the
     issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, seeking any determination or ruling that,
     in the reasonable judgment of such party, would materially and adversely
     affect the performance by such party of its obligations under this
     Agreement, or seeking any determination or ruling that would materially
     and adversely affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

               (vii) Compliance with Requirements of Law. Such party shall duly
     satisfy all obligations on its part to be fulfilled under or in
     connection with the


                                      44


<PAGE>


     Receivables and the Accounts, will maintain in effect all qualifications
     required under Requirements of Law in order to service properly the
     Receivables and the Accounts and will comply in all material respects
     with all Requirements of Law in connection with servicing the Receivables
     and the Accounts the failure to comply with which would have a material
     adverse effect on the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or any
     Enhancement Providers.

               (viii) No Rescission or Cancellation. Such party shall not
     permit any rescission or cancellation of a Receivable except as ordered
     by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority.

               (ix) Protection of Secured Parties' Rights. Such party shall
     take no action, nor omit to take any action, which would impair the
     rights of the Trust, the Noteholders or any Enhancement Providers in the
     Receivables nor shall it reschedule, revise or defer payments due on any
     Receivable except in accordance with the Floorplan Financing Guidelines.

               (x) Servicer Concentration Account. The Servicer maintains
     deposit accounts (collectively, the "Concentration Account") into which
     it shall deposit all amounts paid by the Dealers under Floorplan
     Financing Agreements. The Servicer agrees (i) that it will not change
     this method of collection without the prior written consent of any
     Enhancement Providers and any Agents; (ii) with respect to amounts
     deposited into the Concentration Account in respect of a particular day,
     that it will not transfer such amounts from the Concentration Account
     until the Servicer has posted all Collections in respect of the
     Receivables for such day and (iii) concurrently with the transfer of
     amounts from the Concentration Account in respect of a particular day,
     the Servicer will make the deposits and transfers required by the terms
     of this Agreement for such day.

               (xi) Negative Pledge. Except for the conveyance hereunder to the
     Trust and the Liens permitted under the Transaction Documents, the
     Servicer will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person,
     or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on, any
     Receivable sold and assigned to the Trust, whether now existing or
     hereafter created, or any interest therein, and the Servicer shall defend
     the rights, title and interest of the Trust in, to and under any
     Receivable sold and assigned to the Trust, whether now existing or
     hereafter created, against all claims of third parties claiming through
     or under the Seller or the Servicer.

          (b) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 3.03 shall survive the transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Trust and the issuance of the Notes. Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Servicer, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Agent or the Trustee
of a breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties
specified above, and to any Enhancement Providers.

          (c) Purchase. In the event any representation or warranty under
Section 3.03(a)(vii), (viii) or (ix) is not true and correct in any material
respect as of the date specified


                                      45


<PAGE>


therein with respect to any Receivable or Account and such breach has a
material adverse effect on the Noteholders' Interest in such Receivable, then,
within 30 days (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee) of
the earlier to occur of the discovery of any such event by the Seller or the
Servicer, or receipt by the Seller or the Servicer of written notice of any
such event given by the Trustee or any Enhancement Providers, the Servicer
shall purchase such Receivable or, in the case of an untrue representation
with respect to an Account, all Receivables in such Account, on the
Determination Date immediately succeeding the expiration of such 30-day period
on the terms and conditions set forth in the next succeeding paragraph;
provided, however, that no such purchase shall be required to be made with
respect to such Receivable if, by the end of such 30-day period (or such
longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee) the breached representation
or warranty shall then be true and correct in all material respects and any
material adverse effect caused thereby shall have been cured. The Servicer
shall effect such purchase by depositing in the Collection Account in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Purchase Price of such
Receivable. Any such deposit of such Purchase Price into the Collection
Account shall be considered a Transfer Deposit Amount and shall be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          Upon each such payment of such Purchase Price, the Trust shall
automatically and without further action be deemed to sell, transfer, assign,
set over and otherwise convey to the Servicer, without recourse,
representation or warranty, all right, title and interest of the Trust in and
to such Receivables, all monies due or to become due with respect thereto and
all proceeds thereof and the related Collateral Security. The Trustee shall
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall be reasonably requested by the Servicer to effect the
conveyance of any such Receivables pursuant to this Section. The obligation of
the Servicer to purchase such Receivables, and to make the deposits required
to be made to the Collection Account as provided in the preceding paragraph,
shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to such
obligation available to the Trust, the Noteholders (or the Trustee on behalf
of Noteholders).

     SECTION 3.04 Reports and Instructions for the Trustee.

          Pursuant to Section 907 of the Indenture, the Servicer will
cooperate with the Trust in completing and delivering to the Indenture Trustee
(with a copy to each Note Rating Agency) the Monthly Noteholders' Statements
provided for therein. Pursuant to Section 908 of the Indenture, the Servicer
will cooperate with the Trust in completing and delivering to the Indenture
Trustee the Payment Instructions provided for therein. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the Servicer shall calculate certain of the amounts and
percentages to be included in the Monthly Noteholders' Statements and the
Payment Instructions.

     SECTION 3.05 Annual Servicer's Certificate.

          The Servicer will deliver to the Rating Agencies, the Trustee, the
Trust, any Agent and any Enhancement Providers on or before March 31 of each
calendar year, beginning with March 31, 2005, an Officers' Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit C stating that (a) a review of the
activities of the Servicer during the preceding calendar year and of its
performance under this Agreement was made under the supervision of the officer
signing such certificate and (b) to the best of such officer's knowledge,
based on such review, the Servicer has


                                      46


<PAGE>


performed in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement
throughout such year, or, if there has been a material default in the
performance of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such
officer and the nature and status thereof. A copy of such certificate may be
obtained by any Noteholder by a request in writing to the Trustee addressed to
the Corporate Trust Office. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 3.05, the Servicer, in its sole discretion, may deliver, in lieu of
(or in addition to) the Officers' Certificate referred to above in this
Section 3.05, the report on compliance with servicing criteria that would be
required to be filed in respect of the Trust under the Exchange Act if
periodic reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or any successor
provision thereto, were required to be filed in respect of the Trust.

     SECTION 3.06 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
Report.


          The Servicer shall cause a firm of independent certified public
accountants, who may also render other services to the Servicer or to the
Seller, to deliver to the Trustee, the Trust, the Rating Agencies, each Agent
and each Enhancement Provider on or before March 31 of each year, beginning
March 31, 2005, a report addressed to the Servicer and to the Trustee, to the
effect that such firm has examined the financial statements of the Servicer
or, if applicable, the parent corporation of the Servicer, and issued its
report thereon and that such examination: (a) was made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as such firm
considered necessary in the circumstances, (b) included tests relating to
wholesale receivables (including financing arrangements with automobile
dealers to finance their automobile and light-duty truck inventory) serviced
for others in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, to the extent the procedures in such
program are applicable to the servicing obligations set forth in this
Agreement and (c) except as described in the report, disclosed no exceptions
or errors in the records relating to wholesale receivables (including
financing arrangements with automobile dealers to finance their automobile and
light-duty truck inventory) serviced for others that, in the firm's opinion,
paragraph four of such Uniform Single Attestation Program requires such firm
to report. A copy of such report may be obtained by any Noteholder by a
request in writing to the Trustee addressed to the Corporate Trust Office.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.06, the Servicer,
in its sole discretion, may deliver, in lieu of the accountants' report
referred to above in this Section 3.06, the attestation report of a registered
public accounting firm that would be required to be filed in respect of the
Trust under the Exchange Act if periodic reports under Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or any successor provision thereto, were required to be filed in
respect of the Trust.

     SECTION 3.07 Tax Treatment.

          The Seller has entered into this Agreement with the intention that
the Notes will qualify under applicable tax law as indebtedness secured by the
Receivables. The Seller agrees to treat the Notes as indebtedness secured by
the Receivables for Federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise
taxes, Michigan Single Business tax and any other taxes imposed on or measured
by income.


                                      47

     SECTION 3.08 Notices to DCS.

          In the event DCS is no longer acting as Servicer, any Successor
Servicer appointed pursuant to Section 10.02 shall deliver or make available
to DCS, as the case may be, each certificate and report required to be
prepared, forwarded or delivered thereafter pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.05
and 3.06.

     SECTION 3.09 Adjustments.

          (a) The Servicer shall adjust downward, subject to the following
sentence, the amount of any Principal Receivable because of a rebate, refund,
credit adjustment or billing error to a Dealer, or because such Receivable was
created in respect of a Vehicle which was refused or returned by a Dealer. If,
following any such adjustment downward, the Pool Balance would be less than
the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount on the immediately preceding
Determination Date (after giving effect to the allocations, distributions,
withdrawals and deposits to be made on the Payment Date following such
Determination Date), then the Seller shall be required to pay an amount equal
to such deficiency (up to the amount of such adjustment) into the Collection
Account on the Business Day on which such adjustment or reduction occurs (each
such payment, an "Adjustment Payment"). If the Seller shall fail to make any
deposit to the Collection Account with respect to such Adjustment Payment or
portion thereof by the Determination Date relating to the Collection Period
with respect to which such Adjustment Payment is payable, the amount of such
Adjustment Payment or portion thereof shall be allocated on such related
Determination Date pro rata among the then-outstanding Series based on their
respective Series Nominal Liquidation Amounts for the Collection Period with
respect to which such deposit should have been made.

          (b) If (i) the Servicer makes a deposit into the Collection Account
in respect of a Collection of a Receivable and such collection was received by
the Servicer in the form of a check which is not honored for any reason or
(ii) the Servicer makes a mistake with respect to the amount of any Collection
and deposits an amount that is less than or more than the actual amount of
such Collection, the Servicer shall appropriately adjust the amount
subsequently deposited into the Collection Account to reflect such dishonored
check or mistake. Any Receivable in respect of which a dishonored check is
received shall be deemed not to have been paid.

     SECTION 3.10 Dealer Concentrations.

          (a) On the last day of each Collection Period, the Servicer shall,
for purposes of determining the Required Participation Percentage for any
Series, determine (a) if the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables due
from either AutoNation, Inc. and its affiliates or United Auto Group, Inc. and
its affiliates at the close of business on such last day is greater than 4% of
the Pool Balance on such last day and (b) if the aggregate amount of Principal
Receivables due from any other Dealer or group of affiliated Dealers at the
close of business on such last day is greater than 1.5% of the Pool Balance on
such last day. The Servicer shall promptly provide the Trust and the Trustee a
report setting forth the basis for such determination. The Trustee upon
request from any Rating Agency will make such report available to such Rating
Agency.


                                      48


<PAGE>


          (b) On the last day of each Collection Period, the Servicer shall,
for purposes of determining the Dealer Overconcentrations that are used to
calculate the "Incremental Overcollateralization Amount" (as defined in the
related Indenture Supplement) for any Series, determine (a) if the aggregate
amount of Principal Receivables due from either AutoNation, Inc. and its
affiliates or United Auto Group, Inc. and its affiliates at the close of
business on such last day is greater than 4% of the Pool Balance on such last
day and (b) if the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables due from any
other Dealer or group of affiliated Dealers at the close of business on such
last day is greater than 2% of the Pool Balance on such last day. The Servicer
shall promptly provide the Trust and the Trustee a report setting forth the
basis for such determination. The Trustee upon request from any Rating Agency
will make such report available to such Rating Agency.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                            DEPOSIT, Allocation and
                 Application of Collections AND OTHER AMOUNTS

     SECTION 4.01 Interests in Receivables and Other Collateral.

          The Notes issued by the Trust shall represent obligations of the
Trust secured by the Collateral, which, with respect to each Series or Class,
will consist of the right to receive, to the extent necessary to make the
required payments with respect to such Series or Class at the times and in the
amounts specified in the related Indenture Supplement, (i) the portion of
Collections allocable to such Series or Class pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indenture and the related Indenture Supplement, (ii) the funds and other
property credited to the Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account (or
any subaccounts thereof) allocable to such Series or Class pursuant to this
Agreement, the Indenture and such Indenture Supplement, (iii) funds and other
property credited to any related Series Account and (iv) funds available
pursuant to any related Enhancement Agreement (such property collectively,
with respect to all Series and all Classes, the "Noteholders' Interest"); it
being understood that the Notes of any Series or Class shall not represent any
interest in any Series Account or Enhancement Agreement for the benefit of any
other Series or Class. The Seller's Certificates shall represent the ownership
interest in the remainder of the Collateral and other property of the Trust
not allocated pursuant to this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture
Supplement to the Noteholders' Interest and shall include the right to receive
Collections with respect to the Receivables and other amounts at the times and
in the amounts specified in this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture
Supplement to be released to the Trust (the "Seller's Interest"); provided,
however, that the Seller's Certificates shall not represent any interest in
the Collection Account, the Excess Funding Account, any Series Account or any
Enhancement Agreement, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the
Indenture or any Indenture Supplement.

     SECTION 4.02 Deposits of Collections into the Collection Account.

          (a) From and after the Effective Date, the Servicer shall no longer
deposit Collections into the CARCO Collection Account, and instead shall
deposit Collections directly into the Collection Account established and
maintained in the name of the Trustee pursuant to


                                      49


<PAGE>


Section 402(a) of the Indenture. The Servicer shall make deposits into the
Collection Account at such times and in such amounts as specified below in
this Section 4.02.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.02(c), the Servicer
shall deposit Collections into the Collection Account as promptly as possible
after the Date of Processing of such Collections, but in no event later than
the second Business Day after such Date of Processing.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
so long as (i) DCS remains the Servicer hereunder, (ii) no Service Default has
occurred and is continuing and (iii)(x) DCS maintains a short-term rating of
at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's (and has maintained such
short-term ratings for five Business Days following any reduction of either
such rating), (y) DCS arranges for and maintains a letter of credit or other
form of enhancement in respect of the Servicer's obligations to make deposits
of collections on the Receivables in the Collection Account that is acceptable
in form and substance to each Rating Agency and any Agents or (z) DCS
otherwise obtains the Rating Agency confirmations described below, then,
subject to any limitations in the confirmations described below, the Servicer
need not make the daily deposits of Collections into the Collection Account as
provided in this Section 4.02, but may make a single deposit into the
Collection Account in same-day or next-day funds not later than 11:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the Payment Date in a net amount equal to the amount
which would have been on deposit with respect to the immediately preceding
Collection Period in the Collection Account; provided, however, that prior to
ceasing daily deposits as described above the Seller shall have delivered to
the Trustee written confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies that the
failure by DCS to make daily deposits will not result in a reduction or
withdrawal of the rating of any outstanding Series or Class. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4.02(c), if DCS no longer maintains a
short-term rating from either Standard & Poor's or Moody's, DCS may continue
to make monthly net deposits of Collections into the Collection Account in
accordance with this Section 4.02(c) so long as (i) DCS remains the Servicer
hereunder, (ii) no Service Default has occurred and is continuing and (iii)
DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corporation maintains a short-term
rating of at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's (and has
maintained such short-term ratings for five Business Days following any
reduction of either such rating).

          (d) Subject to Section 4.04, but notwithstanding anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any Collection Period, whether
the Servicer is required to make deposits of Collections pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) above, (i) the Servicer will only be required to deposit
Collections into the Collection Account up to the aggregate amount of
Collections required to be deposited into the Excess Funding Account or any
Series Account or, without duplication, distributed on the related Payment
Date to Noteholders, to any Agent or to any Enhancement Provider pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement or Enhancement
Agreement and (ii) if at any time prior to such Payment Date the amount of
Collections deposited in the Collection Account exceeds the amount required to
be deposited pursuant to clause (i) above, the Servicer will be permitted to
withdraw the excess from the Collection Account.

          (e) Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in Section
3.01(a), the Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the Trustee, to
instruct the Trustee to make


                                      50


<PAGE>


withdrawals and payments from the Collection Account for the purposes of
carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's duties specified in this
Agreement, the Indenture or an Indenture Supplement, as the case may be.

     SECTION 4.03 Allocations of Collections and Other Amounts to Each
Series.

          (a) All Interest Collections, Principal Collections, Miscellaneous
Payments and Defaulted Amounts will be allocated to each Series from and after
the related Series Cut-Off Date according to the applicable Series Allocation
Percentage for such Series, as specified in the related Indenture Supplement.
Interest Collections, Principal Collections and Miscellaneous Payments so
allocated to any Series will not be available for the benefit of any other
Series, except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Indenture or the related Indenture Supplements, as the case may be.
Allocations of Interest Collections, Principal Collections and Miscellaneous
Payments to be performed by the Servicer (i) with respect to each Series and
(ii) if applicable, among the Classes of a Series and any related Enhancement
Provider will be set forth in the related Indenture Supplement or Supplements.
The application of such allocated Interest Collections, Principal Collections
and Miscellaneous Payments will also be set forth in the related Indenture
Supplement or Supplements.

          (b) For purposes of determining each Series' Series Allocation
Percentage in connection with the allocation of Interest Collections,
Principal Collections, Miscellaneous Payments and Defaulted Amounts for the
specified Collection Period:

               (i) unless the related Indenture Supplement shall provide
     otherwise, each Series upon issuance shall be deemed to have been created
     and in existence as of the first day of the first Collection Period to
     occur after the Series Cut-Off Date and, as a result, shall be allocated
     (based on its applicable Series Allocation Percentage) its allocable
     portion of Interest Collections, Principal Collections, Defaulted Amounts
     and Miscellaneous Payments for such Collection Period; and

               (ii) unless the related Indenture Supplement shall provide
     otherwise, with respect to any Series, if (x) as of the last day of any
     Collection Period the amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, the
     Excess Funding Account and the related Series Accounts with respect to
     such Collection Period are sufficient to pay in full all amounts payable
     by the Trust on or with respect to the Notes of such Series on the
     Payment Date relating to such Collection Period (after giving effect to
     the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on
     such related Payment Date) then (y) such Series shall be deemed to have
     been paid in full on such last day and, as a result, shall not be
     allocated any portion of Interest Collections, Principal Collections,
     Defaulted Amounts and Miscellaneous Payments for any subsequent
     Collection Period. For purposes of making the determination in clause (x)
     above, on the date of any such determination it shall be assumed that any
     theretofore unpaid Adjustment Payments with respect to the immediately
     preceding Collection Period shall be allocated to such Series on the

     SECTION 4.04 Allocations of Collections to the Seller.


          (a) Subject to Sections 4.04(c) and (d), the Servicer shall instruct
the Trustee on each Deposit Date to withdraw an amount equal to the Seller's
Percentage for the related Collection Period of Interest Collections deposited
in the Collection Account for such Deposit Date (the "Seller's Interest
Collections") and to release such Seller's Interest Collections to the Trust
for distribution in respect of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust
Agreement.

          (b) Subject to Section 4.04(c) and (d), the Servicer shall instruct
the Trustee on each Deposit Date to withdraw an amount equal to the Seller's
Percentage for the related Collection Period of Principal Collections
deposited in the Collection Account for such Deposit Date (the "Seller's
Principal Collections") and to release such Seller's Principal Collections to
the Trust for distribution in respect of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to
the Trust Agreement, so long as the Pool Balance (determined after giving
effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on such Payment
Date) equals or exceeds the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount for
the immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect to the
allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on such
Payment Date); it being understood that any Seller's Principal Collections not
otherwise released to the Trust as a result of the condition specified in this
Section 4.04(b) shall be retained in the Collection Account and included as
part of the Unallocated Principal Collections held therein.

          (c) The withdrawals to be made from the Collection Account pursuant
to Section 4.04(a) or (b) do not apply to deposits into the Collection Account
that do not represent Collections, including Miscellaneous Payments, payment
of the purchase price for the Noteholders' Interest pursuant to Section 2.03,
and proceeds from the sale, disposition or liquidation of Receivables pursuant
to an exercise of the "Put Feature" under and as defined in the Indenture or
any Indenture Supplement.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 4.04(a) or (b), with respect to each
Payment Date the Servicer shall instruct the Trustee to retain the Note PFA
Earnings Shortfall for such Payment Date from the amounts that would otherwise
be released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the Seller's
Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement and to apply such Note PFA
Earnings Shortfall under the Indenture Supplements.

     SECTION 4.05 Repurchased Receivables Purchase Price Payments.

          On each Payment Date, amounts on deposit in the Collection Account
on such Payment Date resulting from payment by the Seller of the Repurchased
Receivables Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.07(c) shall be applied as
follows: first, to fund any unpaid Miscellaneous Payments due on or prior to
such Payment Date and second, an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount
of the Repurchased Receivables Purchase Price initially deposited by the
Seller in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 2.07(c) and (ii) the
Monthly Payment Rate for the immediately preceding Collection Period, shall be
treated as Principal Collections collected in the immediately preceding
Collection Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including Section 2.07(c), the Seller shall not be required to make any
deposit into the Collection Account in respect of the Repurchased Receivables
Purchase


                                      52


<PAGE>


Price of any receivables repurchased by the Seller from the Trust pursuant to
this Agreement, including Section 2.07(c).

     SECTION 4.06 Excess Funding Account; Deposits, Allocations and
Withdrawals.

          (a) From and after the Effective Date, Excess Available Principal
Amounts shall no longer be subject to deposit into the CARCO Excess Funding
Account as provided in Section 4.04 of the Series 2002-CC Supplement, and
instead shall be subject to deposit by the Trustee into the Excess Funding
Account established and maintained in the name of the Trustee pursuant to
Section 402(b) of the Indenture. The Trustee shall make deposits into the
Excess Funding Account at such times and in such amounts as specified below in
this Section 4.06.

          (b) On each Payment Date, commencing with the initial Payment Date
hereunder, the aggregate amount of Excess Available Principal Amounts, if any,
for the related Collection Period shall be applied as follows:

               (i) first, deposited into the Excess Funding Account in an
     amount equal to the excess, if any, of:

                    (A) the sum of (1) the aggregate Outstanding Dollar
          Principal Amount of all Series of Notes and (2) the sum of the
          Overcollateralization Amounts for all Series of Notes; over

                    (B) the sum of (1) the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation
          Amount, (2) the aggregate amount on deposit in the Principal Funding
          Accounts (other than any net investment earnings) for all Series of
          Notes and (3) the amount on deposit in the Excess Funding Account
          (other than any net investment earnings); it being understood that,
          solely for the purpose of this subclause (B), the Aggregate Series
          Nominal Liquidation Amount will be reduced by an amount equal to the
          quotient obtained by dividing (x) the excess, if any, of the
          Required Participation Amount (less the sum of the Incremental
          Overcollateralization Amounts for all Series) over the Pool Balance
          (less the sum of the Overconcentration Amount and the aggregate
          amount of Ineligible Receivables), in each case, after giving effect
          to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on that
          Payment Date and the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
          deposits to be made on that Payment Date (other than any deposits
          into the Excess Funding Account that may be required to be made on
          that Payment Date) by (y) the sum of the weighted average of the
          Required Participation Percentages for each Series of Notes plus the
          weighted average of the Overcollateralization Percentages used
          for purposes of determining the Overcollateralization Amounts for
          each Series of Notes; and

               (ii) second, after giving effect to the immediately preceding
     clause (i), the remaining Excess Available Principal Amounts, if any,
     shall be released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the
     Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement, so long as the
     Pool Balance (determined after giving effect to any Principal Receivables
     transferred to the Trust on such Payment Date) equals or exceeds the
     Aggregate Series


                                      53


<PAGE>


     Nominal Liquidation Amount for the immediately preceding Determination
     Date (after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals
     and deposits to be made on such Payment Date); it being understood that
     any Excess Available Principal Amounts not otherwise paid to the Trust as
     a result of the condition specified in this clause (ii) shall be
     transferred to the Collection Account and included as part of the
     Unallocated Principal Collections held therein.

          (c) All interest and earnings (net of losses and investment
expenses) on funds on deposit in the Excess Funding Account shall be allocated
to each Series of Notes pro rata on the basis of its Series Nominal
Liquidation Amount and on each Payment Date shall be withdrawn by the Trustee
for application under the Indenture Supplement for such Series of Notes;
provided, however, that beginning on the second Payment Date following the end
of the revolving period for a Series of Notes, no further net investment
earnings on funds in the Excess Funding Account shall be allocated to such
Series of Notes, unless the revolving period for such Series has recommenced
in accordance with the related Indenture Supplement.

          (d) Amounts (other than investment earnings) being deposited to the
Excess Funding Account from Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to
Section 4.06(b)(i) shall be allocated to each Series of Notes (other than any
Series of Notes that is not in its revolving period) pro rata on the basis of
its Series Nominal Liquidation Amount. On the Payment Date next following the
end of the revolving period for a Series of Notes, any funds (other than
investment earnings) on deposit in the Excess Funding Account that are
allocable to such Series of Notes shall be withdrawn by the Trustee for
application under the Indenture Supplement for such Series of Notes.

          (e) On each Determination Date, the Seller shall determine whether
the sum of the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount (after giving
effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made
on the Payment Date following such Determination Date), the amount on deposit
in the Excess Funding Account (other than any investment earnings) and the
amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Accounts for all Series of Notes
(other than any investment earnings) is greater than the aggregate Outstanding
Dollar Principal Amount of all Series of Notes plus the aggregate
Overcollateralization Amount for all Series of Notes. If on any such
Determination Date such sum is greater than the aggregate Outstanding
Principal Dollar Amount of all Series of Notes plus the aggregate
Overcollateralization Amount for all Series of Notes and thus there are
sufficient Principal Receivables in the Trust to permit an increase in the
Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount without causing an Early
Redemption Event to occur with respect to any outstanding Series of Notes, the
Seller shall notify the Trustee of the amount of the increase in the Aggregate
Series Nominal Liquidation Amount. Subject to the provisions set forth below
in this Section 4.06(e), upon receipt of such notice, the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount shall be increased by the amount specified, and the
Servicer shall instruct the Trustee to withdraw from the Excess Funding
Account and release to the Trust for distribution pursuant to the Trust
Agreement on the immediately succeeding Payment Date, an amount equal to the
amount of such increase in the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount.
Such payment shall be in payment or partial payment pursuant to the
Receivables Purchase Agreement for additional Principal Receivables
transferred to the Trust. To the extent that the Aggregate Series Nominal
Liquidation Amount is increased by release of funds to the Trust, the Seller's
Interest shall be


                                      54


<PAGE>


reduced by the amount of such payment. Such increase in the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount shall be allocated among each Series of Notes
(other than any Series of Notes that is not in its revolving period) pro rata
on the basis of the Series Nominal Liquidation Amounts of such Series of
Notes. In addition, any increase in the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation
Amount is subject to the condition that, after giving effect to such increase,
the Pool Balance equals or exceeds the Required Participation Amount (after
giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits). In
connection with the foregoing release of funds from the Excess Funding
Account, the Seller shall endeavor (taking into account any seasonality
experienced in the Accounts in the Trust) to minimize the amounts on deposit,
from time to time, in the Excess Funding Account.

          (f) Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in Section
3.01(a), the Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the Trustee, to
instruct the Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the Excess Funding
Account for the purposes of carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's
duties specified in this Agreement, the Indenture or an Indenture Supplement,
as the case may be.

     SECTION 4.07 Unallocated Principal Collections.

          The sum of those Seller's Principal Collections retained in the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 4.04(b) and those Excess Available
Principal Amounts transferred to the Collection Account pursuant to Section
4.06(b)(ii) (such sum, the "Unallocated Principal Collections") shall be
released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the Seller's Certificates
pursuant to the Trust Agreement at the time the Pool Balance (determined after
giving effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust at such
time) exceeds the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount for the
immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect to the
allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on the Payment
Date immediately following such Determination Date); provided, however, that
any Unallocated Principal Collections on deposit in the Collection Account at
any time during which any Series is not in its revolving period shall be
deemed to be Miscellaneous Payments and shall be allocated to each Series as
provided in Section 4.03(a).

                     OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE SELLER

     SECTION 7.01 Liability of the Seller.

          The Seller shall be liable for all obligations, covenants,
representations and warranties of the Seller arising under or related to this
Agreement. Except as provided in the


                                      55


<PAGE>


preceding sentence, the Seller shall be liable only to the extent of the
obligations specifically undertaken by it in its capacity as Seller hereunder.

     SECTION 7.02 Limitation on Liability of the Seller.

          Subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.03, neither the Seller nor any of the
directors or officers or employees or agents of the Seller in its capacity as
Seller shall be under any liability to the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the
Trustee, the Noteholders or any other Person for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in the capacity as Seller pursuant to
this Agreement whether arising from express or implied duties under this
Agreement; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Seller
or any such Person against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by
reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and
duties hereunder. The Seller and any director or officer or employee or agent
of the Seller may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie
properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising
hereunder.

     SECTION 7.03 Seller Indemnification of the Trust, the Trustee, the
Owner Trustee and the Enhancement Providers.

          The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trustee,
the Owner Trustee and the Enhancement Providers, from and against any loss,
liability, expense, damage or injury suffered or sustained by reason of any
acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions arising out of activities of the
Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, including
any judgment, award, settlement, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs or
expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened
action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that the Seller shall not
indemnify the Trust, the Trustee, the Owner Trustee or any Enhancement
Provider if the acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions of such Person
constitute fraud, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty or willful
misconduct by such Person; and provided, further, that the Seller shall not
indemnify the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee for any liabilities,
cost or expense of the Trust with respect to any action taken by such Person
at the request of any Noteholder, Enhancement Provider or holder of a
Supplemental Certificate to the extent the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, is indemnified by such Noteholder, Enhancement
Provider or holder of a Supplemental Certificate with respect to such action,
or with respect to any Federal, state or local income or franchise taxes (or
any interest or penalties with respect thereto) required to be paid by the
Trust or any Noteholder, Enhancement Provider or holder of a Supplemental
Certificate in connection herewith or with the Notes, the Indenture, any
Indenture Supplement, any Enhancement Agreement, the Supplemental Certificates
or the Trust Agreement to any taxing authority. Subject to Section 7.01, any
indemnification pursuant to this Section shall only be from (i) the excess of
the Seller's Interest for any date of determination over the Required
Participation Amount as of such date and (ii) any other assets of the Seller
not pledged to third parties or otherwise encumbered in a manner permitted by
the Seller's organizational documents and shall only be made after payment in
full of any amounts that the Seller is obligated to deposit in the Collection
Account pursuant to this Agreement. Any indemnification under this Article VII
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

under any liability to the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee, the
Noteholders or any other Person for any action taken or for refraining from

          The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the

any acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions arising out of activities of
the Servicer, the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee pursuant to this

willful misconduct by such Person; and provided, further, that the Servicer
shall not indemnify the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee for any

Provider or holder of a Seller's Certificate with respect to such action, or
with respect to any Federal, state or local income or franchise taxes (or any
interest or penalties with respect thereto) required to be paid by the Trust
or any Noteholder, Enhancement Provider or holder of a Seller's Certificate in
connection herewith or with the Notes, the Indenture, any Indenture
Supplement, any Enhancement Agreement, the Seller's Certificates or the Trust
Agreement to any taxing authority. Any indemnification under this Article VIII
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation and
removal of the Trustee.

     SECTION 8.05 The Servicer Not to Resign.

          The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon determination that (a) the performance of its duties
hereunder is no longer permissible under applicable law and (b) there is no
reasonable action which the Servicer could take to make the performance of its
duties hereunder permissible under applicable law. Any such determination
permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced as to clause (a)
above by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Trust and the
Trustee. No such resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or a
Successor Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of
the Servicer in accordance with Section 10.02 hereof. If the Trustee is unable
within 120 days of the date of such determination to appoint a Successor
Servicer, the Trustee shall serve as Successor Servicer hereunder.

     SECTION 8.06 Access to Certain Documentation and Information
Regarding the Receivables.

          The Servicer shall provide to the Trustee access to the
documentation regarding the Accounts and the Receivables in such cases where
the Trustee is required in connection with the enforcement of the rights of
the Noteholders, or by applicable statutes or regulations to review such
documentation, such access being afforded without charge but only (a) upon
reasonable request, (b) during normal business hours, (c) subject to the
Servicer's normal security and confidentiality procedures and (d) at offices
designated by the Servicer. Nothing in


                                      59


<PAGE>


this Section 8.06 shall derogate from the obligation of the Seller, the Trust,
the Trustee or the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting
disclosure of information regarding the Dealers and the failure of the
Servicer to provide access as provided in this Section 8.06 as a result of
such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section 8.06.

     SECTION 8.07 Delegation of Duties.

          Subject to Section 3.01, in the ordinary course of business, the
Servicer may at any time delegate any duties hereunder to any Person who
agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with the Floorplan Financing
Guidelines and this Agreement. The Servicer shall give prompt written notice
of any such delegation of a material function to the Note Rating Agencies, any
Agent and any Enhancement Providers. Such delegation shall not relieve the
Servicer of its liability and responsibility with respect to such duties, and
shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section 8.05 and the
Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to such
delegation prior to such delegation.

     SECTION 8.08 Examination of Records.

          The Seller and the Servicer shall indicate generally in its computer
files or other records that the Receivables arising in the Accounts have been
conveyed to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller and the Servicer
shall, prior to the sale or transfer to a third party of any receivable held
in its custody, examine its computer and other records to determine that such
receivable is not a Receivable.

     SECTION 8.09 Optional Repurchase by the Servicer.

          Pursuant to Section 1202 of the Indenture, and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, the Servicer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to cause the Trust to redeem a Series or Class of Notes in whole
but not in part by paying to the Trust the applicable redemption price for
such Series or Class of Notes.

          (a) any failure by the Servicer to make any payment, transfer or
deposit or to give instructions or to give notice to the Trustee to make such
payment, transfer or deposit or to give notice to the Trustee as to any action

instruction or notice is required to be made or given, as the case may be,
under the terms of this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement;

          (b) failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or perform
any other covenants or agreements of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement,
the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement which has a material adverse effect
on the Noteholders of any Series, which continues unremedied for a period of
30 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the
same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the Trustee; or
the Servicer shall delegate its duties under this Agreement, except as
permitted by Sections 3.01 and 8.07;

          (c) any representation, warranty or certification made by the
Servicer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall prove to have been incorrect when made, which has a material
adverse effect on the rights of the Noteholders of any Series and which
material adverse effect continues for a period of 60 days after the date on
which written notice thereof, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
been given to the Servicer by the Trustee;

          (d) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator
or receiver or liquidator or other similar official in any bankruptcy,
insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or
similar proceedings of or relating to the Servicer or of or relating to all or
substantially all of its property, or a decree or order of a court or agency
or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises for the
appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or other similar
official in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and
liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of
its affairs, shall have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or
order shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed; or the Servicer
shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization statute, make any assignment for the benefit of
its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations;

then, in the event of any Service Default, so long as the Service Default
shall not have been remedied, the Trustee, by notice then given in writing to
the Servicer (a "Termination Notice"), may terminate all but not less than all
of the rights and obligations (other than its obligations that have accrued up
to the time of such termination) of the Servicer as Servicer under this
Agreement and in and to the Receivables and the proceeds thereof. After
receipt by the Servicer of a Termination Notice, and on the date that a
Successor Servicer shall have been appointed by the Trustee pursuant to
Section 10.02, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement
shall pass to and be vested in a Successor Servicer (a "Service Transfer")
and, without limitation, the Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered (upon
the failure of the Servicer to cooperate) to execute and deliver, on behalf of
the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other
instruments upon the failure of the Servicer to execute or deliver such
documents or instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such Service Transfer. The
Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Trustee and such Successor Servicer in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer
to conduct servicing hereunder, including the transfer to such Successor
Servicer of all authority of the Servicer to service the Receivables provided
for


                                      61
<PAGE>


under this Agreement, including all authority over all Collections which shall
on the date of transfer be held by the Servicer for deposit, or which have
been deposited by the Servicer, in the Collection Account, or which shall
thereafter be received with respect to the Receivables, and in assisting the
Successor Servicer. The Servicer shall promptly transfer its electronic
records relating to the Receivables to the Successor Servicer in such
electronic form as the Successor Servicer may reasonably request and shall
promptly transfer to the Successor Servicer all other records, correspondence
and documents necessary for the continued servicing of the Receivables in the
manner and at such times as the Successor Servicer shall reasonably request.
To the extent that compliance with this Section 10.01 shall require the
Servicer to disclose to the Successor Servicer information of any kind which
the Servicer reasonably deems to be confidential, the Successor Servicer shall
be required to enter into such customary licensing and confidentiality
agreements as the Servicer shall deem necessary to protect its interest.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance
under Section 10.01(a) for a period of ten Business Days or under Section
10.01(b) or (c) for a period of 60 Business Days shall not constitute a
Service Default if such delay or failure could not be prevented by the
exercise of reasonable diligence by the Servicer and such delay or failure was
caused by an act of God or the public enemy, acts of declared or undeclared
war, public disorder, rebellion or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning,
fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or similar causes. The preceding
sentence shall not relieve the Servicer from using its best efforts to perform
its respective obligations in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Servicer shall provide the Trustee, any Agents, any
Enhancement Providers, the Seller, the Trust and the Noteholders with an
Officers' Certificate giving prompt notice of such failure or delay by it,
together with a description of its efforts so to perform its obligations. The
Servicer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the Seller and the Rating
Agencies in writing of any Service Default.

     SECTION 10.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

          (a) On and after the receipt by the Servicer of a Termination Notice
pursuant to Section 10.01, the Servicer shall continue to perform all
servicing functions under this Agreement until the date specified in the
Termination Notice or otherwise specified by the Trustee in writing or, if no
such date is specified in such Termination Notice, or otherwise specified by
the Trustee, until a date mutually agreed upon by the Servicer and the
Trustee. The Trustee shall as promptly as possible after the giving of a
Termination Notice appoint an Eligible Servicer as a successor servicer (the
"Successor Servicer"), subject to the consent of any Enhancement Providers and
any Agents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and such
Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a
form acceptable to the Trustee. In the event that a Successor Servicer has not
been appointed or has not accepted its appointment at the time when the
Servicer ceases to act as Servicer, the Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer. The Trustee may delegate
any of its servicing obligations to an affiliate or agent in accordance with
Sections 3.01 and 8.07. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee shall, if it is
legally unable so to act, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint any established institution having a net worth of not less than
$100,000,000 and whose regular business includes the servicing of wholesale
receivables as the Successor Servicer hereunder. The Trustee shall immediately
give notice to


                                      62


<PAGE>


the Trust, the Note Rating Agencies, any Enhancement Providers, any Agents and
the Noteholders upon the appointment of a Successor Servicer.

          (b) Upon its appointment, the Successor Servicer shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer with respect to servicing functions
under this Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and
provisions hereof (except that the Successor Servicer shall not be liable for
any liabilities incurred by the predecessor Servicer), and all references in
this Agreement to the Servicer shall be deemed to refer to the Successor
Servicer. Any Successor Servicer, by its acceptance of its appointment, will
automatically agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of any Enhancement
Agreement.

          (c) In connection with any Termination Notice, the Trustee will
review any bids which it obtains from Eligible Servicers and shall be
permitted to appoint any Eligible Servicer submitting such a bid as a
Successor Servicer for servicing compensation not in excess of the Servicing
Fee (provided that if all such bids exceed the Servicing Fee the Seller at its
own expense shall pay when due the amount of any compensation in excess of the
Servicing Fee); provided, however, that the Seller shall be responsible for
payment of the Seller's portion of the Servicing Fee as determined pursuant to
this Agreement and all other amounts in excess of the Aggregate Series
Servicing Fee, and that no such monthly compensation paid out of Collections
shall be in excess of the Aggregate Series Servicing Fee permitted to the
Servicer. The holders of the Seller's Certificates agree that if DCS (or any
Successor Servicer) is terminated as Servicer hereunder, the portion of
Collections to be released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the
Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement shall be reduced by an
amount sufficient to pay Seller's share of the compensation of the Successor
Servicer.

          (d) All authority and power granted to the Successor Servicer under
this Agreement shall automatically cease and terminate upon termination of the
Trust pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Trust Agreement, and shall pass to and
be vested in the Seller and, without limitation, the Seller is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Successor
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other
instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing rights. The
Successor Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Seller in effecting the
termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Successor Servicer to
conduct servicing on the Receivables. The Successor Servicer shall transfer
its electronic records relating to the Receivables to the Seller in such
electronic form as the Seller may reasonably request and shall transfer all
other records, correspondence and documents to the Seller in the manner and at
such times as the Seller shall reasonably request. To the extent that
compliance with this Section 10.02 shall require the Successor Servicer to
disclose to the Seller information of any kind which the Successor Servicer
deems to be confidential, the Seller shall be required to enter into such
customary licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Successor Servicer
shall deem necessary to protect its interests.

     SECTION 12.01 Termination of Agreement.

          This Agreement and the respective obligations and responsibilities
of the Seller, the Servicer and the Trust shall terminate, except with respect
to the duties described in Sections 7.03 and 8.04, upon the Trust Termination
Date. The Servicer will give the Rating Agencies prompt notice of the
occurrence of the Trust Termination Date.

                                 ARTICLE XIII

                           Miscellaneous Provisions

     SECTION 13.01 Amendment.

          (a) This Agreement may be amended from time to time (including in
connection with the issuance of a Supplemental Certificate pursuant to the
Trust Agreement) by the Servicer, the Seller and the Trust without the consent
of any of the Noteholders; provided that (i) such action shall not, as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel for the Seller, addressed and delivered to
the Trust and the Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Noteholder and (ii) the Trustee shall have received written
confirmation from each Note Rating Agency that such amendment will not have a
Ratings Effect.

          (b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time (including
in connection with the issuance of a Supplemental Certificate pursuant to the
Trust Agreement) by the Servicer, the Seller and the Trust, with the consent
of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 66-2/3% of the aggregate
Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes of all adversely affected
Series or Classes, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders; provided, however, that
no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of or delay the
timing of any distributions to be made to Noteholders or deposits of amounts
to be so distributed or the amount available under any Enhancement Agreement
without the consent of each affected Noteholder, (ii) change the definition of
or the manner of calculating the interest of any Noteholder without the
consent of each affected Noteholder, (iii) reduce the aforesaid percentage
required to consent to any such amendment without the consent of each
Noteholder or (iv) adversely affect the rating of any Series or Class by each
Note Rating Agency without the consent of each affected Noteholder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any amendment to be
effected pursuant to this paragraph (b) without the consent of each adversely
affected Noteholder shall be subject to the Trustee's receipt of written
confirmation from each applicable Note Rating Agency that such amendment will
not have a Ratings Effect with respect to the adversely affected Notes.


                                      64
<PAGE>


Any amendment to be effected pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be deemed to
adversely affect all outstanding Series and Classes, other than any Series or
Class with respect to which such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion
of Counsel for the Seller, addressed and delivered to the Trust and the
Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any
Noteholder of such Series or Class. The Owner Trustee may, but shall not be
obligated to, enter into on behalf of the Trust any such amendment which
affects the Owner Trustee's rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement
or otherwise.

          (c) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent
(other than an amendment pursuant to paragraph (a)), the Servicer shall
furnish notification of the substance of such amendment to the Trustee, each
Rating Agency, each Agent and each Enhancement Provider. Upon its receipt of
any such notice, the Trustee shall promptly forward a copy of such notice to
each Noteholder in accordance with the Indenture.

          (d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders under
this Section 13.01 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment,
but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance
thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders shall be subject to such
reasonable requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.

          (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no
amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Enhancement Provider without the consent
of such Enhancement Provider.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no
amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any holders of the Seller's Certificates
issued by the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement without the consent of the
holders of Seller's Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the
Percentage Interests (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the outstanding
Seller's Certificates.

     SECTION 13.02 Protection of Right, Title and Interest to Trust.

          (a) The Servicer shall cause this Agreement, all amendments hereto
and/or all financing statements and continuation statements and any other
necessary documents covering the Trust's right, title and interest in and to
the Receivables and the Collateral Security to be promptly recorded,
registered and filed, and at all times to be kept recorded, registered and
filed, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law fully
to preserve and protect the right, title and interest of the Trust hereunder.
The Servicer shall deliver to the Trust and the Trustee file-stamped copies
of, or filing receipts for, any document recorded, registered or filed as
provided above, as soon as available following such recording, registration or
filing. The Seller shall cooperate fully with the Servicer in connection with
the obligations set forth above and will execute any and all documents
reasonably required to fulfill the intent of this Section 13.02(a).

          (b) Within 30 days after the Seller or the Servicer makes any change
in its name, identity or corporate structure which would make any financing
statement or continuation


                                      65


<PAGE>


statement filed in accordance with Section 13.02(a) seriously misleading
within the meaning of Section 9-506 of the UCC (including as a result of a
Designated Affiliate Transfer), the Seller shall give the Trust, the Trustee
and any Agent notice of any such change and shall file such financing
statements or amendments as may be necessary to continue the perfection of the
Trust's security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.

          (c) The Seller and the Servicer will give the Trust, the Trustee and
any Agent prompt written notice of any relocation of any office from which it
services Receivables or keeps records concerning the Receivables or of its
principal executive office and whether, as a result of such relocation, the
applicable provisions of the UCC would require the filing of any amendment of
any previously filed financing or continuation statement or of any new
financing statement and shall file such financing statements or amendments as
may be necessary to perfect or to continue the perfection of the Trust's
security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof. The Seller and
the Servicer will at all times maintain each office from which it services
Receivables and its principal executive officer within the United States of
America.

          (d) The Servicer will deliver to the Trust, the Trustee, any Agent
and any Enhancement Provider: (i) upon the execution and delivery of each
amendment of this Agreement, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect specified in
Exhibit G-1; (ii) on each Addition Date on which any Additional Accounts are

                                    FORM OF
               ASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS

                         (As required by Section 2.05
                     of the Sale and Servicing Agreement)


          ASSIGNMENT NO. ___ OF RECEIVABLES IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS dated as of
_______________, _____ (this "Assignment"), among DaimlerChrysler Wholesale
Receivables LLC, as seller (the "Seller"), DaimlerChrysler Services North
America LLC, as servicer (the "Servicer"), and DaimlerChrysler Master Owner
Trust (the "Trust"), pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement referred to
below.

                                  WITNESSETH:

          WHEREAS the Seller, the Servicer and the Trust are parties to a Sale
and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended or
supplemented, the "Agreement");

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, the Seller wishes to designate
Additional Accounts to be included as Accounts and to convey the Receivables
and related Collateral Security of such Additional Accounts, whether now
existing or hereafter created, to the Trust which, in turn, shall grant a
security interest in all such conveyed property to the Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture (as each such term is defined in the Agreement); and

          WHEREAS the Trust is willing to accept such designation and
conveyance subject to the terms and conditions hereof;

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Seller, the Servicer and the Trust hereby agree
as follows:

          1. Defined Terms. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.

          "Addition Date" shall mean, with respect to the Additional Accounts
     designated hereby, _________________, _____.

          "Additional Accounts" shall mean, the Additional Accounts, as
     defined in the Agreement, that are designated hereby and listed on
     Schedule 1 hereto.

          "Additional Cut-Off Date" shall mean, with respect to the Additional
     Accounts designated hereby, ___________, _____.

          2. Designation of Additional Accounts. The Seller hereby delivers
herewith a computer file or microfiche or written list containing a true and
complete list of all such


                                     B-1


<PAGE>


Additional Accounts specifying for each such Account, as of the Additional
Cut-Off Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables
outstanding in such Account and the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
in such Account. Such file, microfiche or list shall be marked as Schedule 1
to this Assignment and shall, as of the date of this Assignment, be
incorporated into and made a part of this Assignment and shall supplement
Schedule 1 to the Agreement.

          3. Conveyance of Receivables. (a) The Seller does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey, without recourse (except as
expressly provided in the Agreement), to the Trust, all of its right, title
and interest in, to and under the Receivables in such Additional Accounts and
all Collateral Security with respect thereto owned by the Seller and existing
at the close of business on the Additional Cut-Off Date and thereafter created
from time to time until the termination of the Trust, all monies due or to
become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds
(including Recoveries) thereof. The foregoing sale, transfer, assignment,
set-over and conveyance does not constitute, and is not intended to result in
the creation or an assumption by the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee,
any Agent, any Noteholder or any Enhancement Provider of any obligation of the
Servicer, the Seller, DCS, DaimlerChrysler or any other Person in connection
with the Accounts, the Receivables or under any agreement or instrument
relating thereto, including any obligation to any Dealers.

          (b) In connection with such sale, the Seller agrees to record and
file, at its own expense, a financing statement on form UCC-1 (and
continuation statements when applicable) with respect to the Receivables now
existing and hereafter created for the sale of "tangible chattel paper",
"accounts" or "payment intangibles" (each as defined in Section 9-102 of the
UCC as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction) meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect the sale and assignment of the Receivables and the Collateral
Security to the Trust, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing
statements or other evidence of such filing to the Trustee on or prior to the
Addition Date. The Trustee shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file
such financing statement, or a continuation statement to such financing
statement, or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection with such
sales.

          (c) In connection with such sale, the Seller further agrees, at its
own expense, on or prior to the Addition Date, to indicate in its computer
files that the Receivables created in connection with the Additional Accounts
designated hereby have been sold and the Collateral Security assigned to the
Trust pursuant to this Assignment, and pledged by the Trust to the Trustee for
the benefit of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the
Indenture.

          (d) The parties hereto intend that the transfers of Receivables and
related Collateral Security effected by this Assignment be sales.
Nevertheless, if such transfers are deemed to be transfers for security, then
this Assignment also shall be deemed to be and hereby is a security agreement
within the meaning of the UCC, and the conveyance by the Seller provided for
in this Assignment shall also be deemed to be and hereby is a grant by the
Seller to the Trust of a security interest in all of the Seller's right, title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under such
Receivables and related Collateral Security. For tax purposes, the parties
hereto intend that all transfers of Receivables and related Collateral
Security


                                      B-2


<PAGE>


under this Assignment constitute transfers of such Receivables and
related Collateral Security as security for a loan.

          4. Acceptance by the Trust. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6 of this Assignment, the Trust hereby
acknowledges its acceptance of all right, title and interest previously held
by the Seller to the property, now existing and hereafter created, conveyed to
the Trust pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Assignment. The Trust further
acknowledges that, prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Assignment, the Seller delivered to the Trust and the Trustee the
computer file or microfiche or written list relating to the Additional
Accounts described in Section 2 of this Assignment. The Trustee shall be under
no obligation whatsoever to verify the accuracy or completeness of the
information contained in such file or list.

          5. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Trust as of the date of this Assignment and as
of the Addition Date that:

               (a) Legal, Valid and Binding Obligation. This Assignment
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
     enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
     effect affecting creditors' rights in general and except as such
     enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity (whether
     considered in a suit at law or in equity);

               (b) Eligible Accounts. Each Additional Account designated
     hereby is an Eligible Account;

               (c) Selection Procedures. No selection procedures believed by
     the Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust, the
     Noteholders or any Enhancement Providers were utilized in selecting
     the Additional Accounts designated hereby;

               (d) Insolvency. As of the Notice Date and the Addition Date,
     the Seller is not insolvent nor, after giving effect to the
     conveyance set forth in Section 3 of this Assignment, will the
     Seller have been made insolvent, nor is the Seller aware of any
     pending insolvency;

               (e) Valid Transfer. This Assignment constitutes a valid sale,
     transfer and assignment to the Trust of all right, title and
     interest of the Seller in the Receivables and the Collateral
     Security and the proceeds thereof and upon the filing of the
     financing statements described in Section 3 of this Assignment with
     the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and other applicable
     states and, in the case of the Receivables and the Collateral
     Security hereafter created and the proceeds thereof, upon the
     creation thereof, the Trust shall have a first priority perfected
     ownership interest in such property, subject to the rights of the
     Purchased Receivables Owners in any Collateral Security in respect
     of the Partial Accounts (other than the Vehicles relating to
     Principal Receivables arising in the Partial Accounts), except for
     Liens permitted under the Receivables Purchase


                                     B-3


<PAGE>


     Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement and except for
     Liens permitted under the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the other
     Transaction Documents, neither the Seller nor any Person claiming through
     or under the Seller has any claim to or interest in the Collateral of the
     Trust;

               (f) No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Assignment,
     the performance of the transactions contemplated by this Assignment
     and the fulfillment of the terms hereof, will not conflict with,
     result in any breach of any of the material terms and provisions of,
     or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a
     material default under, any indenture, contract, agreement,
     mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to which the Seller is
     a party or by which it or its properties are bound;

               (g) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Assignment
     by the Seller, the performance of the transactions contemplated by
     this Assignment and the fulfillment of the terms hereof applicable
     to the Seller will not conflict with or violate any material
     Requirements of Law applicable to the Seller;

               (h) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or, to the best
     knowledge of the Seller, investigations pending or threatened
     against the Seller before any Governmental Authority (i) asserting
     the invalidity of this Assignment, (ii) seeking to prevent the
     consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
     Assignment, (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that, in the
     reasonable judgment of the Seller, would materially and adversely
     affect the performance by the Seller of its obligations under this
     Assignment, (iv) seeking any determination or ruling that would
     materially and adversely affect the validity or enforceability of
     this Assignment or (v) seeking to affect adversely the income tax
     attributes of the Trust under the United States Federal or any State
     income, single business or franchise tax systems;

               (i) Record of Accounts. As of the Addition Date, Schedule 1 to
     this Assignment is an accurate and complete listing in all material
     respects of all the Additional Accounts as of the Additional Cut-Off
     Date and the information contained therein with respect to the
     identity of such Accounts and the Receivables existing thereunder is
     true and correct in all material respects as of the Additional
     Cut-Off Date;

               (j) No Liens. Each Receivable and all Collateral Security
     existing on the Addition Date has been conveyed to the Trust free
     and clear of any Lien, subject to the rights of the Purchased
     Receivables Owners in any Collateral Security in respect of the
     Partial Accounts (other than the Vehicles relating to Principal
     Receivables arising in the Partial Accounts) and except for Liens
     permitted under the Receivables Purchase Agreement;

               (k) All Consents Required. With respect to each Receivable and
     all Collateral Security existing on the Addition Date, all consents,
     licenses, approvals or authorizations of or registrations or
     declarations with any Governmental Authority required to be
     obtained, effected or given by the Seller in connection with the
     conveyance of such Receivable or Collateral Security to the Trust,

     have been duly obtained, effected or given and are in full force and

     Receivable conveyed to the Trust as of such date is an Eligible
     Receivable or, if such Receivable is not an Eligible Receivable,
     such Receivable is conveyed to the Trust in accordance with Section

             Provisions to be Included in Opinion of Counsel to be
                   Delivered Pursuant to Section 13.02(d)(i)


          (i) The Amendment to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, attached
hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Amendment"), has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Seller and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement
of the Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally from time to time in effect. The enforceability of the Seller's
obligations is also subject to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          (ii) The Amendment has been entered into in accordance with the
terms and provisions of Section 13.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

          (iii) The Amendment will not adversely affect in any material
respect the interests of the Noteholders. [Include this clause (iii) only in
the case of amendments effected pursuant to Section 13.01(a) of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement.]

                                    FORM OF
                              OPINION OF COUNSEL

             Provisions to be Included in Opinion of Counsel to be
            Delivered Pursuant to Section 13.02(d)(ii) and (iii)*


          The opinions set forth below may be subject to all the
qualifications, assumptions, limitations and exceptions taken or made in the
opinion of counsel to DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC (the "Seller")
delivered on any Closing Date. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
are used as defined in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of December
16, 2004 (as amended and supplemented, the "Sale and Servicing Agreement"),
among the Seller, as seller, DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC, as
servicer (the "Servicer"), and DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust (the
"Trust").

          [(a) The Assignment has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Seller, and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms.]

          (b) Assuming the Receivables [in the Additional Accounts] are
created under, and are evidenced solely by, Floorplan Financing Agreements,
such Receivables will constitute "tangible chattel paper", "accounts" or
"payment intangibles" (each as defined under Section 9-102 of the UCC as in
effect in the relevant jurisdiction). We note that DaimlerChrysler Services
North America LLC has given us an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the
Receivables are created under Floorplan Financing Agreements.

          (c) If the transfer of the Receivables [in the Additional Accounts]
and all [of the related] Collateral Security to the Trust pursuant to the Sale
and Servicing Agreement constitutes a true sale of such Receivables and
Collateral Security to the Trust:

               (i) with respect to such Receivables and Collateral Security in
     existence on the date hereof, such sale transfers all of the right,
     title and interest of the Seller in and to such Receivables and
     Collateral Security to the Trust, free and clear of any liens now
     existing or hereafter created, but subject to the rights of the
     Seller as holder of the DCMOT Certificate;

               (ii) with respect to such Receivables and Collateral Security
     which come into existence after the date hereof, upon the creation
     of such Receivables and Collateral Security and the subsequent
     transfer of such Receivables and Collateral Security to the Trust in
     accordance with the Sale and Servicing

<PAGE>


     Agreement and receipt by the Seller of the consideration therefor
     required pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, such sale will
     transfer all of the right, title and interest of the Seller in and to
     such Receivables and Collateral Security to the Trust free and clear of
     any liens, but subject to the rights of the Seller as holder of the DCMOT
     Certificate;

and, in either case, no further action will thereafter be required under
Michigan, Delaware or federal law to protect the Trust's ownership interest in
the Receivables and the Collateral Security against creditors of, or
subsequent purchasers from, the Seller.

          (d) If the transfer of the Receivables and Collateral Security to
the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement does not constitute a
true sale of the Receivables and the Collateral Security to the Trust, then
the Sale and Servicing Agreement as amended and supplemented by the Assignment
creates a valid security interest in favor of the Trust in the Seller's right,
title and interest in and to the Receivables and the Collateral Security and
the proceeds thereof securing the obligations of the Seller thereunder.
Financing statements on form UCC-1 having been filed in the offices of the
Secretaries of State of the States of Michigan and [other applicable states]
and accordingly, such security interest constitutes a perfected security
interest in such Receivables and Collateral Security and the proceeds thereof
subject to no prior liens, enforceable as such against creditors of, and
subsequent purchasers from, the Seller, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to
or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equity principles.

                REASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN REMOVED ACCOUNTS

                         (As required by Section 2.07
                     of the Sale and Servicing Agreement)


          REASSIGNMENT NO. ___ OF RECEIVABLES IN REMOVED ACCOUNTS dated as of
_______________, _____ (this "Reassignment"), by and between DaimlerChrysler
Wholesale Receivables LLC, , a Delaware limited liability company (the
"Seller"), and DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust, Delaware statutory trust
(the "Trust"), pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement referred to below.

                                  WITNESSETH:

          WHEREAS the Seller, DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC, as
servicer (the "Servicer"), and the Trust are parties to a Sale and Servicing
Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended or supplemented, the
"Agreement");

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, the Seller wishes to remove all
Receivables from certain Removed Accounts (the "Removed Accounts") and the
Collateral Security thereof and to cause the Trust to reconvey the Receivables
of such Removed Accounts and such Collateral Security, whether now existing or
hereafter created, from the Trust to the Seller (as each such term is defined
in the Agreement); and

          WHEREAS the Trust is willing to accept such designation and to
reconvey the Receivables in the Removed Accounts and such Collateral Security
subject to the terms and conditions hereof;

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Seller and the Trust hereby agree as follows:

          1. Defined Terms. All terms defined in the Agreement and used herein
shall have such defined meanings when used herein, unless otherwise defined
herein.

          "Removal Commencement Date" shall mean, with respect to the Removal
     Accounts designated hereby, ---------------, -----.

          "Removal Date" shall mean, with respect to the Removed Accounts
     designated hereby, _________________, ______.

          "Removed Accounts" shall mean, the Removed Accounts, as defined in
     the Agreement, that are designated hereby and listed on Schedule 1
     hereto.

          2. Designation of Removed Accounts. The Seller shall deliver to the
Trust and the Trustee, any Enhancement Providers and the Rating Agencies a
computer file or


<PAGE>


microfiche or written list containing a true and complete list of the Removed
Accounts, specifying for each such Account, as of the Removal Commencement
Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in
such Accounts and the Designated Balance. Such list shall be marked as
Schedule 1 to this Reassignment and shall be incorporated into and made a part
of this Reassignment as of the Removal Date and shall amend Schedule 1 to the
Agreement.

          3. Conveyance of Receivables and Accounts. (a) The Trust does hereby
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without
recourse, representation or warranty on and after the Removal Date, all right,
title and interest of the Trust in, to and under all Receivables now existing
at the close of business on the Removal Date and thereafter created from time
to time until the termination of the Trust in Removed Accounts designated
hereby, all Collateral Security thereof, all monies due or to become due and
all amounts received with respect thereto (including all Non-Principal
Receivables) and all proceeds (including Recoveries) thereof.

          (b) If requested by the Seller, in connection with such transfer,
the Trust agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to the Seller on or prior to the date of this Reassignment, a
termination statement with respect to the Receivables existing at the close of
business on the Removal Date and thereafter created from time to time and
Collateral Security thereof in the Removed Accounts reassigned hereby (which
may be a single termination statement with respect to all such Receivables and
Collateral Security) evidencing the release by the Trust or by the Trustee, as
applicable, of its lien on the Receivables in the Removed Accounts and the
Collateral Security, and meeting the requirements of applicable state law, in
such manner and such jurisdictions as are necessary to remove such lien.

          4. Acceptance by the Trust. The Trust hereby acknowledges that,
prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Reassignment, the Seller delivered to the Trust and the Trustee the computer
file or such microfiche or written list described in Section 2 of this
Reassignment.

          5. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Trust as of the date of this Reassignment and
as of the Removal Date:

          (a) Legal, Valid and Binding Obligation. This Reassignment
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
     enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
     effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
     except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of
     equity (whether considered in a suit at law or in equity);

          (b) No Early Redemption Event. The removal of the Accounts hereby
     removed shall not, in the reasonable belief of the Seller, cause an Early
     Redemption Event to occur or cause the Pool Balance to be less than the
     Required Participation Amount;


                                     H-2


<PAGE>

          (c) Selection Procedures. No selection procedures believed by the
     Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or
     any Enhancement Providers were utilized in selecting the Designated
     Accounts [and the selection procedures were applied so as to randomly
     select the Designated Account from the entire population of Accounts];
     and

          (d) True and Complete List. The list of Removed Accounts described
     in Section 2 of this Reassignment is, as of the Removal Commencement
     Date, true and complete in all material respects;

provided, however, that in the event that the removal on such Removal Date
relates solely to Ineligible Accounts, the Seller shall be deemed to make only
the representations and warranties contained in paragraph 5(a) above.

          6. Conditions Precedent. In addition to the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 2.07 of the Agreement, the obligation of the Trust to execute
and deliver this Reassignment is subject to the satisfaction, on or prior to
the Removal Commencement Date, of the following additional condition
precedent:

               Officers' Certificate. The Seller shall have delivered to the
     Trust and the Trustee an Officers' Certificate certifying that (i) as of
     the Removal Commencement Date, all requirements set forth in Section 2.07
     of the Agreement for designating Removed Accounts and reconveying the
     Receivables of such Removed Accounts and the Collateral Security, whether
     existing at the close of business on the Removal Date or thereafter
     created from time to time until the termination of the Trust, have been
     satisfied, and (ii) each of the representations and warranties made by
     the Seller in Section 5 hereof is true and correct as of the date of this
     Reassignment and as of the Removal Commencement Date. The Trustee may
     conclusively rely on such Officers' Certificate, shall have no duty to
     make inquiries with regard to the matters set forth therein and shall
     incur no liability in so relying.

          7. Ratification of Agreement. As supplemented by this Reassignment,
the Agreement is in all respects ratified and confirmed and the Agreement as
so supplemented by this Reassignment shall be read, taken and construed as one
and the same instrument.

                  8. Counterparts. This Reassignment may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of
which shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

          9. GOVERNING LAW. THIS REASSIGNMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF
LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL
BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

          10. Limitation on Liability of the Owner Trustee and Trustee. (a)

any beneficial owner of the Trust have any liability for the representations,

hereto, as to all of which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the
Trust. For all purposes of this Reassignment, in the performance of its duties
or obligations hereunder or in the performance of any duties or obligations of
the Trust hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be subject to, and entitled to
the benefits of, the terms and provisions of Articles V, VI and XI of the
Trust Agreement.

Reassignment has been accepted by The Bank of New York, not in its individual
capacity but solely as Trustee and in no event shall The Bank of New York have
any liability for the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
other obligations of the Trust hereunder or in any of the certificates,

                               SUBORDINATED NOTE

                                                            New York, New York
                                                             December 16, 2004


          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, DaimlerChrysler Wholesale
Receivables LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), hereby
unconditionally promises to pay to the order of DaimlerChrysler Services North
America LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("DCS"), in lawful money of
the United States of America in immediately available funds the principal
amount outstanding on December 16, 2024 (the "Maturity Date"), in respect of
monies borrowed by the Company from time to time to fund the purchase of
Receivables by the Company from DCS pursuant to the Second Amended and
Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Receivables Purchase
Agreement"), between the Company and DCS. The Company may, at its option,
prepay this Subordinated Note in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time from and after the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall
the holder hereof have any right to demand any payment of principal hereunder
prior to the Maturity Date.

          Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the
meanings assigned to them in the Sale and Servicing Agreement dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Sale and
Servicing Agreement"), among the Company, as seller, DCS, as servicer, and
DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust (the "Issuer").

          The undersigned further agrees to pay interest in like money on the
unpaid principal amount hereof from time to time from the date hereof at a
rate per annum equal to [___________________________]. Interest shall be
payable in arrears on each Payment Date commencing on the first such date to
occur after the date hereof and upon final payment of the unpaid principal
amount hereof.

          This Subordinated Note is subordinate and junior in right and time
of payment to all "Senior Debt" of the Company, which is any Indebtedness of
the Company and all renewals, extensions, refinancings and refundings thereof,
except any such Indebtedness that expressly provides that it is not senior or
superior in right of payment hereto. "Indebtedness" is any indebtedness,
whether or not contingent, in respect of borrowed money or evidenced by bonds,
notes, debentures or similar instruments or letters of credit (or
reimbursement agreements in respect thereto) whether any such indebtedness
would appear as a liability upon a balance sheet of the Company prepared on a
consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

          All scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of
Senior Debt must be paid before this Subordinated Note shall be payable, and
all scheduled payments of principal and interest on this Subordinated Note
shall be payable only to the extent that the Company, after


                                     J-1



<PAGE>


paying all of its accounts payable and other current expenses, has the funds
to make such payments. The Company agrees, and the holder hereof by accepting
this Subordinated Note agrees, to the subordination provisions herein
contained. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the
obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be recourse to the Issuer or
any assets thereof pledged under the Amended and Restated Indenture dated as
of December 16, 2004, between the Issuer and The Bank of New York, as
indenture trustee.

          The holder of this Subordinated Note, by its acceptance hereof,
hereby covenants and agrees that it will not at any time institute against the
Company or the Issuer any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency
or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States
federal or state bankruptcy or similar law.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Subordinated Note to
be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

                          Form of Opinion of Counsel

          DCWR has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited
liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
with full power and authority (limited liability company and other) to own its
properties and conduct its business, as presently conducted by it, and to
enter into and perform its obligations under the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement.

          The Designated Affiliate has been duly formed and is validly
existing as a [_______] in good standing under the laws of the State of
[__________], with full power and authority ([_______] and other) to own its
properties and conduct its business, as presently conducted by it and as
proposed to be conducted by it, and to enter into and perform its obligations
under the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and to assume and to perform the
obligations of DCWR under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Related
Documents and the Trust Documents.

          The Designated Affiliate is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing, and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals, in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to qualify or to obtain such licenses or
approvals would render any Receivable unenforceable by the Designated
Affiliate, the Trust or the Trustee on behalf of any Noteholder or other
Secured Party.

          The Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by DCWR, and is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of DCWR enforceable against DCWR in accordance with its terms, except (y) the
enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights, and (z) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

          The Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Designated Affiliate, and the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Related Documents
and the Trust Documents are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Designated Affiliate. The Assignment and Assumption Agreement is enforceable
against the Designated Affiliate in accordance with its terms, except (y) the
enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights, and (z) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

          Neither the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance by DCWR of
DCWR's right, title and interest in the Collateral, the Seller's Interest, the
DCMOT Certificate, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Related Documents and
the Trust Documents or its obligations as


                                     K-5

Seller thereunder to the Designated Affiliate, nor the consummation of any
other transaction contemplated in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, nor
the execution and delivery of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement by DCWR,
will conflict with, or result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or
constitute a default under, any term or provision of the limited liability
company agreement of DCWR or DCS, or of any indenture or other agreement or
instrument to which DCWR or DCS is a party or by which any of them is bound,
or result in a violation of, or contravene the terms of any statute, order or
regulation applicable to DCWR or DCS of any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over any of
them.

          Neither the execution and delivery of the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement by the Designated Affiliate, nor the assumption of the obligations
of DCWR as Seller under the Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Related Documents or the Trust Documents, nor the consummation
of any other transaction contemplated in the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the Amended and Restated
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Related Documents or the Trust Documents
by the Designated Affiliate, will conflict with, or result in a breach,
violation or acceleration of, or constitute a default under, any term or
provision of the [constituent documents] of the Designated Affiliate, or of
any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Designated
Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound, or result in a violation of, or
contravene the terms of any statute, order or regulation applicable to the
Designated Affiliate of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
governmental body having jurisdiction over it.

          There are no actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to
the best of such counsel's knowledge after due inquiry, threatened before any
court, administrative agency, or other tribunal (1) asserting the invalidity
of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (2) seeking to prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement or the execution and delivery thereof, or (3) that might
materially and adversely affect the performance by DCWR or the Designated
Affiliate of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Related Documents or the Trust Documents.

          No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or notice to or
filing with, any court or governmental agency or body is required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, except the filing of amendments to UCC financing statements to
reflect the change of the "Seller" described in such financing statements to
the Designated Affiliate.
