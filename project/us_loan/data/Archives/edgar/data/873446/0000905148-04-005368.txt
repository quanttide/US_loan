      currency risk relating to the Notes; and

                  (iv) any other document necessary or desirable in connection
      with the fulfillment of the purposes of the Trust described in, and
      pursuant to, Section 2.03(a).

restriction on the power and authority of the Beneficiary and the Owner
Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, to execute and deliver other agreements,
documents instruments and securities or to take other actions on behalf of the
Trust in connection with the fulfillment of the purposes of the Trust
described in, and pursuant to, Section 2.03(a).

with its issuance of a series of Notes, such derivative instrument shall be

notional amount at the time of issuance in excess of the principal amount of
such Notes and shall not thereafter be expected to exceed such principal
amount outstanding

Estate will be vested in the Trust as a separate legal entity until this
Agreement terminates pursuant to Article VII; provided, however, that if the
laws of any jurisdiction require that title to any part of the Trust Estate be
vested in the trustees of a trust, then title to that part of the Trust Estate
will be deemed to be vested in the Owner Trustee or any co-trustee or separate
trustee, as the case may be, appointed pursuant to Article VIII.

or New York, and payments will be made by the Trust only from Delaware or New
York. The Trust will be located and administered in the State of Delaware.

            SECTION 2.09. Tax Matters. The parties hereto intend that, for
income and franchise tax purposes, (a) so long as there is a single owner of
the Seller Certificates, the Trust will be treated as a security device and
disregarded as an entity and its assets shall be treated as owned in whole by
the Beneficiary and (b) if there is more than one beneficial owner of the
Seller's Certificates, the Trust shall be treated as a partnership for income
and franchise tax purposes, with (i) the assets of the partnership being the
Receivables and other assets of the Trust, (ii) the partners of the
partnership being the Holders of the Seller's Certificates and (iii) the Notes
issued by the Trust constituting debt of the partnership. The parties hereto
will file all their tax returns in a manner consistent with that intent unless
otherwise required by a taxing authority. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, any tax elections required or permitted to be made by the
Trust under the Code or otherwise will be made by the Beneficiary. The Trust
will not elect to be treated as a corporation for any tax purpose.

the advice of counsel or on any document of any kind, prima facie properly
executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.
DCWR shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any
legal action that shall not be incidental to its obligations under this
Agreement, and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability.
Neither the Beneficiary nor the Holders of any Supplemental Certificates will
be personally liable for the debts or other obligations of the Trust, except
to the extent provided in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

                                 ARTICLE III

            SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Beneficiary.
The Beneficiary hereby represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee as of the
date of this Agreement and as of each date of issuance of Notes under the
Indenture:

            (a) The Beneficiary is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has full limited liability company power, authority and legal right to own
its properties and conduct its business as such properties are presently owned
and such business is presently conducted, and to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) The Beneficiary is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing (or is exempt from such requirement) in any state required in
order to conduct its business, and has obtained all necessary licenses and
approvals with respect to the Beneficiary, in each jurisdiction in which
failure to so qualify or to obtain such licenses and approvals would have a
material adverse effect on the interests of the Noteholders hereunder or under
the Indenture; provided, however, that no representation or warranty is made
with respect to any qualifications, licenses or approvals which the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee has or may be required



                                      10
<PAGE>

at any time to obtain, if any, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or by any Transaction Document to which the Owner Trustee
or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, is a party.

            (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions provided for in this Agreement and in the
Transaction Documents to which the Beneficiary is a party have been duly
authorized by the Beneficiary by all necessary limited liability company
action on its part, and each of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents
to which the Beneficiary is a party will remain, from the time of its
execution, an official record of the Beneficiary. The Beneficiary has the
power and authority to acquire the DCMOT Certificate and to assign the
property to be assigned to and deposited with the Trust pursuant to this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which the Beneficiary is a party.

            (d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of the
terms hereof will not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the
material terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) a material default under, any indenture, contract,
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to which the
Beneficiary is a party or by which it or any of its properties are bound
(other than violations of such indentures, contracts, agreements, mortgages,
deeds of trust or other instruments which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a material adverse effect on the Beneficiary's ability to
perform its obligation under this Agreement).

            (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of the
terms hereof will not conflict with or violate any Requirements of Law
applicable to the Beneficiary.

            (f) There are no proceedings or investigations pending or
threatened against the Beneficiary before any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency, or other tribunal or governmental instrumentality
having jurisdiction over the Beneficiary (i) asserting the invalidity of this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, (ii) seeking to prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of the Transaction Documents, (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that,
in the reasonable judgment of the Beneficiary, would materially and adversely
affect the performance by the Beneficiary of its obligations under this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or (iv) seeking any determination or
ruling that would materially and adversely affect the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                            DISTRIBUTIONS OF FUNDS

            SECTION 4.01. Distribution of Funds.

            (a) All funds received by the Trust to the extent not encumbered
by the Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and otherwise available
for distribution (or, if encumbered by the Indenture or the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, such funds have been



                                      11
<PAGE>

released by the relevant parties benefiting from such encumbrance) will be
distributed to the Holders of the Seller's Certificates as herein provided.

            (b) In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on the
Trust's payment (or allocations of income) to any Holder of the Seller's
Certificates, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to such
Holder in accordance with this Section. The Certificate Paying Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable
hereunder to such Holder sufficient funds for the payment of any withholding
tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but such authorization shall not
prevent the Certificate Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in
appropriate proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding
tax imposed with respect to a Holder shall be treated as cash distributed to
such Holder at the time it is withheld by the Trust and remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax
is payable with respect to a distribution to a non-U.S. Holder, the
Certificate Paying Agent may, at the written direction of the Administrator,
withhold such amounts in accordance with this Section 4.01(b).

            SECTION 4.02. Payments from Trust Estate Only. All payments to be
made on behalf of the Trust under this Agreement will be made only from the
income and the capital proceeds derived from the Trust Estate and only to the
extent that the Trust will have received income or capital proceeds from the
Trust Estate. Each Holder of a Seller's Certificate, by its acceptance of such
Seller's Certificate, agrees that it will look solely to the income and
capital proceeds derived from the Trust Estate (to the extent available for
payment as herein provided) and that, except as specifically provided herein,
the Owner Trustee will not be subject to any liability in its individual
capacity under this Agreement to the Holders of the Seller's Certificates or
to any other Person.

            SECTION 4.03. Method of Payment. Subject to Section 7.01(c),
distributions required to be made hereby to the Holders of such Seller's
Certificates out of the funds released to the Trust in accordance with the
Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements
shall be made by the Certificate Paying Agent to each Holder of record on the
related Record Date by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the
account of such Holder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities
therefor, if such Holder shall have provided to the Certificate Registrar
appropriate written instructions at least five Business Days prior to such
distribution date, or, if not, by check mailed to such Holder at the address
of such Holder appearing in the Certificate Register.

            SECTION 4.04. Establishment of Account. The Beneficiary hereby
authorizes the Owner Trustee to establish with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or
if the Owner Trustee is not Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National Association,
such other bank as the Owner Trustee shall select) and maintain on behalf of
the Trust an account into which all funds received by the Owner Trustee on
behalf of the Trust shall be deposited. Such account shall be designated the
"Beneficiary Trust Account".

                                  ARTICLE V

                          DUTIES OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE

            SECTION 5.01. Action Upon Instructions.

            (a) It is the intention of the Beneficiary that the powers and
duties of the Owner Trustee are to be purely ministerial only, and that the
Beneficiary will have the power to direct the Owner Trustee as to all
nonministerial matters concerning the administration of the Trust (to the
extent such matters are within the powers of the Beneficiary). Accordingly,
subject to Sections 5.01(b) and 5.01(c), and Article XII, the Beneficiary will
direct the Owner Trustee in the management of the Trust and the Trust Estate.
Such direction shall be exercised at any time only by written instruction of
the Beneficiary delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant to this Article V.

            (b) The Owner Trustee will take such action or actions as may be
specified in any instructions delivered in accordance with Section 5.01(a);
provided, however, that the Owner Trustee will not be required to take any
such action if the Trustee Bank has been advised by counsel that such action
(i) is contrary to the terms hereof or of any document contemplated hereby to
which the Trust or the Owner Trustee is a party or is otherwise contrary to
law, or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in liability on the part of the
Trustee Bank, unless the Trustee Bank will have received from the Beneficiary
additional indemnification or security satisfactory to the Trustee Bank
against all costs, expenses and liabilities arising from the Owner Trustee's
taking such action.

            (c) The Beneficiary will not direct the Owner Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action that is not authorized or permitted by this
Agreement or is contrary to this Agreement, nor will the Owner Trustee be
obligated to follow any such direction.

            (d) In the event that the Owner Trustee is unsure as to the
application of any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or
such provision is ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or this Agreement permits any
determination by the Owner Trustee or is silent or is incomplete as to the
course of action to be adopted, the Owner Trustee will promptly give notice to
the Beneficiary requesting written instructions as to the course of action to
be adopted and, to the extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith in
accordance with such written instructions received from the Beneficiary, the
Owner Trustee shall not be liable on account of such action to any Person. If
the Owner Trustee will not have received appropriate written instructions
within 30 days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as
reasonably may be specified in such notice) it may, but shall be under no duty
to, take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this
Agreement, as it deems to be in the best interests of the Beneficiary, and
will have no liability to any Person for such action or inaction.

            (e) The Owner Trustee will, subject to this Section 5.01, act in
accordance with the instructions given to it by the Beneficiary pursuant to
Section 5.01(a), and to the extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith in
accordance with such instructions, the Owner Trustee will not be liable on
account of such action to any Person.



                                      13
<PAGE>

            (f) The Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged its
duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the Transaction Documents to
the extent the Administrator has agreed in the Administration Agreement to
perform any act or to discharge any duty of the Owner Trustee hereunder or
under any Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be held liable
for the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out its obligations
under the Administration Agreement.

            SECTION 5.02. No Duty to Act Under Certain Circumstances.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Trustee
Bank nor the Owner Trustee, except a Trustee Bank authorized as co-trustee,
will be required to take any action in any jurisdiction other than in the
State of Delaware if the taking of such action would (i) require the consent
or approval or authorization or order of or the giving of notice to, or the
registration with or taking of any action in respect of, any state or other
governmental authority or agency of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware; (ii) result in any fee, tax or governmental charge under the laws of
any jurisdiction or any political subdivisions thereof in existence on the
date hereof other than the State of Delaware becoming payable by the Trustee
Bank; or (iii) subject the Trustee Bank to personal jurisdiction in any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware for causes of action arising
from acts unrelated to the consummation of the transactions by the Trustee
Bank or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, contemplated hereby. The Owner
Trustee shall be entitled to obtain advice of counsel (which advice shall be
at the expense of the Beneficiary) to determine whether any action required to
be taken pursuant to the Agreement results in the consequences described in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence. In the event that said
counsel advises the Owner Trustee that such action will result in such
consequences, the Owner Trustee may, or if instructed to do so by the
Beneficiary, shall, appoint an additional trustee pursuant to Section 8.04 to
proceed with such action.

            SECTION 5.03. No Duties Except Under Specified Agreements or
Instructions.

            (a) The Owner Trustee will not have any duty or obligation to
manage, control, use, make any payment in respect of, register, record,
insure, inspect, sell, dispose of, create, maintain or perfect any security
interest or title in or otherwise deal with any part of the Trust Estate,
prepare, file or record any document or report (including any tax related
filing for any holder of Notes), or to otherwise take or refrain from taking
any action under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Trust or any
document contemplated hereby to which the Trust or the Owner Trustee is a
party, except as expressly provided by the terms of this Agreement or in
written instructions from the Beneficiary received pursuant to Section 5.01;
and no implied duties or obligations will be read into this Agreement against
the Owner Trustee. Unless otherwise directed by the Beneficiary in accordance
with Section 5.01(a), the Owner Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to
take any action the Trust is authorized and empowered to take pursuant to
Section 2.03(a). The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will, in its
individual capacity and at its own cost and expense, promptly take all action
as may be necessary to discharge any lien, pledge, security interest or other
encumbrance on any part of the Trust Estate which results from actions by or
claims against the Trustee Bank not related to the ownership of any part of
the Trust Estate.

            (b) The Owner Trustee agrees that it will not manage, control,
use, lease, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with any part of the Trust
Estate except (i) in accordance with the



                                      14
<PAGE>

powers granted to, or the authority conferred upon, the Owner Trustee pursuant
to this Trust Agreement, or (ii) in accordance with the express terms hereof
or with written instructions from the Beneficiary pursuant to Section 5.01.
Unless otherwise directed by the Beneficiary in accordance with Section
5.01(a), the Owner Trustee shall not be required to perform any obligations or
duties of the Trust under the Indenture, which duties and obligations shall be
the sole responsibility of the Beneficiary or the Administrator, as the case
may be.

            SECTION 5.04. Trust Operation. The operations of the Trust will be
conducted in accordance with the following standards:

            (a) the Trust will act solely in its own name through the Owner
Trustee (or the Administrator on its behalf) or the Beneficiary;

            (b) the Trust will not incur any indebtedness for money borrowed
or incur any obligations except in connection with the purposes set forth in
Section 2.03 of this Agreement;

            (c) the Trust's funds and assets will at all times be maintained
separately from those of the Beneficiary and its Affiliates;

            (d) the Trust will take all reasonable steps to continue its
identity as a separate legal entity and to make it apparent to third persons
that it is an entity with assets and liabilities distinct from those of the
Beneficiary, the Beneficiary's Affiliates or any other third person, and will
use stationery and other business forms of the Owner Trustee or the Trust and
not that of the Beneficiary or any of its Affiliates, and will use its best
efforts to avoid the appearance (i) of conducting business on behalf of the
Beneficiary or any Affiliates thereof, or (ii) that the assets of the Trust
are available to pay the creditors of the Beneficiary or any Affiliates
thereof;

            (e) the Trust will not hold itself out as being liable for the
debts of the Beneficiary or any Affiliates thereof;

            (f) the Trust will not engage in any transaction with the
Beneficiary or any Affiliates thereof, except as required, or specifically
permitted, by this Agreement or unless such transaction is otherwise on terms
neither more favorable nor less favorable than the terms and conditions
available at the time to the Trust for comparable transactions with other
Persons; and

            (g) the Trust will not enter into any voluntary bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding without a finding by the Owner Trustee that the Trust's
liabilities exceeds its assets or that the Trust is unable to pay its debts in
a timely manner as they become due.

            SECTION 5.05. Execution of Documents. The Owner Trustee will, at
the written direction of the Beneficiary, execute and deliver on behalf of the
Trust such instruments, agreements and certificates contemplated hereby to
which the Trust is or is to be a party. Absent such written direction, the
Owner Trustee shall have no duty or obligation to execute or deliver any
instruments, agreements or certificates on behalf of the Trust, all of which
shall be executed and delivered by the Beneficiary on behalf of the Trust
(other than those executed and delivered pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 5.05).

<PAGE>

            SECTION 5.06. Nonpetition Covenants. Notwithstanding any prior
termination of the Trust or this Agreement, the Owner Trustee, the Beneficiary
and, by its acceptance of a Seller's Certificate, each Holder thereof
covenants and agrees that it shall not at any time with respect to the Trust
acquiesce, petition or otherwise invoke or cause the Trust to invoke the
process of any court or government authority for the purpose of commencing or
sustaining a case against the Trust under any Federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar law or appointing a receiver, conservator, liquidator,
assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the
Trust or any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the affairs of the Trust; provided, however, that this Section
5.06 shall not preclude any remedy described in Article VII of the Indenture.

                                  ARTICLE VI

                          CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE BANK

            SECTION 6.01. Acceptance of Trust and Duties. The Trustee Bank
accepts the trust hereby created and agrees to perform the same but only upon
the terms of this Agreement. If, notwithstanding Section 4.03, the Trustee
Bank receives moneys constituting part of the Trust Estate, the Trustee Bank
agrees to disburse all such moneys in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Trustee Bank will not be answerable or accountable under any
circumstances in its individual capacity, except (i) for its own willful
misconduct, bad faith or negligence, (ii) in the case of the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 6.07, (iii) for the failure by
the Owner Trustee to perform obligations expressly undertaken by it in the
last sentence of Section 5.03(a), or (iv) for taxes, fees or other charges on,
based on or measured by, any fees, commissions or other compensation earned by
the Trustee Bank for acting as trustee hereunder. In particular, but not by
way of limitation:

            (a) the Trustee Bank will not be personally liable for any error
of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee
so long as the same will not constitute negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct;

            (b) the Trustee Bank will not be personally liable with respect to
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Owner Trustee in good faith in
accordance with the instructions of the Beneficiary;

            (c) no provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
will require the Trustee Bank to expend or risk its personal funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its
rights or powers hereunder, if the Trustee Bank will have reasonable grounds
for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
risk or liability is not reasonably assured or provided to it, including such
advances as the Trustee Bank may reasonably request;

            (d) under no circumstance will the Trustee Bank be personally
liable for the accuracy or performance of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other obligation of the Trust, including any
indebtedness of the Trust;



                                      16
<PAGE>

            (e) the Trustee Bank will not be personally responsible or liable
for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or for the
due execution hereof by the Beneficiary or with respect to any agreement
entered into by the Trust;

            (f) under no circumstances will the Trustee Bank be responsible or
liable for the action or inaction of the Beneficiary, nor will the Trustee
Bank be responsible for monitoring the performance of the Beneficiary's duties
hereunder or of any other Person acting for or on behalf of the Trust;

            (g) in no event shall the Trustee Bank be personally liable for
special, consequential or punitive damages unless such damages result from its
willful misconduct or gross negligence, for the acts or omissions of its
nominees, correspondents, clearing agencies or securities depositories, for
the acts or omissions of brokers or dealers, and for any losses due to forces
beyond the control of the Trustee Bank, including strikes, work stoppages,
acts of war or terrorism, insurrection, revolution, nuclear or natural
catastrophes or acts of God and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of
utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services. The
Trustee Bank shall have no responsibility for the accuracy of any information
provided to the Beneficiary or any other Person that has been obtained from,
or provided to the Trustee Bank by, any other Person;

            (h) the Trustee Bank shall not be liable for the default or
misconduct of the Indenture Trustee under any of the Transaction Documents or
otherwise, and the Trustee Bank shall have no obligation or liability to
perform the obligations of the Trust under this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents, in each case that are required to be performed by the Indenture
Trustee under the Indenture; and

            (i) the Trustee Bank shall be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers vested in it by this agreement, or to institute,
conduct or defend any litigation under this Agreement or otherwise or in
relation to this Agreement or any Transaction Document, at the request, order
or direction of the Beneficiary, unless the Beneficiary has offered to the
Trustee Bank security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by the Trustee Bank therein or
thereby. The right of the Trustee Bank to perform any discretionary act
enumerated in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document shall not be
construed as a duty, and the Trustee Bank shall not be answerable for other
than its negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of any such act.

            SECTION 6.02. Furnishing of Documents. The Owner Trustee will
furnish to the Beneficiary, within a reasonable time under the circumstances
after receipt thereof, duplicates or copies of all reports, notices, requests,
demands, certificates, financial statements and any other instruments
furnished to the Owner Trustee with respect to the Trust or the Trust Estate
that are not, pursuant to this Agreement, any Transaction Document or
otherwise, required to be forwarded directly by another Person to the
Beneficiary.

            SECTION 6.03. Representations and Warranties as to the Trust
Estate. The Owner Trustee makes no representation or warranty as to, and shall
not be liable for, the title, value, condition, design, operation,
merchantability or fitness for use of the Trust Estate (or any



                                      17
<PAGE>

part thereof) or any other representation or warranty, express or implied,
whatsoever with respect to the Trust Estate (or any part thereof).

            SECTION 6.04. Signature of Periodic Filings. The Beneficiary, as
attorney-in-fact for the Owner Trustee, will sign on behalf of the Trust any
Periodic Filings of the Trust or other documents relating to the Trust
prepared by, or on behalf of, the Beneficiary or the Administrator.

            SECTION 6.05. Reliance; Advice of Counsel. The Owner Trustee will
incur no liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, notice,
resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or
other document or paper believed by it to be genuine and believed by it to be
signed by the proper party or parties. The Owner Trustee may accept a
certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors or other governing
body of any entity as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly
adopted by such body and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any
fact or matter the manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically
prescribed herein, the Owner Trustee may for all purposes rely on an officer's
certificate of the relevant party, as to such fact or matter, and such
officer's certificate will constitute full protection to the Owner Trustee for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance
thereon. In the administration of the Trust, the Owner Trustee may, at the
expense of the Trust, (i) execute the trust or any of the powers hereof and
perform its powers and duties hereunder directly or through agents or
attorneys, and the Owner Trustee will not be liable for the default or
misconduct of any agent or attorney selected by the Owner Trustee with
reasonable care; and (ii) consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled
persons to be selected with reasonable care and employed by it, and the Owner
Trustee will not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel,
accountants or other skilled persons.

            SECTION 6.06. Not Acting in Individual Capacity. Except as
provided in this Article VI, in accepting the trust hereby created the Trustee
Bank acts solely as Owner Trustee hereunder and not in its individual
capacity; and all Persons having any claim against the Trust or the Owner
Trustee, whether by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise, will look only to the Trust Estate (or a part thereof, as the
case may be) for payment or satisfaction thereof, except as specifically
provided in this Article VI.

            SECTION 6.07. Representations and Warranties. The Trustee Bank,
other than a Trustee Bank appointed as a co-trustee, hereby represents and
warrants to the Beneficiary that:

            (a) The Trustee Bank is a national banking association duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the United
States. The Trustee Bank has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) The Trustee Bank has taken all corporate action necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by it of this Agreement, and this
Agreement will be executed and delivered by one of its officers who is duly
authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement on its behalf.



                                      18
<PAGE>

            (c) Neither the execution nor the delivery by it of this
Agreement, nor the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
nor compliance by the Trustee Bank with any of the terms or provisions hereof
will contravene any federal or Delaware law, governmental rule or regulation
governing the banking or trust powers of the Trustee Bank or any judgment or
order binding on the Trustee Bank, or constitute any default under its charter
documents or by-laws or any indenture, mortgage, contract, agreement or
instrument to which the Trustee Bank is a party or by which any of the Trustee
Bank's properties may be bound.

            (d) The Trustee Bank complies with all of the requirements of
Chapter 38, Title 12 of the Delaware Code relating to the qualification of a
trustee of a Delaware statutory trust.

                                 ARTICLE VII

                        TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT

            SECTION 7.01. Termination of Trust Agreement.

            (a) The Trust shall dissolve upon the final distribution by the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee of all moneys or other property or
proceeds of the Trust Estate in accordance with the Delaware Statutory Trust
Act and the terms of the Indenture, the Sale and Servicing Agreement and
Article V hereof. The bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, termination, death
or incapacity of any Holder of a Seller's Certificate shall not (x) operate to
terminate this Agreement or the Trust, or (y) entitle such Holder's legal
representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or
proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of all or any part of
the Trust or Trust Estate or (z) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and
liabilities of the parties hereto.

            (b) Except as provided in Section 7.01(a), the Holders of the
Seller's Certificates shall not be entitled to revoke or terminate the Trust.

            (c) Notice of any dissolution of the Trust, specifying the date
upon which Holders of the Seller's Certificates shall surrender their Seller's
Certificates to the Certificate Paying Agent for payment of the final
distribution and cancellation, shall be given by the Owner Trustee by letter
to the Holders mailed within five Business Days after the Owner Trustee
obtains written notice from the Servicer of the final distribution of the
Trust Estate referred to in Section 7.01(a), stating (i) the date upon or with
respect to which final payment of the Seller's Certificates shall be made upon
presentation and surrender of the Seller's Certificates at the office of the
Certificate Paying Agent therein designated, (ii) the amount of any such final
payment and (iii) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such final date
of distribution is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation
and surrender of the Seller's Certificates at the office of the Certificate
Paying Agent therein specified. The Owner Trustee shall give such notice to
the Certificate Registrar (if other than the Owner Trustee) and the
Certificate Paying Agent at the time such notice is given to the Holders. Upon
presentation and surrender of the Seller's Certificates, the Certificate
Paying Agent shall cause to be distributed to the Holders amounts
distributable on such date pursuant to Section 4.01.



                                      19
<PAGE>

            In the event that all of the Holders shall not surrender their
Seller's Certificates for cancellation within six months after the date
specified in the above mentioned written notice, the Owner Trustee, at the
written request of the Certificate Paying Agent shall give a second written
notice to the remaining Holders to surrender their Seller's Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If
within one year after the second notice all the Seller's Certificates shall
not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Owner Trustee may take
appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to
contact the remaining Holders concerning surrender of their Seller's
Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other
assets that shall remain subject to this Agreement. Subject to applicable
escheat laws, any funds remaining in the Trust after exhaustion of such
remedies shall be distributed by the Certificate Paying Agent to the
Beneficiary.

            (d) In winding up the Trust, the Owner Trustee shall, upon the
release of the lien of the Indenture on the Trust Estate and the presentment
and surrender of the Seller's Certificates to the Certificate Paying Agent for
final distribution and cancellation, assign and convey to the Beneficiary or
its designee, without recourse, representation or warranty, all right, title
and interest of the Trust in and to the Trust Assets, whether then existing or
thereafter created, and all proceeds thereof, except for amounts held in trust
by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 1103 of the Indenture. The Owner
Trustee, at the expense and direction of the Beneficiary, shall execute and
deliver such instruments of transfer and assignment, in each case without
recourse, representation or warranty, as shall be prepared by the Beneficiary
for execution by the Owner Trustee which are reasonably requested by the
Beneficiary to vest in the Beneficiary all right, title and interest which the
Trust had in the Trust Estate.

            (e) Upon the completion of winding up of the Trust in accordance
with Section 3808 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Owner Trustee
shall, at the written direction and expense of the Beneficiary, cause the
Certificate of Trust to be canceled by filing a certificate of cancellation
with the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of Section 3810
of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and thereupon the Trust and this Agreement
(other than Article XI) shall terminate.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                   SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEES, CO-TRUSTEES AND
                            SEPARATE OWNER TRUSTEES

            SECTION 8.01. Resignation and Removal of the Owner Trustee;
Appointment of Successors. Upon the occurrence of a Disqualification Event
with respect to the Owner Trustee, the Beneficiary may appoint a successor
Owner Trustee by an instrument signed by the Beneficiary. If a successor Owner
Trustee has not been appointed within 30 days after the giving of written
notice of such resignation or the delivery of the written instrument with
respect to such removal, the Owner Trustee or the Beneficiary may apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Owner Trustee to act
until such time, if any, as a successor Owner Trustee has been appointed as
above provided. Any successor Owner Trustee so appointed by such court will
immediately and without further act be superseded by any successor Owner
Trustee appointed as above provided within one year from the date of the
appointment by such court. The Owner Trustee may resign at any time without
cause by giving at least 30 days'



                                      20
<PAGE>

prior written notice to the Beneficiary. In addition, the Beneficiary may at
any time remove the Owner Trustee without cause by an instrument in writing
delivered to the Owner Trustee. No such removal or resignation shall become
effective until a successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, becomes vested
as Owner Trustee hereunder pursuant to Section 8.02. The Beneficiary will
notify the Note Rating Agencies promptly after the resignation or removal of
the Owner Trustee and promptly after the appointment of a successor Owner
Trustee.

            SECTION 8.02. Transfer Procedures. Any successor Owner Trustee,
however appointed, will execute and deliver to the predecessor Owner Trustee
an instrument accepting such appointment, and such other documents of transfer
as may be necessary, and thereupon such successor Owner Trustee, without
further act, will become vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, duties and trusts of the predecessor Owner Trustee in the trust
hereunder with like effect as if originally named an Owner Trustee herein and
the predecessor Owner Trustee will be fully discharged of its duties and
obligations to serve as Owner Trustee hereunder. The predecessor Owner Trustee
shall promptly deliver to the successor Owner Trustee all documents,
statements and monies held by it under this Agreement. The successor Owner
Trustee shall promptly file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the
Secretary of State identifying the name and principal place of business of
such successor Owner Trustee in the State of Delaware.

            SECTION 8.03. Qualification of Owner Trustee. Any Owner Trustee
will at all times (i) be a trust company or a banking corporation under the
laws of its state of incorporation or a national banking association, having
all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on a trust business in the State of
Delaware, (ii) comply with Section 3807 (and any other applicable Section) of
the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, (iii) have a combined capital and surplus of
not less than $50,000,000 (or have its obligations and liabilities irrevocably
and unconditionally guaranteed by an affiliated Person having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000) and (iv) have (or have a parent
which has) a rating of at least Baa3 by Moody's, at least BBB- by Standard &
Poor's or, if not rated, otherwise satisfactory to each Note Rating Agency.

            SECTION 8.04. Co-trustees and Separate Owner Trustees. Whenever
the Owner Trustee or the Beneficiary shall deem it necessary or prudent in
order either to conform to any law of any jurisdiction in which all or any
part of the Trust Estate shall be situated or to make any claim or bring any
suit with respect to the Trust Estate, or whenever the Owner Trustee or the
Beneficiary shall be advised by counsel satisfactory to them that such action
is necessary or prudent, the Owner Trustee and the Beneficiary shall execute
and deliver an agreement supplemental hereto and all other instruments and
agreements, and shall take all other actions, necessary or proper to appoint
one or more Persons either as co-trustee or co-trustees jointly with the Owner
Trustee of all or any part of the Trust Estate, or as a separate trustee or
separate trustees of all or any part of the Trust Estate, and to vest in such
Persons, in such capacity, such title to the Trust Estate or any part thereof,
and such rights or duties, as may be necessary or desirable, all for such
period and under such terms and conditions as are satisfactory to the Owner
Trustee and the Beneficiary. In case a Disqualification Event shall occur with
respect to any such co-trustee or separate trustee, the title to the Trust
Estate and all rights and duties of such co-trustee or separate trustee shall,
so far as permitted by law, vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee,
without the appointment of a successor to such co-trustee or separate trustee.

            SECTION 8.05. Merger or Consolidation of Owner Trustee. Any
corporation into which the Owner Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or
any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Owner Trustee, shall be the successor of the Owner Trustee
hereunder, without the execution or filing of any instrument or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided that such corporation shall be eligible pursuant to
Section 8.03 and, provided, further, that the Owner Trustee shall mail notice
of such merger or consolidation to the Note Rating Agencies.

                                  ARTICLE IX

                                  AMENDMENTS

            SECTION 9.01. Amendments.

            (a) This Agreement may be amended from time to time, by a written
instrument executed by the Owner Trustee, at the written direction of the
Beneficiary, and the Beneficiary, without the consent of the Indenture Trustee
or any Noteholders, upon issuance of an Issuer Tax Opinion, which shall not be
expenses of the Owner Trustee or the Trustee Bank; provided, however, that (i)
the Trust shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee an
Officer's Certificate (as defined in the Indenture) to the effect that the
Trust reasonably believes that such amendment will not have an Adverse Effect
(as defined in the Indenture) and is not reasonably expected to have an
Adverse Effect at any time in the future and (ii) the Indenture Trustee shall
have received written confirmation from each Note Rating Agency that such
amendment will not have a Ratings Effect.

            (b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time, by a
written instrument executed by the Owner Trustee, at the written direction of
the Beneficiary, and the Beneficiary, with prior written notice to each Note
Rating Agency, with the consent of the Indenture Trustee, the consent of not
less than 66 2/3% in Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount (as defined in the
Indenture) of the Notes affected by such amendment, and upon issuance of an
Issuer Tax Opinion; provided, however, that, without the consent of the
Noteholders of all of the Notes then outstanding, no such amendment shall (a)
increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the
timing of, collections of payments in respect of the Receivables or
distributions that are required to be made for the benefit of the Noteholders
or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of the Notes, the Noteholders of which are required to consent to any
such amendment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any
amendment to be effected pursuant to this Section 9.01(b) without the consent
of each adversely affected Noteholder shall be subject to the Indenture
Trustee's receipt of written confirmation from each applicable Note Rating
Agency that such amendment will not have a Ratings Effect with respect to the
adversely affected Notes.

            (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 9.01 to the
contrary, no amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely
affect in any material respect the interests of any Holders of the Seller's
Certificates without the consent of the Holders of Seller's Certificates
evidencing not less than a majority of the Percentage Interests of the


                                      22
<PAGE>

outstanding Seller's Certificates; provided, however, that, without the
consent of the Holders of all of the Seller's Certificates then outstanding,
no such amendment shall (x) increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or
accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of payments in respect of the
Receivables or distributions that are required to be made for the benefit of
the Holders of the Seller's Certificates or (y) reduce the aforesaid
Percentage Interests of the outstanding Seller's Certificates, the Holders of
which are required to consent to any such amendment.

            (d) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent,
the Trust shall furnish written notification of the substance of such
amendment or consent to the Indenture Trustee and, if applicable, each Note
Rating Agency.

            (e) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Noteholders
or the Holders of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to this Section 9.01 to
approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it shall
be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

            (f) Promptly after the execution of any amendment to the
Certificate of Trust, the Owner Trustee shall cause the filing of such
amendment with the Secretary of State.

            (g) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the
Certificate of Trust or any Transaction Document to which the Trust is a
party, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully
protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and such other
Transaction Documents, and all conditions precedent in this Agreement and such
other Transaction Documents to the execution and delivery of such amendment
have been satisfied. The Owner Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to,
enter into any such amendment which affects the Owner Trustee's own rights,
duties or immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.

                                  ARTICLE X

                           THE SELLER'S CERTIFICATES

            SECTION 10.01. Initial Beneficiary of Trust. Upon the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance of the DCMOT Certificate to
DCWR on the Effective Date as hereinafter provided, DCWR shall continue to be
the Beneficiary of the Trust, and the "Ownership Interest" (under and as
defined in the Existing Trust Agreement) previously held by DCWR shall be
deemed cancelled and terminated.

            SECTION 10.02. The Seller's Certificates.

            (a) The DCMOT Certificate, together with any outstanding
Supplemental Certificates issued pursuant to Section 10.10, shall represent
the entire beneficial interest in the Trust Estate, subject to lien of the
Indenture and the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. The DCMOT
Certificate and any outstanding Supplemental Certificates shall each be a
Seller's Certificate entitling the Holder thereof to receive, to the extent
provided herein, such Seller's Certificate's Percentage Interest in the
distributions in respect of the Seller's



                                      23
<PAGE>

Interest. From the Effective Date until the issuance of any Supplemental
Certificates pursuant to Section 10.10, the DCMOT Certificate shall be the
sole Seller's Certificate.

            (b) Each Seller's Certificate shall be issued in definitive, fully
registered form. The DCMOT Certificate shall be substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B, and any Supplemental Certificate shall be
substantially in the form provided in the related Supplemental Certificate
Amendment. Each Seller's Certificate shall be executed on behalf of the Trust
by manual or facsimile signature of an authorized officer or assistant officer
of the Owner Trustee. Any Seller's Certificate bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of an individual who was, at the time when such signature was
affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Owner Trustee, shall not be
rendered invalid, notwithstanding that such individual ceased to be so
authorized prior to the delivery of such Seller's Certificate or does not hold
such office at the date of such Seller's Certificate.

            SECTION 10.03. Authentication of Seller's Certificates. On the
Effective Date, the Owner Trustee is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of
the Trust the DCMOT Certificate registered in the name of DCWR and is hereby
authorized to authenticate and deliver the initial DCMOT Certificate on such
date to DCWR without any corporate action by DCWR, or any action by any other
Person, being required. Any Seller's Certificate (including any Supplemental
Certificate) issued after the Effective Date shall be authenticated and
delivered by the Certificate Registrar upon the written order of the
Beneficiary signed by its chairman of the board, its president, any vice
president, its secretary, any assistant secretary or any authorized signatory.
No Seller's Certificate shall entitle the Holder thereof to any benefit under
this Agreement or be valid for any purpose unless there shall appear on such
Seller's Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form
set forth in Exhibit B (in the case of the DCMOT Certificate) and in the form
provided in the Supplemental Certificate Amendment (in the case of a
Supplemental Certificate), in each case, executed by the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar, as the case may be, by manual signature. Such
authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that the Seller's
Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and
validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement. Each Seller's
Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication.

            SECTION 10.04. Registration of Seller's Certificates; Limitations
on Transfer.

            (a) The Certificate Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept, at
the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 10.06, a Certificate
Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
the Trust shall provide for the registration of the Seller's Certificates and,
to the extent permitted by this Agreement, of transfers and exchanges of the
Seller's Certificates. The Trust hereby appoints BNY as the initial
Certificate Registrar. Unless the context requires otherwise, any reference in
this Agreement to the Certificate Registrar shall include any co-certificate
registrar appointed by the Certificate Registrar and acceptable to the
Administrator.

            Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Seller's
Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 10.06, the
Owner Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust and the Certificate
Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the



                                      24
<PAGE>

designated transferee or transferees, a single, new Seller's Certificate dated
the date of authentication by the Certificate Registrar.

            Every Seller's Certificate presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer shall be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar duly executed by the Holder of such Seller's Certificate or such
other Person duly authorized in writing. Each Seller's Certificate surrendered
for registration of transfer shall be cancelled and subsequently disposed of
by the Certificate Registrar in accordance with its customary practice.

            No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange of the Seller's Certificates, but the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or
exchange of the Seller's Certificates.

            The preceding provisions of this Section notwithstanding, the
Trust shall not make, and the Certificate Registrar shall not register
transfers or exchanges of, any Seller's Certificate for a period of 15 days
preceding the due date for any payment with respect to such Seller's
Certificate.

            (b) The Holder of the DCMOT Certificate shall not sell,
participate, transfer, assign or otherwise pledge or convey all or any part of
its right, title and interest in the DCMOT Certificate, except in accordance
with Sections 10.10 and 10.11. Any purported transfer by the Holder of the
DCMOT Certificate of all or any part of its right, title and interest in and
to the DCMOT Certificate not in compliance with the terms of Sections 10.10
and 10.11 shall be null and void.

            (c) The Holder of a Supplemental Certificate shall not sell,
participate, transfer, assign or otherwise pledge or convey all or any part of
its right, title and interest in such Supplemental Certificate, except in
accordance with Section 10.10. Any purported transfer by the Holder of a
Supplemental Certificate of all or any part of its right, title and interest
in and to such Supplemental Certificate not in compliance with the terms of
Section 10.10 shall be null and void.

            SECTION 10.05. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Seller's
Certificates. If (i) a mutilated Seller's Certificate shall be surrendered to
the Certificate Registrar, or if the Certificate Registrar shall receive
evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of a Seller's
Certificate and (ii) there shall be delivered to the Owner Trustee such
security or indemnity as may be required by the Owner Trustee to hold it
harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Seller's Certificate has
been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Trust shall execute and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of the mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Seller's Certificate, a new Seller's Certificate of like tenor and
Percentage Interest. In connection with the issuance of the new Seller's
Certificate under this Section, the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any
duplicate Seller's Certificate issued pursuant to



                                      25
<PAGE>

this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of ownership in the Trust,
as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Seller's
Certificate shall be found at any time.

            SECTION 10.06. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Trust shall
maintain an office or agency where the Seller's Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and
demands to or upon the Trust in respect of the Seller's Certificates, this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents may be served. The Trust hereby
designates the Certificate Registrar, initially located at 101 Barclay Street,
New York, New York 10286, as its office for such purposes. The Certificate
Registrar shall give prompt written notice to the Trust, the Owner Trustee,
the Administrator and the Holders of the Seller's Certificates of any change
in the location of the Certificate Register or any such office or agency.

            SECTION 10.07. Persons Deemed Holders. The Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Certificate Paying Agent and the
Administrator shall treat the Person in whose name each Seller's Certificate
is registered in the Certificate Register as the owner of such Seller's
Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Section
5.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Trust, the
Beneficiary, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Certificate
Paying Agent or the Administrator shall be bound by any notice to the
contrary.

            SECTION 10.08. Holders' Names and Addresses. The Certificate
Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Beneficiary, the Owner
Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent, within 15 days
after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a written request therefor from
any such party, a list, in such form as such Person may reasonably require, of
the names and addresses of the Holders of the Seller's Certificates as of a
recent date. If the Holder of a Supplemental Certificate applies in writing to
the Certificate Registrar, and such application states that the applicant
desires to communicate with other Holders of Supplemental Certificates with
respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Supplemental
Certificates, then the Certificate Registrar shall, within five Business Days
after the receipt of such application, afford such applicant access during
normal business hours to the current list of the Holders of the Supplemental
Certificates. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Seller's Certificate,
shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Certificate Registrar,
the Beneficiary, the Owner Trustee, the Administrator or the Certificate
Paying Agent accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address,
regardless of the source from which such information was derived.

            SECTION 10.09. Appointment of Certificate Paying Agent. The
Certificate Paying Agent shall make distributions to the Holders of the
Seller's Certificates in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and the
Administrator. The Administrator, on behalf of the Trust, may remove the
Certificate Paying Agent if the Administrator determines in its sole
discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The Certificate
Paying Agent initially shall be BNY. At any time, the Certificate Paying Agent
may include any other co-paying agent chosen by the Administrator and
acceptable to the Owner Trustee. No Certificate Paying Agent shall be
permitted to resign as Certificate Paying Agent without 30 day's prior written
notice to the Administrator and the Owner Trustee. In the event that BNY shall
no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent, the



                                      26
<PAGE>

Administrator, on behalf of the Trust, shall appoint a successor to act as
Certificate Paying Agent (which successor shall be a bank or trust company).
Such successor Certificate Paying Agent shall execute and deliver to the Owner
Trustee an instrument in which such successor Certificate Paying Agent shall
agree with the Trust and the Owner Trustee that, as Certificate Paying Agent,
such successor Certificate Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it
for payment to the Holders of the Seller's Certificates in trust for the
benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to the
Holders of the Seller's Certificates. The resigning Certificate Paying Agent
shall return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and, upon removal of a
Certificate Paying Agent, such Certificate Paying Agent shall also return all
funds in its possession to the Owner Trustee. Any reference in this Agreement
to the Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the
context requires otherwise.

            SECTION 10.10. Partial Transfer of the DCMOT Certificate; Issuance
and Transfer of Supplemental Certificates.

            (a) The Beneficiary, as Holder of the DCMOT Certificate, may
surrender the DCMOT Certificate to the Owner Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar in exchange for a newly issued DCMOT Certificate and one or more
additional certificates (each such additional certificate, a "Supplemental
Certificate") to be delivered to or upon the order of the Beneficiary. The
terms of any Supplemental Certificate shall be defined in an amendment (a
"Supplemental Certificate Amendment") to this Agreement, to be delivered to or
upon the order of the Beneficiary (or the Holder of a Supplemental
Certificate, in the case of the transfer or exchange thereof, as provided
below), upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

                  (i) the result obtained by multiplying (x) the Seller's
      Participation Amount by (y) the percentage equivalent of the portion of
      the Seller's Interest represented by the DCMOT Certificate, shall not be
      less than 2% of the Pool Balance, in each case as of the date of, and
      after giving effect to, such exchange;

                  (ii) the Beneficiary shall have delivered to the Indenture
      Trustee, the Owner Trustee, any Agent and any Enhancement Provider an
      Issuer Tax Opinion, dated the date of such exchange (or transfer or
      exchange as provided below), with respect thereto;

                  (iii) the Rating Agency Condition (as defined in the Sale
      and Servicing Agreement) shall have been satisfied with respect such
      exchange (or transfer or exchange as provided below); and

                  (iv) the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 10.12
      shall have been complied with.

Any Supplemental Certificate Amendment entered into upon satisfaction of the
foregoing conditions shall be deemed not to have an Adverse Effect (as defined
in the Indenture) as of the date of such amendment or at any time in the
future.

            (b) Any Supplemental Certificate may be transferred or exchanged
by the Holder thereof only upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.

            SECTION 10.11. Transfer of the DCMOT Certificate in Whole.

            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Beneficiary,
as Holder of the DCMOT Certificate, may sell, participate, transfer, assign or
otherwise pledge or convey its entire right, title and interest in the DCMOT
Certificate only to a Designated Affiliate in accordance with Section 7.04 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement and in compliance with the transfer
restrictions set forth in Section 10.12 of this Agreement.

            SECTION 10.12. Transfer Restrictions.

            (a) Securities Law Restrictions. The Seller's Certificates have
not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and will not be
listed on any exchange. No transfer of a Seller's Certificate in whole or in
part after the Effective Date shall be made unless such transfer is made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and
any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from the registration
requirements under the Securities Act and such state securities laws. In the
event that a transfer is to be made in reliance upon an exemption from the
Securities Act and state securities laws, in order to assure compliance with
the Securities Act and such laws, the Holder desiring to effect such transfer
and such Holder's prospective transferee shall each certify to the Owner
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar in writing the facts surrounding the
transfer in substantially the forms set forth in Exhibit C (the "Transferor
Certification") and either Exhibit D (the "Investment Letter") or Exhibit E
(the "Rule 144A Letter"). Except in the case of a transfer as to which the
proposed transferee has provided a Rule 144A Letter, there shall also be
delivered to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar an Opinion of
Counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption from the
Securities Act and state securities laws, which Opinion of Counsel shall not
be an expense of the Trust, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar;
provided that such Opinion of Counsel in respect of the applicable state
securities laws may be a memorandum of law rather than an opinion if such
counsel is not licensed in the applicable jurisdiction. The Beneficiary shall
provide to any Holder of a Seller's Certificate and any prospective transferee
designated by any such Holder, information regarding the Seller's Certificates
and the Receivables and such other information as shall be necessary to
satisfy the condition to eligibility set forth in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act for transfer of any such Seller's Certificate without
registration thereof under the Securities Act pursuant to the registration
exemption provided by Rule 144A. Each Holder of a Seller's Certificate
desiring to effect such a transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify
the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Beneficiary
against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is
not made in accordance with federal and state securities laws. The Owner
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar, as applicable, shall cause each Seller's
Certificate to contain a legend in the form set forth on the form of the DCMOT
Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit B.

            (b) ERISA Restrictions. The Seller's Certificates may not be
acquired by or for the account of (i) an employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA,
(ii) a plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code or (iii) any entity
whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of a plan's investment
in the entity (each, a "Benefit Plan"). By accepting and holding a
Certificate, the Holder thereof shall be deemed to have represented and
warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan; provided, however, that in the case
of any transfer of a Seller's Certificate in whole or in part



                                      28
<PAGE>

after the Effective Date, each prospective transferee of such Seller's
Certificate shall deliver to the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar and the Beneficiary a written certification, upon which the Trust,
the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Beneficiary shall
conclusively rely, stating that the transfer to such prospective transferee of
the Seller's Certificate is in accordance with the restrictions set forth in
this Section 10.12(b) and indemnifying the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar and the Beneficiary against any liability that may
result if the transfer is not made in accordance with this Section 10.12(b).
The Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar, as applicable, shall cause
each Seller's Certificate to contain a legend in the form set forth on the
form of the DCMOT Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit B.

                                  ARTICLE XI

               COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEE BANK AND INDEMNIFICATION

            SECTION 11.01. Trustee Bank Fees and Expenses. The Trustee Bank
will receive all fees and other charges described in a separate fee agreement
between DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC and the Trustee Bank
promptly when due thereunder and the Trustee Bank will be reimbursed for all
other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) incurred by it in connection with its acting as Owner
Trustee of the Trust.

            SECTION 11.02. Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, the Beneficiary hereby agrees, whether or not any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be consummated, to assume liability for,
and hereby indemnifies, protects, saves and keeps harmless the Trustee Bank
and its officers, directors, successors, assigns, legal representatives,
agents and servants (each an "Indemnified Person"), from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes, claims,
actions, investigations, proceedings, costs, expenses or disbursements
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted at any time
against an Indemnified Person (whether or not also indemnified against by any
other Person) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other related documents or the enforcement of any of the terms of any thereof,
the administration of the Trust Estate or the action or inaction of the Owner
Trustee or the Trustee Bank under this Agreement, and the manufacture,
purchase, acceptance, nonacceptance, rejection, ownership, delivery, lease,
possession, use, operation, condition, sale, return or other disposition of
any property (including any strict liability, any liability without fault and
any latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable), except, in any
such case, to the extent that any such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, taxes, claims, actions, investigations, proceedings,
costs, expenses and disbursements are the result of any of the matters
described in the exception in the third sentence of Section 6.01.

            In case any such action, investigation or proceeding will be
brought involving an Indemnified Person, the Beneficiary will assume the
defense thereof, including the employment of counsel and the payment of all
expenses. The Trustee Bank will have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action, investigation or proceeding and to participate in the defense
thereof and the reasonable counsel fees and expenses of such counsel will be
paid by the



                                      29
<PAGE>

Beneficiary. In the event of any claim, action or proceeding for which
indemnity will be sought pursuant to this Section, the Trustee Bank's choice
of legal counsel shall be subject to the approval of the Beneficiary, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            The indemnification set forth herein will survive the termination
of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Trustee Bank.

                                 ARTICLE XII

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            SECTION 12.01. Conveyance by the Owner Trustee is Binding. Any
sale or other conveyance of any part of the Trust Estate by the Owner Trustee
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will bind the Holders of the
Seller's Certificates and will be effective to transfer or convey all
beneficial interest of the Owner Trustee and Beneficiary in and to such part
of the Trust Estate, as the case may be. No purchaser or other grantee will be
required to inquire as to the authorization, necessity, expediency or
regularity of such sale or conveyance or as to the application of any sale or
other proceeds with respect thereto by the Owner Trustee or the officers.

            SECTION 12.02. Instructions; Notices. All instructions, notices,

                  respect to this agreement, and recourse may be had solely to
                  the assets of DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust with
                  respect thereto.

                      DAIMLERCHRYSLER MASTER OWNER TRUST

                               DCMOT CERTIFICATE

            This certifies that DAIMLERCHRYSLER WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES LLC is
the registered owner of a ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) beneficial interest (the
"Percentage Interest") in the property of DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust
(the "Trust"), subject to lien of the Indenture and the provisions of the Sale
and Servicing Agreement (each, as defined below). The Trust is a Delaware
statutory trust governed by the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as
of December 16, 2004 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the
"Trust Agreement"), between DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC
(together with its successors and permitted assigns, "DCWR") and Chase
Manhattan Bank USA, National Association, as owner trustee (together with its
successors in such capacity, the "Owner Trustee"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined in this Certificate shall have the meanings assigned
thereto in the Trust Agreement.



                                      B-1
<PAGE>

            The corpus of the Trust consists primarily of wholesale (i.e.,
dealer floorplan) receivables (the "Receivables") generated from time to time
in the ordinary course of business in a portfolio of revolving financing
arrangements (the "Accounts") of DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC
(together with its successors and permitted assigns, "DCS") meeting certain
eligibility criteria. The Receivables and related collateral security are sold
by DCWR to the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the "Sale
and Servicing Agreement"), among DCWR as Seller, DCS as Servicer, and the
Trust. This DCMOT Certificate does not represent an interest in or obligation
of DCS, DCWR, DaimlerChrysler Corporation or any of their affiliates.

            This Certificate is the "DCMOT Certificate" and a "Seller's
Certificate" referred to in the Trust Agreement, with the Holder hereof being
the "Beneficiary" under the Trust Agreement. Until the issuance of any
Supplemental Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement, this DCMOT
Certificate shall be the sole Seller's Certificate.

            The Holder of this DCMOT Certificate shall be entitled to receive,
to the extent provided in the Trust Agreement, the Percentage Interest in the
distributions in respect of the Seller's Interest which includes such property
of the Trust not allocated to the Noteholders' Interest pursuant to the Sale
and Servicing Agreement, the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the
"Indenture"), between the Trust and The Bank of New York, as indenture trustee
(together with its successors in such capacity, the "Indenture Trustee), and
the Indenture Supplements relating to the Auto Dealer Loan Asset Backed Notes
(the "Notes") issued by the Trust.

            The parties to the Trust Agreement intend that, for income and
franchise tax purposes, (a) so long as there is a single owner of the Seller
Certificates, the Trust will be treated as a security device and disregarded
as an entity and its assets shall be treated as owned in whole by the
Beneficiary and (b) if there is more than one beneficial owner of the Seller's
Certificates, the Trust shall be treated as a partnership for income and
franchise tax purposes, with the assets of the partnership being the
Receivables and other assets of the Trust, the partners of the partnership
being the Holders of the Seller's Certificates and the Notes issued by the
Trust constituting debt of the partnership. The parties to the Trust Agreement
will file all their tax returns in a manner consistent with that intent unless
otherwise required by a taxing authority. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Trust Agreement, any tax elections required or permitted to be
made by the Trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
otherwise will be made by the Beneficiary. The Trust will not elect to be
treated as a corporation for any tax purpose.

            This DCMOT Certificate is issued under and is subject to the
terms, provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement, to which agreement,
as amended and supplemented from time to time, the Holder of this DCMOT
Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof hereby assents and is bound.

            This DCMOT Certificate does not purport to summarize the Trust
Agreement, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Indenture
Supplements, and reference is hereby made to such agreement for information
with respect to the interests, rights, benefits, obligations and duties
evidenced hereby. Copies of the Trust Agreement, the Sale and Servicing

Agreement.

            Notwithstanding any prior termination of the Trust or Trust
Agreement, the Owner Trustee, the Beneficiary and, by its acceptance of a
Seller's Certificate, each Holder thereof covenants and agrees that it shall
not at any time with respect to the Trust acquiesce, petition or otherwise
invoke or cause the Trust to invoke the process of any court or government
authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against the Trust
under any Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or appointing

a security interest in such property by the Issuer hereunder to the Indenture
Trustee.

          In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, and of
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby amend and restate the Existing
Indenture in its entirety as follows:

                            RECITALS OF THE ISSUER

          The Issuer has duly authorized the execution and delivery of this
Indenture to provide for the issuance of its notes to be issued in one or more

accordance with its terms, have been done.

                                GRANTING CLAUSE

          The Issuer hereby grants to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit

benefit of the Collateral, and (c) the Indenture Trustee, in its individual

title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to:

          (i)  the Receivables transferred to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale
               and Servicing Agreement, including the Receivables transferred
               to the Issuer pursuant to the Program Amendment Agreement, in
               each case together with all the Collateral Security with
               respect thereto;

          (ii) the Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account;

         (iii) any Supplemental Account;

          (iv) all sub-Accounts of the Collection Account, the Excess Funding
               Account or any Supplemental Account;



<PAGE>

               through the Collection Account, the Excess Funding Account, any
               Supplemental Account or any sub-Account thereof;

          (vi) all rights, benefits and powers under any Enhancement Agreement
               relating to any series or class of Notes;

         (vii) all rights of enforcement of the Issuer against DCWR, DCS or
               the CARCO Trust under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
               Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Program Amendment
               Agreement, as applicable, and against the Beneficiary under the
               Trust Agreement;

        (viii) all present and future claims, demands, causes of and choses
               in action in respect of any of the foregoing and all interest,
               principal, payments and distributions of any nature or type on
               any of the foregoing;

to the extent specified in the applicable Indenture Supplement or Enhancement
Agreement, the obligations under any applicable Enhancement Agreements)

Supplement. This Indenture is a security agreement within the meaning of the
UCC.

          The Indenture Trustee acknowledges the grant of such Security
Interest, and accepts the Collateral in trust hereunder in accordance with the
provisions hereof and agrees to perform the duties herein.

          Particular Notes and Enhancement Agreements will benefit from the
Security Interest to the extent (and only to the extent) proceeds of and
distributions on the Collateral are allocated for their benefit pursuant to
this Indenture and the applicable Indenture Supplement.

conditions upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated, issued and

amended by the Trust Indenture Reform Act of 1990, as in force at the date as
of which this Indenture was executed except as provided in Section 1005.

          "UCC" means, unless the context otherwise requires, the Uniform
Commercial Code, as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction.

          "U.S. Depository" means, unless otherwise specified by the Issuer
pursuant to either Section 204, 206, or 301, with respect to Notes of any
class issuable or issued as Global Note within the United States, The
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, or any successor thereto
registered as a clearing agency under the Securities Exchange Act, or other
applicable statute regulation.

          SECTION 102. Compliance Certificates and Opinions. Upon any
application or request by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee to take any
action under any provision of this Indenture, the Issuer will furnish to the
Indenture Trustee (i) an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions
precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed
action have been complied with and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel stating that in
the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent, if any, have been
complied with, except that in the case of any such application or request as
to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any
provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or
request, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.

          The Indenture Trustee may rely, as to authorization by the Issuer of
any class of Notes, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity,
binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the
other documents delivered pursuant to Section 310 and this Section, as
applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Notes of such
class.

          Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a
condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture (except for the written
statement required by Section 1104) will include:

          (a) a statement that each individual signing such certificate or
opinion has read such covenant or condition and the definitions herein
relating thereto;

          (b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination
or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such
certificate or opinion are based;

          (c) a statement that such individual has made such examination or
investigation as is necessary to express an informed opinion as to whether or
not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and



                                      16
<PAGE>



          (d) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such
individual, such condition or covenant has been complied with.

          SECTION 103. Form of Documents Delivered to Indenture Trustee. In
any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by
an opinion of, one or more specified Persons, one such Person may certify or
give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such
Persons as to the other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an
opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

          Any certificate or opinion of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it
relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations
by, counsel, unless the Issuer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care
should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations are erroneous.
Any such certificate or opinion of, or representation by, counsel may be
based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion
of, or representations by, the Issuer stating that the information with
respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Issuer, unless
such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that
the certificate or opinion or representations are erroneous.

          Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and
form one instrument.

          SECTION 104. Acts of Noteholders.

          (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action (collectively, "action") provided by this Indenture to
be given or taken by Noteholders of any series or class may be embodied in and
evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by
such Noteholders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and,
except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action will become
effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Indenture
Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer. Such
instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced
thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Noteholders
signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent will be sufficient for
any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 801) conclusive in favor
of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in
this Section.

          (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness to such
execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer
authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the
individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the
execution thereof. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or a
member of a partnership, on behalf of such corporation or partnership, such
certificate or affidavit will also constitute sufficient proof of his
authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner which the Indenture Trustee deems sufficient.



                                      17
<PAGE>



          (c) (i) The ownership of Registered Notes will be proved by the Note
Register.

               (ii) The ownership of Bearer Notes or coupons will be proved by
          the production of such Bearer Notes or coupons or by a certificate,
          satisfactory to the Issuer, executed by any bank, trust company or
          recognized securities dealer, wherever situated, satisfactory to the
          Issuer. Each such certificate will be dated and will state that on
          the date thereof a Bearer Note or coupon bearing a specified serial
          number was deposited with or exhibited to such bank, trust company
          or recognized securities dealer by the Person named in such
          certificate. Any such certificate may be issued in respect of one or
          more Bearer Notes or coupons specified therein. The holding by the
          Person named in any such certificate of any Bearer Note specified
          therein will be presumed to continue for a period of one year from
          the date of such certificate unless at the time of any determination
          of such holding (A) another certificate bearing a later date issued
          in respect of the same Bearer Note or coupon produced, (B) the
          Bearer Note or coupon specified in such certificate is produced by
          some other Person or (C) the Bearer Note or coupon specified in such
          certificate has ceased to be Outstanding.

          (d) If the Issuer will solicit from the Holders any action, the
Issuer may, at its option, by an Officer's Certificate, fix in advance a
record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such action, but
the Issuer will have no obligation to do so. If the Issuer does not so fix a
record date, such record date will be the later of thirty (30) days before the
first solicitation of such action or the date of the most recent list of
Noteholders furnished to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 901 before
such solicitation. Such action may be given before or after the record date,
but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date
will be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders
of the requisite proportion of Notes Outstanding have authorized or agreed or
consented to such action, and for that purpose the Notes Outstanding will be
computed as of the record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement
or consent by the Holders on the record date will be deemed effective unless
it will become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not
later than six (6) months after the record date.

          (e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action by the Holder of any Note will bind the Holder of every
Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
thereof, in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Indenture
Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Note.

          SECTION 105. Notices, etc., to Indenture Trustee and Issuer. Any
action of Noteholders or other document provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

          (a) the Indenture Trustee by any Noteholder or by the Issuer will be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in
writing to or with the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or



                                      18
<PAGE>



          (b) the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or by any Noteholder will be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (except as provided in Section 701(c))
if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Issuer addressed
to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph
of this Indenture or at any other address previously furnished in writing to
the Indenture Trustee by the Issuer.

          SECTION 106. Notices to Noteholders; Waiver.

          (a) Where this Indenture, any Indenture Supplement or any Registered
Note provides for notice to Registered Noteholders of any event, such notice
will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein, in such Indenture
Supplement or in such Registered Note expressly provided) if in writing and
mailed, first-class postage prepaid, sent by facsimile, sent by electronic
transmission or personally delivered to each Holder of Registered Note
affected by such event, at such Noteholder's address as it appears in the Note
Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest
date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to
Registered Noteholders is given by mail, facsimile, electronic transmission or
delivery neither the failure to mail, send by facsimile, electronic
transmission or deliver such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed,
to any particular Noteholders will affect the sufficiency of such notice with
respect to other Noteholders and any notice that is mailed, sent by facsimile,
electronic transmission or delivered in the manner herein provided shall
conclusively have been presumed to have been duly given.

          Where this Indenture, any Indenture Supplement or any Registered
Note provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing
by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the
event, and such waiver will be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by Registered Noteholders will be filed with the Indenture Trustee, but
such filing will not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action
taken in reliance upon such waiver.

          (b) In case, by reason of the suspension of regular mail service as
a result of a strike, work stoppage or otherwise, it will be impractical to
mail notice of any event to any Holder of a Registered Note when such notice
is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any
method of notification as will be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and
the Issuer will be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

          (c) No notice will be given by mail, facsimile, electronic
transmission or otherwise delivered to a Holder of Bearer Notes or coupons in
bearer form. In the case of any class with respect to which any Bearer Notes
are Outstanding, any notice required or permitted to be given to Holders of
such Bearer Notes will be published in an Authorized Newspaper within the time
period prescribed in this Indenture or the applicable Indenture Supplement.

          (d) With respect to any class of Notes, the applicable Indenture
Supplement may specify different or additional means of giving notice to the
Holders of the Notes of such class.



                                      19
<PAGE>



          (e) Where this Indenture provides for notice to any Note Rating
Agency, failure to give such notice will not affect any other rights or
obligations created hereunder and will not under any circumstance constitute
an Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If and to the extent
that any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the
duties imposed by, or with another provision (an "incorporated provision")
included in this Indenture by operation of, Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, of
the Trust Indenture Act, such imposed duties or incorporated provision will
control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision
of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter
provision will be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or
excluded, as the case may be.

          SECTION 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article
and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only
and will not affect the construction hereof.

          SECTION 109. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in
this Indenture by the Issuer will bind its successors and assigns, whether so
expressed or not. All covenants and agreements of the Indenture Trustee in
this Indenture shall bind its successors, co-trustees and agents of the
Indenture Trustee.

          SECTION 110. Separability. In case any provision in this Indenture
or in the Notes will be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

          SECTION 111. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in
any Notes, express or implied, will give to any Person, other than the parties
hereto and their successors hereunder, any Authenticating Agent or Paying
Agent, the Note Registrar, the Enhancement Providers (to the extent specified
in the applicable Enhancement Agreements) and the Holders of Notes (or such of
them as may be affected thereby), any benefit or any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under this Indenture.

          SECTION 112. Governing Law. THIS INDENTURE WILL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE
NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW) AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

          SECTION 113. Counterparts. This Indenture may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which so executed will be deemed to be an
original, but all such counterparts will together constitute but one and the
same instrument.

          SECTION 114. Indenture Referred to in the Trust Agreement. This is
the Indenture referred to in the Trust Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE II

                                  NOTE FORMS

          SECTION 201. Forms Generally. The Notes will have such appropriate
insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or
permitted by this Indenture or the applicable Indenture Supplement and may
have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends
or endorsements placed thereon, as may be required to comply with applicable
laws or regulations or with the rules of any securities exchange, or as may,
consistently herewith, be determined by the Issuer, as evidenced by the
Issuer's execution of such Notes. Any portion of the text of any Note may be
set forth on the reverse thereof, with an appropriate reference thereto on the
face of the Note.

          The definitive Notes will be typewritten, printed, lithographed or
engraved or produced by any combination of these methods (with or without
steel engraved borders) or may be produced in any other manner, all as
determined by the Issuer, as evidenced by the Issuer's execution of such
Notes, subject, with respect to the Notes of any series or class, to the rules
of any securities exchange on which such Notes are listed.

          SECTION 202. Forms of Notes. Each Note will be in one of the forms
approved from time to time by or pursuant to an Indenture Supplement. Before
the delivery of a Note to the Indenture Trustee for authentication in any form
approved by or pursuant to an Issuer Certificate, the Issuer will deliver to
the Indenture Trustee the Issuer Certificate by or pursuant to which such form
of Note has been approved, which Issuer Certificate will have attached thereto
a true and correct copy of the form of Note which has been approved thereby
or, if an Issuer Certificate authorizes a specific officer or officers of the
Beneficiary to approve a form of Note, a certificate of such officer or
officers approving the form of Note attached thereto. Any form of Note
approved by or pursuant to an Issuer Certificate must be acceptable as to form
to the Indenture Trustee, such acceptance to be evidenced by the Indenture
Trustee's authentication of Notes in that form or a certificate signed by an
Indenture Trustee Authorized Officer and delivered to the Issuer.

          SECTION 203. Form of Indenture Trustee's Certificate of
Authentication. The form of Indenture Trustee's Certificate of Authentication
for any Note issued pursuant to this Indenture will be substantially as
follows:



                                      21

               INDENTURE TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION

          This is one of the Notes of the series or class designated therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

                             The Bank of New York,
                             as Indenture Trustee,



                             By:   ______________________________________
                                      Authorized Signatory

                             Dated:______________________________________

          SECTION 204. Notes Issuable in the Form of a Global Note.

          (a) If the Issuer establishes pursuant to Sections 202 and 301 that
the Notes of a particular series or class are to be issued in whole or in part
in the form of one or more Global Notes, then the Issuer will execute and the
Indenture Trustee or its agent will, in accordance with Section 303 and the
Issuer Certificate delivered to the Indenture Trustee or its agent thereunder,
authenticate and deliver, such Global Note or Notes, which, unless otherwise
provided in the applicable Indenture Supplement (i) will represent, and will
be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate Stated Principal Amount (or
in the case of Discount Notes, the aggregate Stated Principal Amount at the
Expected Principal Payment Date of such Notes) of the Outstanding Notes of
such series or class to be represented by such Global Note or Notes, or such
portion thereof as the Issuer will specify in an Issuer Certificate, (ii) in
the case of Registered Notes, will be registered in the name of the Depository
for such Global Note or Notes or its nominee, (iii) will be delivered by the
Indenture Trustee or its agent to the Depository or pursuant to the
Depository's instruction, (iv) if applicable, will bear a legend substantially
to the following effect: "Unless this Note is presented by an authorized
representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation
("DTC"), to the Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or
payment, and any note issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in
such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and
any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by
an authorized representative of DTC), any transfer, pledge or other use hereof
for value or otherwise by or to any person is wrongful inasmuch as the
registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein" and (v) may bear
such other legend as the Issuer, upon advice of counsel, deems to be
applicable.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 204 or of
Section 305, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, unless the
terms of a Global Note or the applicable Indenture Supplement expressly permit
such Global Note to be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Notes, a
Global Note may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner
provided in Section 305, only to a nominee of the Depository for such Global
Note, or to the Depository, or a successor Depository for such Global Note
selected or approved by the Issuer, or to a nominee of such successor
Depository.



                                      22
<PAGE>



          (c) With respect to Notes issued within the United States, unless
otherwise specified in the applicable Indenture Supplement, or with respect to
Notes issued outside the United States, if specified in the applicable
Indenture Supplement:

               (i) If at any time the Depository for a Global Note notifies
          the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository
          for such Global Note or if at any time the Depository for the Notes
          for such series or class ceases to be a clearing agency registered
          under the Securities Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or
          regulation, the Issuer will appoint a successor Depository with
          respect to such Global Note. If a successor Depository for such
          Global Note is not appointed by the Issuer within ninety (90) days
          after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such
          ineligibility, the Issuer will execute, and the Indenture Trustee or
          its agent, upon receipt of an Issuer Certificate requesting the
          authentication and delivery of individual Notes of such series or
          class in exchange for such Global Note, will authenticate and
          deliver, individual Notes of such series or class of like tenor and
          terms in an aggregate Stated Principal Amount equal to the Stated
          Principal Amount of the Global Note in exchange for such Global
          Note.

               (ii) The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion
          determine that the Notes of any series or class or portion thereof
          issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Notes will no
          longer be represented by such Global Note or Notes. In such event
          the Issuer will execute, and the Indenture Trustee, upon receipt of
          an Issuer request for the authentication and delivery of individual
          Notes of such series or class in exchange in whole or in part for
          such Global Note, will authenticate and deliver individual Notes of
          such series or class of like tenor and terms in definitive form in
          an aggregate Stated Principal Amount equal to the Stated Principal
          Amount of such Global Note or Notes representing such series or
          class or portion thereof in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.

               (iii) If specified by the Issuer pursuant to Sections 202 and
          301 with respect to Notes issued or issuable in the form of a Global
          Note, the Depository for such Global Note may surrender such Global
          Note in exchange in whole or in part for individual Notes of such
          series or class of like tenor and terms in definitive form on such
          terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depository. Thereupon
          the Issuer will execute, and the Indenture Trustee or its agent will
          authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (A) to each Person
          specified by such Depository a new Note or Notes of the same series
          or class of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination
          as requested by such Person in aggregate Stated Principal Amount
          equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in
          the Global Note; and (B) to such Depository a new Global Note of
          like tenor and terms and in an authorized denomination equal to the
          difference, if any, between the Stated Principal Amount of the
          surrendered Global Note and the aggregate Stated Principal Amount of
          Notes delivered to the Holders thereof.

               (iv) If any Event of Default has occurred with respect to such
          Global Notes, and Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 50% of
          the unpaid Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Global Notes
          of that class advise the Indenture Trustee and the Depository that a
          Global Note is no longer in the best interest of the Noteholders,
          the Holders of Global Notes of that class may exchange such Notes
          for individual Notes.



                                      23
<PAGE>



               (v) In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three
          paragraphs, the Issuer will execute and the Indenture Trustee or its
          agent will authenticate and deliver individual Notes in definitive
          registered form in authorized denominations. Upon the exchange of
          the entire Stated Principal Amount of a Global Note for individual
          Notes, such Global Note will be canceled by the Indenture Trustee or
          its agent. Except as provided in the preceding paragraphs, Notes
          issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Section will
          be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as
          the Depository for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from
          its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, will instruct the
          Indenture Trustee or the Note Registrar. The Indenture Trustee or
          the Note Registrar will deliver such Notes to the Persons in whose
          names such Notes are so registered.

          SECTION 205.  Temporary Global Notes and Permanent Global Notes.


          (a) If specified in the applicable Indenture Supplement for any
series or class, all or any portion of a Global Note may initially be issued
in the form of a single temporary Global Bearer Note or Registered Note (the
"Temporary Global Note"), without interest coupons, in the denomination of the
entire aggregate principal amount of such series or class and substantially in
the form set forth in the exhibit with respect thereto attached to the
applicable Indenture Supplement. The Temporary Global Note will be
authenticated by the Indenture Trustee upon the same conditions, in
substantially the same manner and with the same effect as the Notes in
definitive form. The Temporary Global Note may be exchanged as described below
or in the applicable Indenture Supplement for permanent global Bearer Notes or
Registered Notes (the "Permanent Global Notes").

          (b) Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Indenture
Supplement, exchanges of beneficial interests in Temporary Global Notes for
beneficial interests in Permanent Global Notes will be made as provided in
this clause. The Beneficiary will, upon its determination of the date of
completion of the distribution of the Notes of such series or class, so advise
the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the Foreign Depository, and each foreign
clearing agency forthwith. Without unnecessary delay, but in any event not
prior to the Exchange Date, the Issuer will execute and deliver to the
Indenture Trustee at its London office or its designated agent outside the
United States Permanent Global Notes in bearer or registered form (as
specified in the applicable Indenture Supplement) in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the entire aggregate principal amount of such series or class.
Bearer Notes so issued and delivered may have coupons attached. The Temporary
Global Note may be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of
Permanent Global Notes only on or after the Exchange Date. A United States
Person may exchange the portion of the Temporary Global Note beneficially
owned by it only for an equal aggregate principal amount of Permanent Global
Notes in registered form bearing the applicable legend set forth in the form
of Registered Note attached to the applicable Indenture Supplement and having
a minimum denomination of $500,000, which may be in temporary form if the
Issuer so elects. The Issuer may waive the $500,000 minimum denomination
requirement if it so elects. Upon any demand for exchange for Permanent Global
Notes in accordance with this clause, the Issuer will cause the Indenture
Trustee to authenticate and deliver the Permanent Global Notes to the Holder
(x) outside the United States, in the case of Bearer Notes and (y) according
to the instructions of the Holder, in the case of Registered Notes, but in
either case only upon presentation to the Indenture Trustee of a written
statement



                                      24

substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 (or such other form as the Issuer may
determine) with respect to the Temporary Global Note, or portion thereof being
exchanged, signed by a foreign clearing agency and dated on the Exchange Date
or a subsequent date, to the effect that it has received in writing or by
tested telex a certification substantially in the form of (i) in the case of
beneficial ownership of the Temporary Global Note, or a portion thereof being
exchanged, by a United States institutional investor pursuant to this clause,
the certificate in the form of Exhibit D-2 (or such other form as the Issuer
may determine) signed by the beneficiary which sold the relevant Notes or (ii)
in all other cases, the certificate in the form of Exhibit D-3 (or such other
form as the Issuer may determine), the certificate referred to in this clause
(ii) being dated on the earlier of the first payment of interest in respect of
such Note and the date of the delivery of such Note in definitive form. Upon
receipt of such certification, the Indenture Trustee will cause the Temporary
Global Note to be endorsed in accordance with paragraph (d). Any exchange as
provided in this Section will be made free of charge to the Holders and the
beneficial owners of the Temporary Global Note and to the beneficial owners of
the Permanent Global Note issued in exchange, except that a Person receiving
the Permanent Global Note must bear the cost of insurance, postage,
transportation and the like in the event that such Person does not receive
such Permanent Global Note in person at the offices of a foreign clearing
agency.

          (c) The delivery to the Indenture Trustee by a foreign clearing
agency of any written statement referred to above may be relied upon by the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee as conclusive evidence that a corresponding
certification or certifications has or have been delivered to such foreign
clearing agency pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.

          (d) Upon any such exchange of all or a portion of the Temporary
Global Note for a Permanent Global Note or Notes, such Temporary Global Note
will be endorsed by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee to reflect the
reduction of its principal amount by an amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such Permanent Global Note or Notes. Until so exchanged in
full, such Temporary Global Note will in all respects be entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture as Permanent Global Notes authenticated and
delivered hereunder except that the beneficial owners of such Temporary Global
Note will not be entitled to receive payments of interests on the Notes until
they have exchanged their beneficial interests in such Temporary Global Note
for Permanent Global Notes.

          SECTION 206. Beneficial Ownership of Global Notes. Until definitive
Notes have been issued to the applicable Noteholders pursuant to Section 204
or as otherwise specified in any applicable Indenture Supplement,

          (a) the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee may deal with the
applicable clearing agency and the clearing agency's participants for all
purposes (including the making of distributions) as the authorized
representatives of the respective Note Owners; and

          (b) the rights of the respective Note Owners will be exercised only
through the applicable clearing agency and the clearing agency's participants
and will be limited to those established by law and agreements between such
Note Owners and the clearing agency and/or the clearing agency's participants.
Pursuant to the operating rules of the applicable clearing agency, unless and
until Notes in definitive form are issued pursuant to Section 204, the
clearing agency will make book-entry transfers among the clearing agency's
participants and receive and



                                      25
<PAGE>



transmit distributions of principal and interest on the related Notes to such
clearing agency's participants.

          For purposes of any provision of this Indenture requiring or
permitting actions with the consent of, or at the direction of, Noteholders
evidencing a specified percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Outstanding Notes, such direction or consent may be given by Note Owners
(acting through the clearing agency and the clearing agency's participants)
owning interests in Notes evidencing the requisite percentage of principal
amount of Notes.

          SECTION 207. Notices to Depository. Whenever any notice or other
communication is required to be given to Noteholders with respect to which
book-entry Notes have been issued, unless and until Notes in definitive form
will have been issued to the related Note Owners, the Indenture Trustee will,
at the written direction of the Issuer, give all such notices and
communications to the applicable Depository.

                                 ARTICLE III

limited.

          (b) The Notes may be issued in one or more series or classes up to
an aggregate Stated Principal Amount of Notes as from time to time may be
authorized by the Issuer. All Notes of each series or class under this
Indenture will in all respects be equally and ratably entitled to the benefits
hereof with respect to such series or class without preference, priority or
distinction on account of the actual time of the authentication and delivery
or the Expected Principal Payment Date or Legal Maturity Date of the Notes of
such series or class, except as specified in the applicable Indenture
Supplement for such series or class.

          (c) Each Note issued must be part of a series or class of Notes for
purposes of allocations pursuant to Article V. A series of Notes is created
pursuant to an Indenture Supplement. A class of Notes of that series is
created pursuant to such Indenture Supplement.

          (d) Each series of Notes may, but need not be, subdivided into
multiple classes. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to
a class of Notes include a series of Notes that has not been subdivided into
multiple classes. Notes belonging to a class in any series may be entitled to
specified payment priorities over other classes of Notes in that series.

          to be payable, at the election of the Issuer or a Holder thereof, in
          a currency or currencies other than that in which the Notes are
          stated to be payable, the period or periods within which, and the
          terms and conditions upon which, such election may be made; (vii) if
          the amount of payments of principal of or interest, if any, on such

          to be payable, (B) changes in the prices of one or more other
          securities or groups or indexes of securities or (C) changes in the

          optional or mandatory redemption provisions, be redeemed, and the

          if any, or the formula or index on which such rate will be
          determined, including all relevant definitions, and the date from
          which interest will accrue;

               (x) each Interest Payment Date, Expected Principal Payment Date
          and Legal Maturity Date for such Notes;

               (xi) the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of such Notes, and the
          means for calculating the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of
          such Notes;

               (xii) whether or not application will be made to list such
          Notes on any securities exchange;

               (xiii) any Events of Default or Early Redemption Events with
          respect to such Notes, if not set forth herein and any additions,
          deletions or other changes to the Events of Default or Early

<PAGE>



with power to act on behalf of the Indenture Trustee and subject to its
direction in the authentication and delivery of such Notes in connection with
such transactions as will be specified in the provisions of this Indenture or
in or pursuant to the applicable Indenture Supplement creating such series or
class;

               (xv) if such Notes will be issued in whole or in part in the
          form of a Global Note or Global Notes, the terms and conditions, if
          any, upon which such Global Note or Global Notes may be exchanged in
          whole or in part for other individual Notes; and the Depository for
          such Global Note or Global Notes (if other than the Depository
          specified in Section 101);

               (xvi) the subordination of such Notes to any other indebtedness
          of the Issuer, including the Notes of any other series or class;

               (xvii) if such Notes are to have the benefit of any Enhancement
          Agreement, the terms and provisions of such agreement;

          or class of Notes; and

               (xxi) any other terms of such Notes;

all upon such terms as may be determined in or pursuant to an Indenture
Supplement with respect to such series or class.

          (f) The form of the Notes of each series or class will be
established pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture and the related
Indenture Supplement creating such series or class. The Notes of each series
or class will be distinguished from the Notes of each other series or class in
such manner, reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, as the Issuer
may determine.

          (g) Unless otherwise provided with respect to Notes of a particular
series or class, the Notes of any particular series or class will be issued in
registered form, without coupons.

          (h) Any terms or provisions in respect of the Notes of any series or
class issued under this Indenture may be determined pursuant to this Section
by providing in the applicable Indenture Supplement for the method by which
such terms or provisions will be determined.



                                      28
<PAGE>



          (i) The Notes of each series or class may have such Expected
Principal Payment Date or Dates or Legal Maturity Date or Dates, be issuable
at such premium over or discount from their face value, bear interest at such
rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating), from such date or dates,
payable in such installments and on such dates and at such place or places to
the Holders of Notes registered as such on such Record Dates, or may bear no
interest, and have such terms, all as will be provided for in or pursuant to
the applicable Indenture Supplement.

          SECTION 302.  Denominations. The Notes of each class will be
issuable in such denominations and currency as will be provided in the
provisions of this Indenture or in or pursuant to the applicable Indenture
Supplement. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the
Registered Notes of any class, the Registered Notes of that class will be
issued in denominations of $1,000 and multiples thereof. In the absence of any
such provisions with respect to the Bearer Notes of any class, the Bearer
Notes of that class will be issued in denominations of 1,000, 5,000, 50,000
and 100,000 units of the applicable currency.

          SECTION 303.  Execution, Authentication and Delivery and Dating.

          (a) The Notes will be executed on behalf of the Issuer by an Issuer
Authorized Officer. The signature of any officer of the Beneficiary (or a
member of the Beneficiary acting on behalf of the Beneficiary) or the Owner
Trustee on the Notes may be manual or facsimile.

          (b) Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals
who were at any time an Issuer Authorized Officer will bind the Issuer,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices before the authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold
such offices at the date of issuance of such Notes.

          (c) At any time and from time to time after the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Notes executed by the
Issuer to the Indenture Trustee for authentication; and the Indenture Trustee
will, upon request by an Officer's Certificate, authenticate and deliver such
Notes as in this Indenture provided and not otherwise.

          (d) Before any such authentication and delivery, the Indenture
Trustee will be provided with, in addition to any Officer's Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel required to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to Section 102, the Issuer Certificate and any other opinion or certificate
relating to the issuance of the series or class of Notes required to be
furnished pursuant to Section 202 or Section 310.

          (e) The Indenture Trustee will not be required to authenticate such
Notes if the issue thereof will adversely affect the Indenture Trustee's own
rights, duties or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture.

          (f) Unless otherwise provided in the form of Note for any series or
class, all Notes will be dated the date of their authentication.

          (g) No Note will be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or
be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Note a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Indenture Trustee by manual



                                      29
<PAGE>



signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Note will
be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder.

          SECTION 304. Temporary Notes.

          (a) Pending the preparation of definitive Notes of any class, the
Issuer may execute, and, upon receipt of the documents required by Section
303, together with an Officer's Certificate, the Indenture Trustee will
authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes which are printed, lithographed,
typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized
denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Notes in lieu of
which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as the Issuer may determine, as evidenced
by the Issuer's execution of such Notes.

          (b) If temporary Notes of any class are issued, the Issuer will
cause definitive Notes of such class to be prepared without unreasonable
delay. After the preparation of definitive Notes, the temporary Notes of such
class will be exchangeable for definitive Notes of such class upon surrender
of the temporary Notes of such class at the office or agency of the Issuer in
a Place of Payment, without charge to the Holder; and upon surrender for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes the Issuer will execute and
the Indenture Trustee will authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a
like Stated Principal Amount of definitive Notes of such class of authorized
denominations and of like tenor and terms. Until so exchanged the temporary
Notes of such class will in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Notes of such class.

          SECTION 305. Registration, Transfer and Exchange.

          (a) The Issuer will keep or cause to be kept a register (herein
sometimes referred to as the "Note Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer will provide for the
registration of Registered Notes, or of Registered Notes of a particular
class, and for transfers of Registered Notes or of Registered Notes of such
class. Any such register will be in written form or in any other form capable
of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all
reasonable times the information contained in such register or registers will
be available for inspection by the Indenture Trustee at the office or agency
to be maintained by the Issuer as provided in Section 1102.

          (b) Subject to Section 204, upon surrender for transfer of any
Registered Note of any class at the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place
of Payment, if the requirements of Section 8-401(a) of the UCC are met, the
Issuer will execute, and, upon receipt of such surrendered note, the Indenture
Trustee will authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated
transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Notes of such class of
any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate Stated Principal Amount,
Expected Principal Payment Date and Legal Maturity Date and of like terms.

          (c) Subject to Section 204, at the option of the Holder, Notes of
any class may be exchanged for other Notes of such class of any authorized
denominations, of a like aggregate Stated Principal Amount, Expected Principal
Payment Date and Legal Maturity Date and of like



                                      30
<PAGE>



terms, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or agency.
Registered Notes, including Registered Notes received in exchange for Bearer
Notes, may not be exchanged for Bearer Notes. At the option of the Holder of a
Bearer Note, subject to applicable laws and regulations, Bearer Notes may be
exchanged for other Bearer Notes or Registered Notes (of the same class) of
authorized denominations of like aggregate fractional undivided interests in
the Noteholders' interest, upon surrender of the Bearer Notes to be exchanged
at an office or agency of the Note Registrar located outside the United
States. Each Bearer Note surrendered pursuant to this Section will have
attached thereto all unmatured coupons; provided, however, that any Bearer
Note, so surrendered after the close of business on the last day of the month
preceding the relevant Payment Date need not have attached the coupon relating
to such Payment Date. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the
Issuer will execute, and the Indenture Trustee will authenticate and deliver
(in the case of Bearer Notes, outside the United States), the Notes which the
Noteholders making the exchange are entitled to receive.

          (d) All Notes issued upon any transfer or exchange of Notes will be
the valid and legally binding obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes
surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

          (e) Every Note presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange
will (if so required by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee) be duly endorsed,
or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Issuer and the Note Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing.

          (f) Unless otherwise provided in the Note to be transferred or
exchanged, no service charge will be made on any Noteholder for any transfer
or exchange of Notes, but the Issuer may (unless otherwise provided in such
Note) require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or
exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304 or 1006 not
involving any transfer.

          (g) None of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, any agent of the
Indenture Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Note Registrar will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such
beneficial ownership interests.

          (h) The Issuer initially appoints The Bank of New York to act as
Note Registrar for the Registered Notes on its behalf. The Issuer may at any
time and from time to time authorize any Person to act as Note Registrar in
place of the Indenture Trustee with respect to any class of Notes issued under
this Indenture.

          (i) Registration of transfer of Notes containing the following
legend or to which the following legend is applicable:

          THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
          1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"). NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY
          PORTION HEREOF MAY BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT IN



                                      31
<PAGE>



          COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES
          ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF ANY STATE BLUE SKY OR
          SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM SUCH
          REGISTRATION PROVISIONS. THE TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE IS SUBJECT TO
          CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE INDENTURE REFERRED TO HEREIN.

will be effected only if such transfer is made pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, or is exempt from the
registration requirements under the Securities Act. In the event that
registration of a transfer is to be made in reliance upon an exemption from
the registration requirements under the Securities Act other than Rule 144A
under the Securities Act or Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the
Securities Act, the transferor or the transferee will deliver, at its expense,
to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, an investment letter from the
transferee, substantially in the form of the investment letter attached hereto
as Exhibit C or such other form as the Issuer may determine, and no
registration of transfer will be made until such letter is so delivered.

          Notes issued upon registration or transfer of, or Notes issued in
exchange for, Notes bearing the legend referred to above will also bear such
legend unless the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Note Registrar receive
an Opinion of Counsel, satisfactory to each of them, to the effect that such
legend may be removed.

          Whenever a Note containing the legend referred to above is presented
to the Note Registrar for registration of transfer, the Note Registrar will
promptly seek instructions from the Issuer regarding such transfer and will be
entitled to receive an Issuer Certificate prior to registering any such
transfer. The Issuer hereby agrees to indemnify the Note Registrar and the
Indenture Trustee and to hold each of them harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part
arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by them in
relation to any such instructions furnished pursuant to this clause.

          SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Notes.

          (a) If (i) any mutilated Note (together, in the case of Bearer
Notes, with all unmatured coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) is
surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee
receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of
any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Issuer
will execute and upon its request the Indenture Trustee will authenticate and
deliver (in the case of Bearer Notes, outside the United States), in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new
Note of like tenor, series or class, Expected Principal Payment Date, Legal
Maturity Date and Stated Principal Amount, bearing a number not
contemporaneously Outstanding.

          (b) In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has
become or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion
may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note.



                                      32
<PAGE>



          (c) Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section, the Issuer
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) connected
therewith.

          (d) Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any
destroyed, lost or stolen Note will constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Note will be at any time enforceable by anyone, and will be entitled to
all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Notes of the same series or class duly issued hereunder.

          (e) The provisions of this Section are exclusive and will preclude
(to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

          SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

          (a) Unless otherwise provided with respect to such Note pursuant to
Section 301, interest payable on any Registered Note will be paid to the
Person in whose name that Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is
registered at the close of business on the most recent Record Date and
interest payable on any Bearer Note will be paid to the bearer of that Note
(or the applicable coupon).

          (b) Subject to paragraph (a), each Note delivered under this
Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note
will carry the rights to interest accrued or principal accreted and unpaid,
and to accrue or accrete, which were carried by such other Note.

          SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners. The Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Beneficiary and any agent of the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, or the Beneficiary may treat the Person
who is proved to be the owner of such Note pursuant to Section 104(c) as the
owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and

not described in clause (i) above (other than those described in clause (c) of
the definition thereof) in the State of New York separate and apart from all
other property held by the Indenture Trustee; and (iii) cause each Permitted
Investment described in clause (c) of the definition thereof to be registered
in the name of the Indenture Trustee by the issuer thereof; provided that,

expenses) on funds on deposit in the Collection Account will be deposited into
the Collection Account when the related Permitted Investments mature and are
available and, for purposes of Section 501, will be treated as part of
Interest Collections for the Monthly Period in which the investment was made.
Unless otherwise stated in the related Indenture Supplement, for purposes of
determining the availability of funds or the balance in the Accounts for any
reason under this Indenture or any Indenture Supplement, investment earnings
on such funds shall be deemed not to be available or on deposit.

          (e) Subject to Section 801(c), the Indenture Trustee will not in any
way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in such Accounts resulting
from any loss on any Permitted Investment included therein except for losses
attributable to the Indenture Trustee's failure to make payments on such
Permitted Investments issued by the Indenture Trustee, in its commercial
capacity, in accordance with their terms.

          (f) Funds on deposit in the Accounts will be invested and reinvested

the Indenture Trustee will from time to time determine, but only in one or
more Permitted Investments, upon the occurrence of any of the following
events:

subject to Article V and the allocation, deposits and payment sections of the
related Indenture Supplement.

          (b) If an Event of Default described in clause (c) or (f) (if the
Event of Default under clause (c) or (f) is with respect to all series and
classes of Notes then Outstanding) of Section 701 occurs and is continuing,
then and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Notes
shall have already become due and payable, either the Indenture Trustee or the
Majority Holders of all the Notes then Outstanding hereunder (treated as one
class), by notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Indenture Trustee if
given by Holders), may declare the Outstanding principal amount of all the
Notes then Outstanding and all interest accrued or principal accreted and
unpaid (if any) thereon to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such
declaration the same will become and will be immediately due and payable,
notwithstanding anything in this Indenture, the related Indenture Supplements
or the Notes to the contrary.

          (c) If an Event of Default described in clause (d) or (e) of Section
701 occurs and is continuing, then the Notes of all series and classes will
automatically be and become



                                      42
<PAGE>



immediately due and payable by the Issuer, without notice or demand to any
Person, and the Issuer will automatically and immediately be obligated to pay
off the Notes.

          (d) At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been
made with respect to the Notes of any series or class and before a judgment or
decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee
as hereinafter in this Article VII provided, the Majority Holders of such
series or classes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

               (x) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Indenture Trustee
     a sum sufficient to pay (i) all overdue installments of interest on the
     Notes of such series or class, (ii) the principal of any Notes of such
     series or class which have become due otherwise than by such declaration
     of acceleration, and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed
     therefor by the terms of the Notes of such series or class, to the extent
     that payment of such interest is lawful, (iii) interest upon overdue
     installments of interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor by the
     terms of the Notes of such series or class to the extent that payment of
     such interest is lawful, and (iv) all sums paid by the Indenture Trustee
     hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of
     the Indenture Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due
     the Indenture Trustee under Section 807; and

               (y) all Events of Default with respect to such series or class
     of Notes, other than the nonpayment of the principal of the Notes of such
     series or class which has become due solely by such acceleration, have
     been cured or waived as provided in Section 716.

          No such rescission will affect any subsequent default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

          SECTION 703. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by
Indenture Trustee. The Issuer covenants that if:

          (a) the Issuer defaults in the payment of interest on any series or
class of Notes when such interest becomes due and payable and such default
continues for a period of five (5) Business Days following the date on which
such interest became due and payable, or

          (b) the Issuer defaults in the payment of the principal of any
series or class of Notes at the Legal Maturity Date thereof,

and any such default continues beyond any specified grace period provided with
respect to such series or class of Notes, the Issuer will, upon demand of the
Indenture Trustee, pay (subject to the allocation provided in Article V, this
Article VII and any related Indenture Supplement) to the Indenture Trustee,
for the benefit of the Holders of any such Notes of the affected series or
class, the whole amount then due and payable on any such Notes for principal
and interest, with interest, to the extent that payment of such interest will
be legally enforceable, upon the overdue principal and upon overdue
installments of interest, (i) in the case of Interest-bearing Notes, at the
rate of interest applicable to the stated principal amount thereof, unless
otherwise specified in the applicable Indenture Supplement; and (ii) in the
case of Discount Notes, as specified in the



                                      43
<PAGE>



applicable Indenture Supplement, and in addition thereto, will pay such
further amount as will be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other
amounts due the Indenture Trustee under Section 807.

          If the Issuer fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand,
the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may
institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and
unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce the same against the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes of
such series or class and collect the money adjudged or decreed to be payable
in the manner provided by law out of the Collateral or any other obligor upon
such Notes, wherever situated.

          SECTION 704. Indenture Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes or the
property of the Issuer or of such other obligor or their creditors, the
Indenture Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes will
then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise
and irrespective of whether the Indenture Trustee will have made any demand on
the Issuer for the payment of overdue principal or interest) will be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise,

               (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal
     and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes and to file such
     other papers or documents as may be necessary and advisable in order to
     have the claims of the Indenture Trustee (including any claim for the
     reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
     Indenture Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due the
     Indenture Trustee under Section 807) and of the Noteholders allowed in
     such judicial proceeding, and

               (ii) to collect and receive any funds or other property payable
     or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other
similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Noteholder to make such payment to the Indenture Trustee and in the event that
the Indenture Trustee will consent to the making of such payments directly to
the Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture Trustee any amount due to it for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Indenture
Trustee under Section 807.

          Nothing herein contained will be deemed to authorize the Indenture
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Noteholder any plan or reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the
Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any
such proceeding.

          SECTION 705. Indenture Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession
of Notes. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes of
any series or class



                                      44
<PAGE>



may be prosecuted and enforced by the Indenture Trustee without the possession
of any of the Notes of such series or class or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the
Indenture Trustee will be brought in its own name as trustee of an express
trust, and any recovery of judgment will, after provision for the payment of
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Indenture Trustee, its agent and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the
Holders of the Notes of the series or class in respect of which such judgment
has been recovered.

          SECTION 706. Application of Money Collected. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 707, any money or other property collected by the
Indenture Trustee with respect to a series or class of Notes pursuant to this
Article VII will be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed
by the Indenture Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on
account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the Notes of such
series or class and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid
and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

          (a) first, to the payment of all amounts due the Indenture Trustee
under Section 807(a);

          (b) second, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon
the Notes of that series or class for principal and interest, in respect of
which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably,
without preference or priority of any kind (but subject to the allocation
provided in Article V of this Indenture and the related Indenture
Supplements), according to the amounts due and payable on such Notes for
principal and interest, respectively; and

          (c) third, to the Issuer.

          SECTION 707. Continued Application of Collections Pursuant to
Regular Distribution Provisions. Following an acceleration of any series or
class of Notes and subject to Section 708, the Indenture Trustee will continue
to apply Interest Collections, Principal Collections and any other amounts
received on the Collateral (other than any proceeds from a sale of Receivables
in connection with the exercise of the Put Feature) in accordance with the
regular distribution provisions pursuant to Article V of this Indenture,
except that principal will be paid on the accelerated series or class of Notes
to the extent funds are received and allocated to the accelerated series or
class, and payment is permitted by the subordination provisions, if any, of
the accelerated series or class.

          SECTION 708. Sale of Receivables for Accelerated Notes. In the case
of a series or class of Notes that has been accelerated following an Event of
Default, if the Put Feature of such series or class of Notes has been deemed
to be exercised as provided in the related Indenture Supplement, the Indenture
Trustee will sell Principal Receivables and the related Non-Principal
Receivables (or interests therein) as provided in such Indenture Supplement.



                                      45

          SECTION 709. Noteholders Have the Right to Direct the Time, Method
and Place of Conducting Any Proceeding for Any Remedy Available to the
Indenture Trustee. The Majority Holders of any accelerated series or class of
Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee, in respect of such
series or class. This right may be exercised only if the direction provided by
the Noteholders does not conflict with applicable law or this Indenture and
does not have a substantial likelihood of involving the Indenture Trustee in
personal liability.

          SECTION 710. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Note of any
series or class will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

          (a) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Indenture
Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to Notes of such series
or class;

          (b) the Holders of not less than 25% in Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of the Outstanding Notes of such series or class have made written
request to the Indenture Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such
Event of Default in its own name as Indenture Trustee hereunder;

          (c) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Indenture Trustee
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;

          (d) the Indenture Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of
such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
proceeding; and

          (e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Indenture Trustee during such sixty (60) day period by the
Majority Holders of such series or class;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Notes of such
series or class will have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by
availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice
the rights of any other Holders of Notes of such series or class, or to obtain
or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other such Holders or to
enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided
and for the equal and proportionate benefit of all the Holders of all Notes of
such series or class.

          SECTION 711. Unconditional Right of Noteholders to Receive Principal
and Interest; Limited Recourse. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
Indenture, the Holder of any Note will have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such
Note on the Legal Maturity Date expressed in the related Indenture Supplement
and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right
will not be impaired without the consent of such Holder; provided, however,
that notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary,
the obligation to pay principal of or interest on the Notes or any other
amount payable to any Noteholder will be



                                      46
<PAGE>



without recourse to DCWR, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or any
affiliate, officer, employee or director of any of them, and the obligation of
the Issuer to pay principal of or interest on the Notes or any other amount
payable to any Noteholder will be subject to Article V and the allocation and
payment provisions of the Indenture Supplements.

          SECTION 712. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Indenture
Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right
or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders will, subject to any determination in
such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former
positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders will continue as though no such proceeding had
been instituted.

          SECTION 713.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy
herein conferred upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the
Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and
every right and remedy will, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and
in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or
employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, will not prevent
the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or
remedy.

          SECTION 714.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission
of the Indenture Trustee or of any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or
remedy accruing upon any Event of Default will impair any such right or remedy
or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the
Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time,
and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the
Noteholders, as the case may be.

          SECTION 715. Control by Noteholders. The Majority Holders of any
series or class will have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect
to the Notes of such series or class; provided that:

          (a) the Indenture Trustee will have the right to decline to follow
any such direction if the Indenture Trustee, being advised by counsel,
determines that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken or would
conflict with this Indenture or if the Indenture Trustee in good faith will,
by an Indenture Trustee Authorized Officer, determine that the proceedings so
directed would involve it in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to
the Holders not taking part in such direction, and

          (b) the Indenture Trustee may take any other action permitted
hereunder deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee which is not inconsistent
with such direction.

          SECTION 716. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Majority Holders of any
series or class may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes of such series
or class waive any past default



                                      47
<PAGE>



hereunder or under the related Indenture Supplement with respect to such
series or class and its consequences, except a default not theretofore cured:

          (a) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note of
such series or class, or

          (b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
X cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Note of such series or class.

          Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for
every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver will extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

          SECTION 717. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture
agree, and each Holder of any Note by his acceptance thereof will be deemed to
have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the
enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit
against the Indenture Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as
Indenture Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its
discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the
merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant;
but the provisions of this Section will not apply to any suit instituted by
the Indenture Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of
Noteholders, holding in the aggregate more than 25% in Outstanding Dollar
Principal Amount of the Outstanding Notes of any series or class to which the
suit relates, or to any suit instituted by any Noteholders for the enforcement
of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note on or after the
applicable Legal Maturity Date expressed in such Note.

          SECTION 718. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Issuer covenants
(to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist
upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time
hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this
Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby
expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that
it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted
to the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every
such power as though no such law had been enacted.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                             THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

          SECTION 801. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

          (a) The Indenture Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only
such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture with respect to
the Notes of any series or



                                      48
<PAGE>



classes, and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into this
Indenture against the Indenture Trustee.

          (b) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee
may, with respect to Notes of any series or class, conclusively rely, as to
the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and
conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such
certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically
required to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee will
be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform
to the requirements of this Indenture but need not confirm or investigate the
accuracy of any mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein.

          (c) In case an Event of Default with respect to any series or class
of Notes has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee will exercise
with respect to the Notes of such series or class such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise, as a fiduciary would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

          (d) No provision of this Indenture will be construed to relieve the
Indenture Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

               (i) this paragraph (d) will not be construed to limit the
     effect of paragraph (a) of this Section;

               (ii) the Indenture Trustee will not be liable for any error of
     judgment made in good faith by an Indenture Trustee Authorized Officer,
     unless it will be proved that the Indenture Trustee was negligent in
     ascertaining the pertinent facts;

               (iii) the Indenture Trustee will not be liable with respect to
     any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
     with the direction of the Majority Holders of any series or class
     relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
     any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or
     power conferred upon the Indenture Trustee, under this Indenture with
     respect to the Notes of such series or class; and

               (iv) no provision of this Indenture will require the Indenture
     Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
     liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the
     exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it will have reasonable
     grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity
     satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee against such risk or liability is
     not reasonably assured to it.

          (e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of
this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Indenture Trustee will be subject to the
provisions of this Section.



                                      49
<PAGE>



          SECTION 802. Notice of Defaults. Within ninety (90) days after the
occurrence of any default hereunder known to the Indenture Trustee with
respect to Notes of any series or class,

          (a) the Indenture Trustee will transmit by mail to all Registered
Noteholders of such series or class, as their names and addresses appear in
the Note Register, notice of such default hereunder,

          (b) the Indenture Trustee will notify all Holders of Bearer Notes of
such series or class, by publication of notice of such default in an
Authorized Newspaper, or as otherwise provided in the applicable Indenture
Supplement, and

          (c) the Indenture Trustee will give prompt written notification
thereof to the Note Rating Agencies, unless such default will have been cured
or waived;

provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the
principal of or interest on any Note of such series or class, the Indenture
Trustee will be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the
board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors
and/or Indenture Trustee Authorized Officers of the Indenture Trustee in good
faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the
Noteholders of such series or class. For the purpose of this Section, the term
"default," with respect to Notes of any series or class, means any event which
is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default
with respect to Notes of such series or class.

          SECTION 803. Certain Rights of Indenture Trustee. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 801:

          (a) the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely and will be
protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document (whether
in its original or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

          (b) any request or direction of the Issuer mentioned herein will be
sufficiently evidenced by an Officer's Certificate;

          (c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Indenture
Trustee will deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established before
taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Indenture Trustee
(unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence
of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officer's Certificate;

          (d) the Indenture Trustee may consult with counsel of its own
selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel will be
full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

          (e) the Indenture Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or
direction of any of the



                                      50
<PAGE>



Noteholders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Noteholders shall have
offered to the Indenture Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory
to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by
it in compliance with such request or direction;

          (f) the Indenture Trustee will not be bound to make any
investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Indenture Trustee,
in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such
facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Indenture Trustee will
determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it will be entitled
to examine the books, records and premises of the Issuer, personally or by
agent or attorney, at the expense of the Issuer;

          (g) the Indenture Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through
agents or attorneys and the Indenture Trustee will not be responsible for any
misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with
due care by it hereunder;

          (h) the Indenture Trustee will not be responsible for filing any
financing statements or continuation statements in connection with the Notes,
but will cooperate with the Issuer in connection with the filing of such
financing statements or continuation statements;

          (i) in no event shall the Indenture Trustee be responsible or liable
for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the
Indenture Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage
and regardless of the form of action; and

          (j) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits
given to the Indenture Trustee, including its right to be indemnified, are
extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Indenture Trustee in each of its
capacities hereunder.

          SECTION 804. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Notes. The
recitals contained herein and in the Notes, except the certificates of
authentication, will be taken as the statements of the Issuer, and the
Indenture Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The
Indenture Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency
of this Indenture or of the Notes. The Indenture Trustee will not be
accountable for the use or application by the Issuer of Notes or the proceeds
thereof.

          SECTION 805. May Hold Notes. The Indenture Trustee, any Paying
Agent, the Note Registrar or any other agent of the Issuer, in its individual
or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and, subject
to Sections 808 and 813, may otherwise deal with the Issuer with the same
rights it would have if it were not Indenture Trustee, Paying Agent, Note
Registrar or such other agent.

          SECTION 806. Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Indenture
Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by law. The Indenture Trustee will be under no liability
for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed
with the Issuer.

          SECTION 807. Compensation and Reimbursement, Limit on Compensation,
Reimbursement and Indemnity.

          (a) The Issuer agrees:

               (i) to pay to the Indenture Trustee from time to time
     reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which
     compensation will not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
     compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

               (ii) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to
     reimburse the Indenture Trustee upon its request for all reasonable
     expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Indenture
     Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the
     reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of
     its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance
     as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and

               (iii) to indemnify the Indenture Trustee for, and to hold it
     harmless against, any and all loss, liability or expense incurred without
     negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with
     the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and
     expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability (whether
     asserted by the Issuer, the Servicer, any Holder or any other Person) in
     connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or
     duties hereunder.

The Indenture Trustee will have no recourse to any asset of the Issuer other
than funds available pursuant to Section 706 or to any Person other than the
Servicer or the Issuer.

          (b) This Section will survive the termination of this Indenture and
the resignation or replacement of the Indenture Trustee under Section 810.

          SECTION 808. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests. If the
Indenture Trustee has or will acquire a conflicting interest within the
meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Indenture Trustee will, if so required
by the Trust Indenture Act, either eliminate such interest or resign, to the
extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the
Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. Nothing herein will prevent the
Indenture Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to
in the second to last paragraph of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

          SECTION 809. Corporate Indenture Trustee Required; Eligibility.
There will at all times be an Indenture Trustee hereunder with respect to each
series or class of Notes, which will be a corporation organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State,
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, subject to supervision
or examination by Federal or State authority, and having a rating of at least
BBB- by Standard & Poor's. If such corporation publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such corporation will be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. The Issuer



                                      52
<PAGE>



may not, nor may any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by,
or under common control with the Issuer, serve as Indenture Trustee. If at any
time the Indenture Trustee with respect to any series or class of Notes will
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it
will resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter
specified in this Article.

          SECTION 810. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

          (a) No resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee and no
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Article will
become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor
Indenture Trustee under Section 811.

          (b) The Indenture Trustee may resign with respect to any series or
class of Notes at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Issuer. If
an instrument of acceptance by a successor Indenture Trustee shall not have
been delivered to the Indenture Trustee within thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Indenture Trustee may
petition, at the expense of the Issuer, any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee.

          (c) The Indenture Trustee may be removed with respect to any series
or class of Notes at any time by Act of the Majority Holders of that series or
class, delivered to the Indenture Trustee and to the Issuer. If an instrument
of acceptance by a successor Indenture Trustee shall not have been delivered
to the Indenture Trustee within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice of
removal, the removed Indenture Trustee may petition, at the expense of the
Issuer, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Indenture Trustee.

          (d) If at any time:

               (i) the Indenture Trustee fails to comply with Section 310(b)
     of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any series or class of Notes
     after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Noteholder who has
     been a bona fide Holder of a Note of that series or class for at least
     six (6) months, or

               (ii) the Indenture Trustee ceases to be eligible under Section
     809 with respect to any series or class of Notes and fails to resign
     after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any such Noteholder,
     or

               (iii) the Indenture Trustee becomes incapable of acting with
     respect to any series or class of Notes, or

(iv)     the Indenture Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver
         of the Indenture Trustee or of its property is appointed or any
         public officer takes charge or control of the Indenture Trustee or of
         its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
         conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (A) the Issuer may remove the Indenture Trustee, with
respect to the series or class, or in the case of clause (iv), with respect to
all series or classes, or (B) subject to Section 717, any Noteholder who has
been a bona fide Holder of a Note of such series, class and



                                      53
<PAGE>



class for at least six (6) months may, on behalf of itself and all others
similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Indenture Trustee with respect to such series or class and the
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee with respect to the series or
class, or, in the case of clause (iv), with respect to all series and classes.

          (e) If the Indenture Trustee resigns, is removed or becomes
incapable of acting with respect to any series or class of Notes, or if a
vacancy shall occur in the office of the Indenture Trustee with respect to any
series or class of Notes for any cause, the Issuer will promptly appoint a
successor Indenture Trustee for that series or class of Notes. If, within one
year after such resignation, removal or incapacity, or the occurrence of such
vacancy, a successor Indenture Trustee with respect to such series or class of
Notes is appointed by Act of the Majority Holders of such series or class
delivered to the Issuer and the retiring Indenture Trustee, the successor
Indenture Trustee so appointed will, forthwith upon its acceptance of such
appointment, become the successor Indenture Trustee with respect to such
series or class and supersede the successor Indenture Trustee appointed by the
Issuer with respect to such series or class. If no successor Indenture Trustee
with respect to such series or class shall have been so appointed by the
Issuer or the Noteholders of such series or class and accepted appointment in
the manner hereinafter provided, any Noteholder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Note of that series or class for at least six (6) months may, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee
with respect to such series or class.

          (f) The Issuer will give written notice of each resignation and each
removal of the Indenture Trustee with respect to any series or class and each
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee with respect to any series or
class to each Noteholder as provided in Section 106 and to each Note Rating
Agency. Each notice will include the name of the successor Indenture Trustee
and the address of its principal Corporate Trust Office.

          SECTION 811. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. Every successor
Indenture Trustee appointed hereunder will execute, acknowledge and deliver to
the Issuer and to the predecessor Indenture Trustee an instrument accepting
such appointment, with a copy to the Note Rating Agencies, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor Indenture Trustee will become
effective with respect to any series or class as to which it is resigning or
being removed as Indenture Trustee, and such successor Indenture Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, will become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Indenture Trustee with
respect to any such series or class; but, on request of the Issuer or the
successor Indenture Trustee, such predecessor Indenture Trustee will, upon
payment of its reasonable charges, if any, execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to such successor Indenture Trustee all the rights, powers and
trusts of the predecessor Indenture Trustee, and will duly assign, transfer
and deliver to such successor Indenture Trustee all property and money held by
such predecessor Indenture Trustee hereunder with respect to all or any such
series or class, subject nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in
Section 807. Upon request of any such successor Indenture Trustee, the Issuer
will execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in
and confirming to such successor Indenture Trustee all such rights, powers and
trusts.



                                      54
<PAGE>



          In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Indenture
Trustee with respect to the Notes of one or more (but not all) series or
classes, the Issuer, the predecessor Indenture Trustee and each successor
Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes of any applicable series or class
will execute and deliver an Indenture Supplement which will contain such
provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Indenture Trustee with
respect to the Notes of any series or class as to which the predecessor
Indenture Trustee is not being succeeded will continue to be vested in the
predecessor Indenture Trustee, and will add to or change any of the provisions
of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the
administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Indenture Trustee, it
being understood that nothing herein or in such Indenture Supplement will
constitute such Indenture Trustees co- trustees of the same trust and that
each such Indenture Trustee will be Indenture Trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered
by any other such Indenture Trustee.

          No successor Indenture Trustee with respect to any series or class
of Notes will accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance
such successor Indenture Trustee will be qualified and eligible with respect
to that series or class under this Article.

          SECTION 812. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to
Business. Any corporation into which the Indenture Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Indenture Trustee
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of
the corporate trust business of the Indenture Trustee, will be the successor
of the Indenture Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be
otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto. The Issuer will give prompt written notice of such merger, conversion,
consolidation or succession to the Note Rating Agencies. In case any Notes
shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Indenture Trustee
then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such
authenticating Indenture Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the
Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Indenture
Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes.

          SECTION 813. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Issuer. If
and when the Indenture Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Issuer (or
any other obligor upon the Notes), the Indenture Trustee will be subject to
the provisions of Section 311 of the Trust Indenture Act. An Indenture Trustee
who has resigned or been removed will be subject to Section 311(a) of the
Trust Indenture Act to the extent provided therein.

          SECTION 814. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. At any time when
any of the Notes remain Outstanding, the Indenture Trustee, with the approval
of the Issuer, may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to
one or more series or classes of Notes which will be authorized to act on
behalf of the Indenture Trustee to authenticate Notes of such series or
classes issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption
thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Notes so authenticated will be
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and will be valid and obligatory
for all purposes as if authenticated by the Indenture Trustee hereunder.
Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and
delivery of Notes by the Indenture Trustee or the Indenture Trustee's
certificate of



                                      55
<PAGE>



authentication, such reference will be deemed to include authentication and
delivery on behalf of the Indenture Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a
certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Indenture Trustee by
an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent will be acceptable to the
Issuer and will at all times be a corporation organized and doing business
under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the
District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as an Authenticating
Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and,
if other than the Issuer itself, subject to supervision or examination by
Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent will be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent will cease to
be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such
Authenticating Agent will resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
specified in this Section. The initial Authenticating Agent for the Notes of
all series and classes will be the Indenture Trustee.

          Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating
Agent will be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency
or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, will continue to be an
Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation will be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of the Indenture Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

          An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Indenture Trustee and to the Issuer. The Indenture
Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Issuer.
Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in
case at any time such Authenticating Agent will cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Indenture Trustee, with
the approval of the Issuer, may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which
will be acceptable to the Issuer and will give notice to each Noteholder as
provided in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of
its appointment hereunder will become vested with all the rights, powers and
duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named
as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent will be
appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

          The Indenture Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent
(other than an Authenticating Agent appointed at the request of the Issuer
from time to time) reasonable compensation for its services under this
Section, and the Indenture Trustee will be entitled to be reimbursed for such
payments, subject to the provisions of Section 807.

          If an appointment with respect to one or more series or classes is
made pursuant to this Section, the Notes of such series or classes may have
endorsed thereon, in addition to the Indenture Trustee's certificate of
authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following
form:



                                      56
<PAGE>



                  This is one of the Notes of the series or classes designated
                  therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

                             The Bank of New York,
                             as Indenture Trustee



                             By:   _________________________
                                   As Authenticating Agent


                             By:   _________________________
                                   Authorized Signatory

          SECTION 815. Tax Returns. In the event the Issuer shall be required
to file tax returns, the Servicer shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared
such tax returns and shall provide such tax returns to the Owner Trustee or
the Beneficiary for signature at least five (5) days before such tax returns
are due to be filed. The Issuer, in accordance with the terms of each
Indenture Supplement, shall also prepare or shall cause to be prepared all tax
information required by law to be distributed to Noteholders and shall deliver
such information to the Indenture Trustee at least five (5) days prior to the
date it is required by law to be distributed to Noteholders. The Indenture
Trustee, upon written request, will furnish the Servicer with all such
information known and available to the Indenture Trustee as may be reasonably
requested and required in connection with the preparation of all tax returns
of the Issuer. In no event shall the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee be
personally liable for any liabilities, costs or expenses of the Issuer or any
Noteholder arising under any tax law, including federal, state or local income
or excise taxes or any other tax imposed on or measured by income (or any
interest or penalty with respect thereto arising from a failure to comply
therewith).

            SECTION 816. Representations and Covenants of the Indenture
Trustee. The Indenture Trustee represents, warrants and covenants that:

               (i) The Indenture Trustee is a banking corporation duly
     organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of New York;

               (ii) The Indenture Trustee has full power and authority to
     deliver and perform this Indenture and has taken all necessary action to
     authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Indenture
     and othier documents to which it is a party; and

               (iii) Each of this Indenture and other documents to which it is
     a party has been duly executed and delivered by the Indenture Trustee and
     constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation in accordance with
     its terms.

            SECTION 817. Custody of the Collateral. As provided for in Section
1119(g) hereof and Section 3.03(e) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Servicer as custodian for the Issuer shall have in its possession all original
copies of the contracts that constitute or evidence



                                      57
<PAGE>



the Receivables, and will hold all such contracts for the benefit of the
Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee shall hold such of the Collateral as
constitutes a Permitted Investment in accordance with Section 403(c). All
other Collateral that is not described in the preceding two sentences (i) that
constitutes investment property shall be held by the Indenture Trustee through
a securities intermediary, which securities intermediary shall agree with the
Indenture Trustee that (A) such investment property at all times shall be
credited to a securities account of the Indenture Trustee, (B) all property
credited to such securities account shall be treated as a financial asset, (C)
such securities intermediary shall treat the Indenture Trustee as entitled to
exercise the rights that comprise each financial asset credited to such
securities account, (D) such securities intermediary shall comply with
entitlement orders originated by the Indenture Trustee without the further
consent of any other person or entity, (E) such securities intermediary shall
not agree with any person or entity other than the Indenture Trustee to comply
with entitlement orders originated by any person or entity other than the
Indenture Trustee, (F) such securities account and all property credited
thereto shall not be subject to any lien, security interest, right of set-off,
or encumbrance in favor of such securities intermediary or anyone claiming
through such securities intermediary (other than the Indenture Trustee), and
(G) such agreement between such securities intermediary and the Indenture
Trustee shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and (ii) not
described in clause (i) above shall be held by the Indenture Trustee in the
State of New York separate and apart from all other property held by the
Indenture Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the
Indenture Trustee shall not hold any Collateral through an agent except as
expressly permitted by this Section 817 and Section 403(c). Each term used in
this Section 817 and defined in the New York UCC shall have the meaning set
forth in the New York UCC.

          SECTION 818. Indenture Trustee's Application for Instructions from
the Issuer. Any application by the Indenture Trustee for written instructions
from the Issuer may, at the option of the Indenture Trustee, set forth in
writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Indenture Trustee
under and in accordance with this Indenture and the date on and/or after which
such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective, provided that
such application shall make specific reference to this Section 818. The
Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of,
the Indenture Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such
application on or after the date specified in such application (which date
shall not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date any officer of
the Issuer actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall
have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such
action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Indenture
Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such

                                  ARTICLE IX

                   NOTEHOLDERS' MEETINGS, LISTS, REPORTS BY
                   INDENTURE TRUSTEE, ISSUER AND BENEFICIARY

          SECTION 901. Issuer to Furnish Indenture Trustee Names and Addresses
of Noteholders. The Issuer will furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Indenture Trustee:

          (a) not more than fifteen (15) days after each Record Date, in each
year in such form as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably require, a list of
the names and addresses of the Registered Noteholders of such series or
classes as of such date, and

          (b) at such other times as the Indenture Trustee may request in
writing, within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Issuer of any such
request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than fifteen
(15) days before the time such list is furnished; provided, however, that so
long as the Indenture Trustee is the Note Registrar, no such list shall be
required to be furnished.

          SECTION 902. Preservation of Information; Communications to
Noteholders.

          (a) The Indenture Trustee will preserve, in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Registered Noteholders
contained in the most recent list furnished to the Indenture Trustee as
provided in Section 901 and the names and addresses of Registered Noteholders
received by the Indenture Trustee in its capacity as Note Registrar. The
Indenture Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section
901 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.

          (b) If three (3) or more Holders of Notes of any series or class
(hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Indenture
Trustee, and furnish to the Indenture Trustee reasonable proof that each such
applicant has owned a Note of such series or class for a period of at least
six (6) months preceding the date of such application, and such application
states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Notes
of such series or class or with the Holders of all Notes with respect to their
rights under this Indenture or under such Notes and is accompanied by a copy
of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to
transmit, then the Indenture Trustee will, within five (5) Business Days after
the receipt of such application, at its election, either

                    (i) afford such applicants access to the information
          preserved at the time by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with
          Section 902(a), or

                    (ii) such applicants as to the approximate number of
          Holders of Notes of such series or class or all Notes, as the case
          may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved
          at the time by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with Section
          902(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Noteholders
          the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such
          application.

          If the Indenture Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants
access to such information, the Indenture Trustee shall, upon the written
request of such applicants, mail to each



                                      59
<PAGE>



Holder of a Registered Note of such series or class or to all Registered
Noteholders, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the
information preserved at the time by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with
Section 902(a), a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is
specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the
Indenture Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision
for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless, within five
(5) days after such tender, the Indenture Trustee shall mail to such
applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material
to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the
Indenture Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the
Holders of Notes of such series or class or all Noteholders, as the case may
be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement will
specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a
hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall
enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the
entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission
shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections
so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the
Indenture Trustee will mail copies of such material to all Registered
Noteholders of such series or class or all Registered Noteholders, as the case
may be, with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the
renewal of such tender; otherwise the Indenture Trustee will be relieved of

satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to any series or
class of Notes or for any other purpose, pay, or by an Officer's Certificate
direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Issuer or such Paying Agent in respect of each and every series
or class of Notes as to which it seeks to discharge this Indenture or, if for
any other purpose, all sums so held in trust by the Issuer in respect of all
Notes, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee upon the same trusts as
those upon which such sums were held by the Issuer or such Paying



                                      69

Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Indenture Trustee,
such Paying Agent will be released from all further liability with respect to
such money.

          Any money deposited with the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent,
or then held by the Issuer, in trust for the payment of the principal of or
interest on any Note of any series or class and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal or interest has become due and payable will be paid
to the Issuer upon request in an Officer's Certificate, or (if then held by
the Issuer) will be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note
will thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying
Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as
trustee thereof, will thereupon cease. The Indenture Trustee or such Paying
Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of
the Issuer give notice to the Holders of the Notes as to which the money to be
repaid was held in trust, as provided in Section 106, a notice that such funds
remain unclaimed and that, after a date specified in the notice, which will
not be less than thirty (30) days from the date on which the notice was first
mailed or published to the Holders of the Notes as to which the money to be
repaid was held in trust, any unclaimed balance of such funds then remaining
will be paid to the Issuer free of the trust formerly impressed upon it.

          The Issuer initially authorizes the Indenture Trustee to act as
Paying Agent for the Notes on its behalf. The Issuer may at any time and from
time to time authorize one or more Persons (including the Indenture Trustee)
to act as Paying Agent in addition to or in place of the Indenture Trustee
with respect to any series or class of Notes issued under this Indenture.

          Each Paying Agent will at all times have a combined capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000 and be subject to supervision or examination
by a United States Federal or State authority or be regulated by or subject to
the supervision or examination of a governmental authority of a nation that is
member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. If such
Paying Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law
or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of
such Paying Agent will be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set
forth in its most recent report of condition as so published.

          SECTION 1104. Statement as to Compliance. The Issuer will deliver to
the Indenture Trustee and the Note Rating Agencies, on or before April 1 of
each year, beginning in 2003, a written statement signed by an Issuer
Authorized Officer stating that:

          (a) a review of the activities of the Issuer during the prior year
and of the Issuer's performance under this Indenture and under the terms of
the Notes has been made under such Issuer Authorized Officer's supervision;
and

          (b) to the best of such Issuer Authorized Officer's knowledge, based
on such review, the Issuer has complied in all material respects with all
conditions and covenants under this Indenture throughout such year, or, if
there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such condition or covenant
(without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice), specifying each
such default known to such Issuer Authorized Officer and the nature and status
thereof.

Indenture Trustee or as necessary, the Issuer will execute and deliver such
further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or
proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Indenture.

          SECTION 1107. Compliance with Laws. The Issuer will comply with the
requirements of all applicable laws, the noncompliance with which would,
individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Notes or this Indenture.

          SECTION 1108. Notice of Events of Default. The Issuer agrees to give
the Indenture Trustee and the Note Rating Agencies prompt written notice of
each Event of Default hereunder and each default on the part of the Issuer,
the Servicer or the Seller of its respective obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement and any default of an Enhancement Provider.

          SECTION 1109. Certain Negative Covenants. The Issuer will not:

          (a) claim any credit on, or make any deduction from the principal or
interest payable in respect of, the Notes (other than amounts withheld in good
faith from such payments under the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable
tax law);

          (b) permit the validity or effectiveness of this Indenture to be
impaired, or permit the lien in favor of the Indenture Trustee, the
Noteholders and any applicable Enhancement Provider created by this Indenture
to be amended, hypothecated, subordinated, terminated or discharged, or permit
any Person to be released from any covenants or obligations with respect to
the Notes under this Indenture except as may be expressly permitted hereby;

          (c) permit any lien, charge, excise, claim, security interest,
mortgage or other encumbrance (other than the lien in favor of the Indenture
Trustee, the Noteholders and any applicable Enhancement Provider created by
this Indenture) to be created on or extend to or otherwise arise upon or
burden the Collateral or any part thereof or any interest therein or the
proceeds thereof; or

          (d) permit the lien in favor of the Indenture Trustee, the
Noteholders and any applicable Enhancement Provider created by this Indenture
not to constitute a valid first priority security interest in the Collateral;
or

          (e) voluntarily dissolve or liquidate.

          SECTION 1110. No Other Business. The Issuer will not engage in any
business other than as permitted under the Trust Agreement.

          SECTION 1111. No Borrowing. The Issuer will not issue, incur,
assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable, directly or indirectly, for any
indebtedness for borrowed money except for the Notes.

          SECTION 1112. Rule 144A Information. For so long as any of the Notes
of any series or class are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule
144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, the Issuer agrees to provide to any
Noteholder of such series or class and to any prospective purchaser of Notes
designated by such Noteholder, upon the request of such Noteholder or
prospective purchaser, any information required to be provided to such Holder
or prospective purchaser to satisfy the conditions set forth in Rule
144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

          SECTION 1113. Performance of Obligations.

          (a) The Issuer will not take any action and will use its best
efforts not to permit any action to be taken by others that would release any
Person from any of such Person's material covenants or obligations under any
instrument or agreement included in the Collateral or that would result in the
amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge of, or
impair the validity or effectiveness of, any such instrument or agreement,
except as expressly provided in this Indenture, the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Trust Agreement or such
other instrument or agreement.

          (b) The Issuer will punctually perform and observe all of its
obligations and agreements contained in this Indenture, any Indenture
Supplement, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Receivables Purchase
Agreement, the Trust Agreement and in the instruments and agreements relating
to the Collateral, including but not limited to filing or causing to be filed
all UCC financing statements and continuation statements required to be filed
by the terms of this Indenture, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Trust Agreement in accordance with and
within the time periods provided for herein and therein. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or therein, the Issuer shall not waive, amend,
modify, supplement or terminate this Indenture, any Indenture Supplement, the
Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the Trust
Agreement or any provision thereof without the consent of the Holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes of each
adversely affected series or class. The Issuer may contract with other Persons
to assist it in performing its duties under this Indenture, and any
performance of such duties by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in
an Officer's Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be action taken by
the Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the Administrator to
assist the Issuer in performing its duties under this Indenture.

          (c) Without derogating from the absolute nature of the assignment
granted to the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture or the rights of the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, the Issuer agrees (i) that it will not, without
the prior written consent of the Indenture Trustee and a majority in
Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes of each affected series or
class, amend, modify, waive, supplement, terminate or surrender, or agree to
any amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or surrender of,
the terms of any Collateral (except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Indenture, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the

waiver, supplement, termination or surrender shall not (A) increase or reduce
in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, collections
of payments on the Receivables or distributions that are required to be made
for the benefit of the Noteholders or (B) reduce the aforesaid percentage of
the Notes that is required to consent to any such amendment, modification,
waiver, supplement, termination or surrender without the consent of the
Holders of all the Outstanding Notes. If any such amendment, modification,
waiver, supplement, termination or surrender shall be so consented to by the
Indenture Trustee and such Noteholders, the Issuer agrees to execute and
deliver, in its own name and at its own expense, such agreements, instruments,
consents and other documents as are necessary or appropriate in the
circumstances.

          SECTION 1114. Issuer May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain

succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under this Indenture with the same effect as if such Person had
been named as the Issuer herein. In the event of any such conveyance or
transfer, the Person named as the Issuer in the first paragraph of this
Indenture or any successor which shall theretofore have become such in the
manner prescribed in this Section 1115 shall be released from its obligations
under this Indenture as issued immediately upon the effectiveness of such
conveyance or transfer, provided that the Issuer shall not be released from
any obligations or liabilities to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
arising prior to such effectiveness.

                                      75
<PAGE>



          (a) Except as may be expressly permitted herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, this Indenture creates a valid and continuing security
interest (as defined in the UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Indenture
Trustee, which security interest is prior to all other liens and security
interests, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and purchasers
from the Issuer.

          (b) The Receivables constitute "tangible chattel paper", "accounts"
or "payment intangibles" within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC.

          (c) The Issuer has taken all necessary steps to perfect its security
interest (if any) against account debtors on the Receivables in any property
securing the Receivables.

          (d) The Issuer owns and has good and marketable title to the
Receivables free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance of any Person
(other than the Indenture Trustee).

          (e) The Issuer has caused or will have caused, within ten days after
the date of execution of this Indenture, the filing of all appropriate
financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest
in the Receivables granted to the Issuer hereunder.

          (f) Other than the security interest granted to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to this Indenture, the Issuer has not pledged, assigned,
sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
Receivables . The Issuer has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of
any financing statements against the Issuer that include a description of
collateral covering the Receivables other than any financing statement
relating to the security interest granted to the Indenture Trustee hereunder
or that has been terminated. The Issuer is not aware of any judgment or tax
lien filings against it.

          (g) The Servicer as custodian for the Issuer has in its possession
all original copies of the contracts that constitute or evidence the
Receivables, and will hold all such contracts for the benefit of the Indenture
Trustee. The contracts that constitute or evidence the Receivables do not have
any marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or
otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Issuer. All financing
statements filed or to be filed against the Issuer in favor of the Indenture
Trustee in connection herewith and describing the Receivables contain a
statement to the following effect: "A purchase of or security interest in any
collateral described in this financing statement will violate the rights of
the Indenture Trustee."

          (h) The Issuer has received all consents and approvals (if any)
required by the terms of the Receivables to the grant of a security interest
in the Receivables hereunder to the Indenture Trustee.

          SECTION 1120. Derivative Instruments. If the Issuer enters into any
interest rate swap or derivative instrument (each, a "derivative instrument")
in connection with its issuance of a series of Notes, such derivative
instrument shall be entered into at the time of issuance of such series of
Notes, at the time of issuance shall not have a notional amount in excess of
the Stated Principal Amount of such Notes and is not thereafter expected to
exceed such Stated Principal Amount outstanding from time to time, shall not
require the Issuer to make



                                      76
<PAGE>



discretionary decisions (other than decisions relating to the servicing of the
Receivables) and shall have characteristics that relate to and are intended to
hedge (partly or fully) against some risk or risks related to such series of
Notes or the Receivables or Permitted Investments.

                                 ARTICLE XII

                           EARLY REDEMPTION OF NOTES

          SECTION 1201.Applicability of Article. Unless otherwise specified in
the applicable Indenture Supplement related to a series or class of Notes,
pursuant to the terms of this Article, the Issuer will redeem and pay,
provided that funds are available, each affected series or class of Notes upon
the occurrence of any Early Redemption Event. Unless otherwise specified in
the applicable Indenture Supplement relating to a series or class of Notes, or
in the form of Notes for such series or class, the following are "Early
Redemption Events":

          (a) with respect to any class of Notes, the occurrence of the
Expected Principal Payment Date of such Note;

          (b) the Issuer becomes an investment company within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act; or

          (c) with respect to any series or class of Notes, any additional
Early Redemption Event specified in the Indenture Supplement for such series
or class as applying to such series or class.

          The redemption price of a class of Notes so redeemed will equal the
Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of such series or class, plus interest
accrued and unpaid to but excluding the date of redemption, the payment of
which will be subject to Article V, Article VII and the allocations, deposits
and payments sections of the related Indenture Supplement.

          If the Issuer is unable to pay the redemption price in full on the
Payment Date following the end of the Monthly Period in which the Early
Redemption Event occurs, monthly payments on such series or class of Notes
will thereafter be made on each following Payment Date until the Outstanding
Dollar Principal Amount of such series or class, plus all accrued and unpaid
interest, is paid in full or the Legal Maturity Date occurs, whichever is
earlier, subject to Article V, Article VII and the allocations, deposits and
payments provisions of the related Indenture Supplement. Any funds in any
Supplemental Account for a redeemed class will be applied to make the
principal and interest payments on that series or class on the redemption
date, subject to Article V, Article VII and the allocations, deposits and
payments sections of the related Indenture Supplement. Principal payments on
redeemed classes will be made first to the senior-most Notes until paid in
full, then to the subordinated Notes, if any, until paid in full.

          SECTION 1202. Optional Repurchase. Unless otherwise provided in the
applicable Indenture Supplement for a series or class of Notes, the Servicer
has the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Issuer to redeem a series
or class of Notes in whole but not in part on any day on or after the day on
which the aggregate Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Notes of such series or
class is reduced to less than 10% of its Initial Dollar Principal Amount;
provided, however, that if such series or class of Notes is of a subordinated
class, the Servicer will not



                                      77
<PAGE>



cause the Issuer to redeem such Notes if the provisions of the related
Indenture Supplement would prevent the payment of such subordinated Note until
a level of prefunding of the principal funding sub-accounts for the senior
classes of Notes for that series has been reached such that the amount of such
deficiency in the required subordination of a senior class of Notes is no
longer required to provide subordination protection for the senior classes of
that series. If the Servicer elects to cause the Issuer to redeem a series or
class of Notes, it will cause the Issuer to notify the Holders of such
redemption at least thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date. The
redemption price of a series or class so redeemed will equal the Outstanding
Dollar Principal Amount of such class, plus interest accrued and unpaid or
principal accreted and unpaid on such class to but excluding the date of
redemption, the payment of which will be subject to Article V, Article VII and
the allocations, deposits and payments provisions of the related Indenture
Supplement.

          If the Servicer is unable to pay the redemption price in full on the
redemption date, monthly payments on such class of Notes will thereafter be
made until the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of such class, plus all
accrued and unpaid interest, is paid in full or the Legal Maturity Date
occurs, whichever is earlier, subject to Article V, Article VII and the
allocations, deposits and payments provisions of the related Indenture
Supplement. Any funds in any Supplemental Account for a redeemed class will be
applied to make the principal and interest payments on that class on the
redemption date in accordance with the related Indenture Supplement. Principal
payments on redeemed classes will be made in accordance with the related
Indenture Supplement.

          SECTION 1203. Notice. Promptly after the occurrence of any Early
Redemption Event or a redemption pursuant to Section 1202, the Issuer will
notify the Indenture Trustee and the Note Rating Agencies in writing of the
identity, Stated Principal Amount and Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of
the affected series or class of Notes to be redeemed. Notice of redemption
will promptly be given as provided in Section 106. All notices of redemption
will state (a) the date on which the redemption of the applicable series or
class of Notes pursuant to this Article will begin, which will be the
Principal Payment Date next following the end of the Monthly Period in which
the applicable Early Redemption Event or redemption pursuant to Section 1202
occurs, (b) the redemption price for such series or class of Notes, which will
be equal to the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of such series or class

of which will be subject to Article V, Article VII and the allocations,
deposits and payments provisions of the related Indenture Supplement and (c)

                                 ARTICLE XIII

                                  COLLATERAL

          SECTION 1301.Recording, Etc.

          (a) The Issuer intends the Security Interest granted pursuant to
this Indenture in favor of the Indenture Trustee to be prior to all other
liens in respect of the Collateral. Subject to Section 1303, the Issuer will
take all actions necessary to obtain and maintain a perfected lien



                                      78
<PAGE>



on and security interest in the Collateral in favor of the Indenture Trustee.
The Issuer will from time to time execute and deliver all such supplements and
amendments hereto and all such financing statements, continuation statements,
instruments of further assurance and other instruments, all as prepared by the
Issuer, and will take such other action necessary or advisable to:

               (i) grant a Security Interest more effectively in all or any
     portion of the Collateral;

               (ii) maintain or preserve the Security Interest (and the
     priority thereof) created by this Indenture or carry out more effectively
     the purposes hereof;

               (iii) perfect, publish notice of or protect the validity of any
     grant made or to be made by this Indenture;

               (iv) enforce the Receivables, the Enhancement Agreements and
     each other instrument or agreement included in the Collateral;

               (v) preserve and defend title to the Collateral and the rights
     of the Indenture Trustee in such Collateral against the claims of all
     persons and parties; or

               (vi) pay all taxes or assessments levied or assessed upon the
     Collateral when due.

          (b) The Issuer will from time to time promptly pay and discharge all
financing and continuation statement recording and/or filing fees, charges and
taxes relating to this Indenture, any amendments thereto and any other
instruments of further assurance. The Issuer hereby designates the Indenture
Trustee its agent and attorney-in-fact to execute upon the Issuer's failure to
do so, any financing statement, continuation statement or other instrument
required by and provided to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section.

          (c) Without limiting the generality of clauses (a)(ii) or (a)(iii):

               (i) The Issuer will cause this Indenture, all amendments and
     supplements hereto and/or all financing statements and continuation
     statements and any other necessary documents covering the Indenture
     Trustee's right, title and interest to the Collateral to be promptly
     recorded, registered and filed, and at all times to be kept, recorded,
     registered and filed, all in such manner and in such places as may be
     required by law fully to preserve and protect the right, title and
     interest of the Indenture Trustee to all property comprising the
     Collateral; it being understood and agreed that the parties hereto hereby
     authorize a financing statement or a financing statement amendment
     describing as collateral "all assets and all personal property of the
     Debtor whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than the
     Beneficiary Trust Account" and naming the Issuer as debtor and the
     Indenture Trustee as secured party to be filed by or on behalf of the
     Issuer in the applicable jurisdiction, which shall be the State of
     Delaware, within ten days of the Effective Date. The Issuer will deliver
     to the Indenture Trustee file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for,
     any document recorded, registered or filed as provided above, as soon as
     available following such recording, registration or filing.



                                      79
<PAGE>



               (ii) Within 30 days after the Issuer makes any change in its
     name, identity or corporate structure which would make any financing
     statement or continuation statement filed in accordance with paragraph
     (d)(i) seriously misleading within the meaning of Section 9-507 or 9-508
     (or any comparable provision) of the UCC, the Issuer will give the
     Indenture Trustee notice of any such change and will file such financing
     statements or amendments as may be necessary to continue the perfection
     of the Indenture Trustee's security interest in the Collateral.

          (d) The Issuer will give the Indenture Trustee prompt notice of any
relocation of its chief executive office, place of business or State of
location, and any change in the jurisdiction of its organization, and whether,
as a result of such relocation or change, the applicable provision of the UCC
would require the filing of any amendment of any previously filed financing or
continuation statement or of any new financing statement and will file such
financing statements or amendments as may be necessary to perfect or to
continue the perfection of the Indenture Trustee's security interest in the
Collateral. The Issuer will at all times maintain its chief executive office
within the United States.

          (e) The duty of the Indenture Trustee to execute any instrument
required pursuant to this Section will arise only if the Indenture Trustee has
knowledge of the type described in Section 701(c) of any default of the Issuer
in complying with the provisions of this Section.

          SECTION 1302. Trust Indenture Act Requirements. The release of any
Collateral from the lien created by this Indenture or the release of, in whole
or in part, such liens, will not be deemed to impair the Security Interest in
contravention of the provisions hereof if and to the extent the Collateral or
liens are released pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Sale and
Servicing Agreement or the Trust Agreement. The Indenture Trustee and each of
the Noteholders and any applicable Enhancement Provider acknowledge that a
release of Collateral or liens in accordance with the terms of this Indenture,
the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Trust Agreement will not be deemed for
any purpose to be an impairment of the Security Interest in contravention of
the terms of this Indenture. To the extent applicable, without limitation, the
Issuer and each other obligor on the Notes will cause Trust Indenture Act
Section 314(d) relating to the release of property or securities from the
liens hereof to be complied with. Any certificate or opinion required by Trust
Indenture Act Section 314(d) may be made by an officer of the appropriate
obligor, except in cases in which Trust Indenture Act Section 314(d) requires
that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent person.

          SECTION 1303. Suits to Protect the Collateral. Subject to the
provisions of this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee will have power to
institute and to maintain such suits and proceedings as it may deem expedient
to prevent any impairment of the Collateral by any acts which may be unlawful
or in violation of this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings as the
Indenture Trustee may deem expedient to preserve or protect the interests of
the Noteholders and any applicable Enhancement Provider and the interests of
the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes in the Collateral
(including power to institute and maintain suits or proceedings to restrain
the enforcement of or compliance with any legislative or other governmental
enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid if
the enforcement of, or compliance with, such enactment, rule or order would
impair the Security Interest or be



                                      80
<PAGE>



prejudicial to the interests of the Holders of the Notes or the Indenture
Trustee). No counterparties to an Enhancement Agreement may direct the
Indenture Trustee to enforce the Security Interest. Each Enhancement
Provider's rights consist solely of the right to receive collections allocated
for its benefit pursuant to the related Indenture Supplement.

          SECTION 1304. Purchaser Protected. In no event will any purchaser in
good faith of any property purported to be released hereunder be bound to
ascertain the authority of the Indenture Trustee to execute the release or to
inquire as to the satisfaction of any conditions required by the provisions
hereof for the exercise of such authority or to see to the application of any
consideration given by such purchaser or other transferee; nor will any
purchaser or other transferee of any property or rights permitted by this
Article to be sold be under any obligation to ascertain or inquire into the
authority of the Issuer or any other obligor, as applicable, to make any such
sale or other transfer.

          SECTION 1305. Powers Exercisable by Receiver or Trustee. In case the
Collateral shall be in the possession of a receiver or trustee, lawfully
appointed, the powers conferred in this Article upon the Issuer or any other
obligor, as applicable, with respect to the release, sale or other disposition
of such property may be exercised by such receiver or trustee, and an
instrument signed by such receiver or trustee shall be deemed the equivalent
of any similar instrument of the Issuer or any other obligor, as applicable,
or of any officer or officers thereof required by the provisions of this
Article.

          SECTION 1306. Determinations Relating to Collateral. In the event (i)
the Indenture Trustee shall receive any written request from the Issuer or any
other obligor for consent or approval with respect to any matter or thing
relating to any Collateral or the Issuer's or any other obligor's obligations
with respect thereto or (ii) there shall be due to or from the Indenture
Trustee under the provisions hereof any performance or the delivery of any
instrument or (iii) the Indenture Trustee shall become aware of any
nonperformance by the Issuer or any other obligor of any covenant or any
breach of any representation or warranty of the Issuer or any other obligor
set forth in this Indenture, then, in each such event, the Indenture Trustee
shall be entitled to hire experts, consultants, agents and attorneys to advise
the Indenture Trustee on the manner in which the Indenture Trustee should
respond to such request or render any requested performance or response to
such nonperformance or breach (the expenses of which will be reimbursed to
such experts, consultants, agents and attorneys and to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to Section 807). The Indenture Trustee will be fully protected in the
taking of any action recommended or approved by any such expert, consultant,
agent or attorney or agreed to by the Majority Holders of the Outstanding
Notes.

          SECTION 1307. Release of Collateral.

          (a) Subject to the payment of its fees and expenses pursuant to
Section 807, the Indenture Trustee will, at the request of the Issuer or when
otherwise required by the provisions of this Indenture or the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, execute instruments to release property from the lien of
this Indenture, or convey the Indenture Trustee's interest in the same, in a
manner and under circumstances which are not inconsistent with the provisions
of this Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement. No party relying upon
an instrument executed by the Indenture Trustee as provided in this Article
will be bound to ascertain the Indenture



                                      81
<PAGE>



Trustee's authority, inquire into the satisfaction of any conditions precedent
or see to the application of any funds.

          (b) Upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate certifying that the
Issuer's obligations under this Indenture have been satisfied and discharged
by complying with the provisions of this Article, the Indenture Trustee will
(i) execute and deliver such releases, termination statements and other
instruments (in recordable form, where appropriate) as the Issuer or any other
obligor, as applicable, may reasonably request evidencing the termination of
the Security Interest created by this Indenture and (ii) not to be deemed to
hold the Security Interest for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee, the
Noteholders and any applicable Enhancement Provider.

          (c) DCWR and the Noteholders will be entitled to receive at least
ten (10) days written notice when the Indenture Trustee proposes to take any
action pursuant to clause (a), accompanied by copies of any instruments
involved, and the Indenture Trustee will also be entitled to require, as a
condition to such action, an Opinion of Counsel, stating the legal effect of
any such action, outlining the steps required to complete the same, and
concluding that all conditions precedent to the taking of such action have
been complied with. Counsel rendering any such opinion may rely, without
independent investigation, on the accuracy and validity of any certificate or
other instrument delivered to the Indenture Trustee in connection with any
such action.

          SECTION 1308. Certain Actions by Indenture Trustee. Any action taken
by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Article in respect of the release of
Collateral will be taken by the Indenture Trustee as its interest in such
Collateral may appear, and no provision of this Article is intended to, or
will, excuse compliance with any provision hereof.

          SECTION 1309. Opinions as to Collateral.

          (a) On the Effective Date, the Issuer will furnish to the Indenture
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either stating that, in the opinion of such
counsel, such action has been taken with respect to the recording and filing
of this Indenture, any indentures supplemental hereto, and any other requisite
documents, and with respect to the execution and filing of any financing
statements and continuation statements, as are necessary to perfect and
maintain the perfection of the Security Interest in the Receivables and the
proceeds thereof granted by this Indenture in favor of the Indenture Trustee
and reciting the details of such action, or stating that, in the opinion of
such counsel, no such action is necessary to make such lien and security
interest perfected.

          (b) On or before March 31 in each calendar year, beginning in 2003,
the Issuer will furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel with
respect to each Uniform Commercial Code financing statement which has been
filed by the Issuer either stating that, (i) in the opinion of such counsel,
such action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording
and refiling of this Indenture, any indentures supplemental hereto and any
other requisite documents and with respect to the execution and filing of any
financing statements and continuation statements as is necessary to maintain
the first priority lien and Security Interest in the Receivables and the
proceeds thereof created by this Indenture and reciting the details of



                                      82
<PAGE>



such action or (ii) in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary
to maintain such lien and Security Interest. Such Opinion of Counsel will also
describe the recording, filing, re-recording and refiling of this Indenture,
any indentures supplemental hereto and any other requisite documents and the
execution and filing of any financing statements and continuation statements
that will, in the opinion of such counsel, be required to maintain the lien
and Security Interest of this Indenture until March 31 in the following
calendar year.

          SECTION 1310. Delegation of Duties. The Issuer may contract with or
appoint other Persons (including DCWR and its Affiliates) to assist it in
performing its duties under this Indenture, and any performance of such duties
by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an Officer's Certificate
will be deemed to be action taken by the Issuer.

                                 ARTICLE XIV

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 1401. No Petition. The Indenture Trustee, by entering into
this Indenture, each Enhancement Provider, by designating that the obligations
of the Issuer pursuant to the applicable Enhancement Agreement are secured by
the Collateral, and each Noteholder, by accepting a Note, agrees that it will
not at any time institute against DCWR, the CARCO Trust or the Issuer, or join
in any institution against DCWR, the CARCO Trust or the Issuer of, any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States Federal or state
bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the
Notes, this Indenture or any Enhancement Agreement.

          SECTION 1402. Trust Obligations. No recourse may be taken, directly
or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the Issuer on the Notes or
under this Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, against (i) the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or
(iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director, employee or
agent of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a
beneficial interest in the Issuer or the Owner Trustee or of any successor or
assign of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except as any such
Person may have expressly agreed (it being understood that the Owner Trustee
has no such obligations in its individual capacity).

          SECTION 1403. Limitations on Liability.

          (a) It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
(i) this Indenture is executed and delivered by the Beneficiary not
individually or personally but solely as Beneficiary, in the exercise of the
powers and authority conferred and vested in it, (ii) each of the
representations, undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of the
Issuer is made and intended not as a personal representation, undertaking or
agreement by the Beneficiary but is made and intended for the purpose of
binding only the Issuer, (iii) nothing herein contained will be construed as
creating any liability on the Beneficiary individually or personally, to
perform any covenant of the Issuer either expressed or implied contained
herein, all such liability, if any, being expressly waived by the parties to
this Indenture and by any Person claiming by, through or under them and (iv)
under no circumstances will the Beneficiary be personally liable for the

payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Issuer or be liable for the
breach or failure of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant made

          (b) None of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, DCWR, DCS or
any other beneficiary of the Issuer or any of their respective officers,
directors, employers or agents will have any liability with respect to this
Indenture, and recourse may be had solely to the Collateral pledged to secure
the Notes issued by the Issuer.

          SECTION 1404. Tax Treatment. The Issuer and the Noteholders agree
that the Notes are intended to be debt of DCWR for federal, state and local
income, franchise and single business tax purposes and agree to treat the
Notes accordingly for all such purposes, unless otherwise required by a taxing
authority.

          SECTION 1405. Actions Taken by the Issuer. Any and all actions that
are to be taken by the Issuer may be taken by either the Beneficiary or the
Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer.

          SECTION 1406. Alternate Payment Provisions. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Indenture or any of the Notes to the contrary, the Issuer,
with the written consent of the Indenture Trustee, may enter into any
agreement with any Holder of a Note providing for a method of payment or
notice that is different from the methods provided for in this Indenture for
such payments or notices. The Issuer will furnish to the Indenture Trustee a
copy of each such agreement and the Indenture Trustee will cause payments or
notices, as applicable, to be made in accordance with such agreements.

          SECTION 1407. Termination of Issuer. The Issuer and the respective
obligations and responsibilities of the Indenture Trustee created hereby
(other than the obligation of the Indenture Trustee to make payments to
Noteholders as hereinafter set forth) shall terminate, except with respect to
the duties described in Section 1408(b), as provided in the Trust Agreement.

          SECTION 1408. Final Distribution.

          (a) The Servicer shall give the Indenture Trustee at least thirty
(30) days prior written notice of the Payment Date on which the Noteholders of
any series or class may surrender their Notes for payment of the final
distribution on and cancellation of such Notes. Not later than the fifth day
of the month in which the final distribution in respect of such series or
class is payable to Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee shall provide notice to
Noteholders of such series or class specifying (i) the date upon which final
payment of such series or class will be made upon presentation and surrender
of Notes of such series or class at the office or offices therein designated,
(ii) the amount of any such final payment and (iii) that the Record Date
otherwise applicable to such payment date is not applicable, payments being
made only upon presentation and surrender of such Notes at the office or
offices therein specified (which, in the case of Bearer Notes, shall be
outside the United States). The Indenture Trustee shall give such notice to
the Note Registrar and the Paying Agent at the time such notice is given to
Noteholders.



                                      84
<PAGE>



          (b) Notwithstanding a final distribution to the Noteholders of any
series or class (or the termination of the Issuer), except as otherwise
provided in this paragraph, all funds then on deposit in any Account allocated
to such Noteholders shall continue to be held in trust for the benefit of such
Noteholders, and the Paying Agent or the Indenture Trustee shall pay such
funds to such Noteholders upon surrender of their Notes, if certificated. In
the event that all such Noteholders shall not surrender their Notes for
cancellation within six (6) months after the date specified in the notice from
the Indenture Trustee described in paragraph (a), the Indenture Trustee shall
give a second notice to the remaining such Noteholders to surrender their
Notes for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto
(which surrender and payment, in the case of Bearer Notes, shall be outside
the United States). If within one year after the second notice all such Notes
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Indenture Trustee may
take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to
contact the remaining such Noteholders concerning surrender of their Notes,
and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds in the Collection Account,
the Excess Funding Account or any Supplemental Account held for the benefit of
such Noteholders. The Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the
Issuer any monies held by them for the payment of principal or interest that
remains unclaimed for two (2) years. After payment to the Issuer, Noteholders
entitled to the money must look to the Issuer for payment as general creditors
unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.

          SECTION 1409. Termination Distributions. Upon the termination of the
Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Indenture Trustee
shall release, assign and convey to the Beneficiary or any of its designees,
without recourse, representation or warranty, all of its right, title and
interest in the Collateral, whether then existing or thereafter created, all
monies due or to become due and all amounts received or receivable with
respect thereto (including all moneys then held in any Account) and all
proceeds thereof, except for amounts held by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to
Section 1408(b). The Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver such
instruments of transfer and assignment as shall be provided to it, in each
case without recourse, as shall be reasonably requested by the Beneficiary to
vest in the Beneficiary or any of its designees all right, title and interest
which the Indenture Trustee had in the Collateral and such other property.

          SECTION 1410. Enhancement Providers as Third-Party Beneficiaries.
Each Enhancement Provider is a third-party beneficiary of this Indenture to
the extent specified in the applicable Enhancement Agreement or Indenture
Supplement.

                     DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust, Series [______],
                     [Class] [_] Notes


Ladies and Gentlemen:

         In connection with our purchase of the above Notes (the "Notes") we
confirm that:

         (1) We understand that the Notes are not being registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and are being sold
to us in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act.

         (2) Any information we desire concerning the Notes or any other
matter relevant to our decision to purchase the Notes is or has been made
available to us.

         (3) We have such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment
in the Notes, and we (and any account for which we are purchasing under
paragraph (4) below) are able to bear the economic risk of an investment in
the Notes. We (and any account for which we are purchasing under paragraph (4)
below) are an "accredited investor" (as such term is defined in Rule
501(a)(1), (2) or (3) of Regulation D under the Securities Act).

         (4) We are acquiring the Notes for our own account or for accounts as
to which we exercise sole investment discretion and not with a view to any
distribution of the Notes, subject, nevertheless, to the understanding that
the disposition of our property shall at all times be and remain within our
control;


                                      C-1

<PAGE>


         (5) We agree that the Notes must be held indefinitely by us unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from any
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities law is available;

         (6) We agree that in the event that at some future time we wish to
dispose of or exchange any of the Notes (such disposition or exchange not
being currently foreseen or contemplated), we will not transfer or exchange
any of the Notes unless:

                  (a) (i) the sale is of at least U.S.$250,000 principal
         amount of Notes to an Eligible Purchaser (as defined below), (ii) a
         letter to substantially the same effect as paragraphs (1), (2), (3),
         (4), (5) and (6) of this letter is executed promptly by the purchaser
         and (iii) all offers or solicitations in connection with the sale,
         whether directly or through any agent acting on our behalf, are
         limited only to Eligible Purchasers and are not made by means of any
         form of general solicitation or general advertising whatsoever; or

                  (b) the Notes are transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the
         Securities Act by us after we have held them for more than three
         years; or

                  (c) the Notes are sold in any other transaction that does
         not require registration under the Securities Act and, if the Issuer,
         the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Note Registrar so
         requests, we theretofore have furnished to such party an opinion of
         counsel satisfactory to such party, in form and substance
         satisfactory to such party, to such effect; or

                  (d) the Notes are transferred pursuant to an exception from
         the registration requirements of the Securities Act under Rule 144A
         under the Securities Act; and

         (7) We understand that the Notes will bear a legend to substantially
the following effect:

               "THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
               OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"). NEITHER THIS
               NOTE NOR ANY PORTION HEREOF MAY BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT IN
               COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF THE
               SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF ANY STATE
               BLUE SKY OR SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE
               EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION PROVISIONS. THE TRANSFER OF
               THIS NOTE IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE
               INDENTURE REFERRED TO HEREIN."

This legend may be removed if the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Note
Registrar have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to them, in form
and substance satisfactory to them, to the effect that the legend may be
removed.

         "Eligible Purchaser" means either an Eligible Dealer or a
corporation, partnership or other entity which we have reasonable grounds to
believe and do believe can make


                                      C-2

representations with respect to itself to substantially the same effect as the
representations set forth herein.

         "Eligible Dealer" means any corporation or other entity the principal
business of which is acting as a broker and/or dealer in securities.

         Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Amended and Restated Indenture dated as of December
16, 2004, between DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust and The Bank of New York,
as indenture trustee.


                               Very truly yours,

Amount on such date).

            (a) Budgeted Deposits. Subject to Section 3.07(b), with respect to

      notified the



                                      19
<PAGE>

      Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put Feature in
      respect of their Series 2002-A Notes; or

            (ii) the Majority Holders of the Series 2002-A Notes have notified
      the Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put Feature in
      respect of their Series 2002-A Notes and the net proceeds of the sale of
      Receivables pursuant to such exercise (as described below) plus amounts
      on deposit in the Principal Funding Account would be sufficient to pay
      all amounts due on the Series 2002-A Notes; or

            (iii) (A) the Indenture Trustee determines that the funds to be
      allocated to the Series 2002-A Notes, including (1) Series 2002-A
      Available Interest Amounts and Series 2002-A Available Principal Amounts
      and (2) amounts on deposit in the Principal Funding Account, may not be
      sufficient on an ongoing basis to make payments on the Series 2002-A
      Notes as such payments would have become due if such obligations had not
      been declared due and payable and (B) Holders of Series 2002-A Notes
      evidencing at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount
      of the Series 2002-A Notes have notified the Indenture Trustee that they
      desire to exercise the Put Feature in respect of their Series 2002-A
      Notes.

If the Put Feature is deemed to be exercised as provided in the preceding
sentence, it shall be deemed to be exercised by all Holders of the Series
2002-A Notes, whether or not they actually give notice of their desire to
exercise the Put Feature. Upon such deemed exercise of the Put Feature, the
Indenture Trustee shall cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the
related Non-Principal Receivables (or interests therein) in an amount up to
the Series 2002-A Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2002-A Notes. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture. The Holders of the Series 2002-A Notes
shall maintain their rights in their Series 2002-A Notes until such sale
proceeds have been applied in accordance with Section 706 of the Indenture and
shall present their Series 2002-A Notes to the Issuer in accordance with
Section 706 of the Indenture as part of their exercise of the Put Feature.

            (b) If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-A Notes
is greater than zero on the Legal Maturity Date (after giving effect to
deposits and distributions otherwise to be made on the Legal Maturity Date),
the Issuer will cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the related
Non-Principal Receivables on the Legal Maturity Date in an amount up to the
Series 2002-A Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2002-A Notes; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that in no
event shall the amount of Principal Receivables so sold by the Issuer exceed
the Series 2002-A Nominal Liquidation Amount.

            (c) Sales proceeds received with respect to the Series 2002-A
Notes pursuant to clause (b) above will be allocated in the following
priority:

            (i) first, to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account, an
      amount up to the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
      Series 2002-A Notes immediately before giving effect to such deposit;
      and



                                      20
<PAGE>

            (ii) second, to be deposited in the Interest Funding Account, the
      balance of such sales proceeds.

            (d) Any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Funding
Account after a sale of Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.15 and the
final payment of the Series 2002-A Notes pursuant to Section 503 of the
Indenture, will be treated as part of the Series 2002-A Available Interest
Amount.

            SECTION 3.16. Calculation Agent; Determination of LIBOR.

            (a) The Issuer hereby agrees that for so long as any Series 2002-A
Notes are Outstanding, there shall at all times be an agent appointed to
calculate LIBOR for each Interest Period (the "Calculation Agent"). The Issuer
hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee as the Calculation Agent for
purposes of determining LIBOR for each Interest Period. The Calculation Agent
may be removed by the Issuer at any time. If the Calculation Agent is unable
or unwilling to act as such or is removed by the Issuer, or if the Calculation
Agent fails to determine LIBOR for an Interest Period, the Issuer shall
promptly appoint a replacement Calculation Agent that does not control or is
not controlled by or under common control with the Issuer or its Affiliates.
The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties, and the Issuer may not remove
the Calculation Agent, without a successor having been duly appointed and
having accepted such appointment.

            (b) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
determine LIBOR for the following Interest Period to equal the offered rate
for United States dollar deposits for one month that appears on Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such date. If that rate appears on
Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR will be that rate. If on any LIBOR Determination
Date the offered rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation
Agent will request each of the Reference Banks, to provide the Calculation
Agent with its offered quotation for United States dollar deposits for one
month to prime banks in the London interbank market as of 11:00 A.M., London
time, on the date. If at least two Reference Banks provide the Calculation
Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the arithmetic
mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
all the quotations. If on that date fewer than two Reference Banks provide the
Calculation Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the
arithmetic mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
the offered per annum rates that one or more leading banks in The City of New
York selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as of 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on that date to leading European banks for United States dollar
deposits for one month. If, however, those banks are not quoting as described
above, LIBOR for that date will be LIBOR applicable to the Interest Period
immediately preceding that Interest Period.

            (c) The Series 2002-A Note Interest Rate, applicable to the then
current and the immediately preceding Interest Periods, may be obtained by
telephoning the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office at (212)
328-7623 or such other telephone number as shall be designated by the
Indenture Trustee for such purpose by prior written notice by the Indenture
Trustee to each Series 2002-A Noteholder from time to time.



                                      21
<PAGE>

            (d) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
send to the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and the Seller, by facsimile
transmission, notification of LIBOR for the following Interest Period.

            SECTION 3.17.  Excess Available Interest Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2002-A on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2002-A Available Interest Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2002-A with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2002-A Available Interest Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2002-A on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Series 2002-A Available Interest Amount
Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for all series
of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Interest Amount that is not
required to be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of
Notes shall be released to the Issuer for distribution in respect of the
Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

            SECTION 3.18.  Excess Available Principal Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2002-A on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2002-A Available Principal Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2002-A with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2002-A Available Principal Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2002-A on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Series 2002-A Available Principal
Amount Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for
all series of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Principal Amount not required to
be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of Notes shall
be applied as Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to Section 4.06 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement.



                                      22
<PAGE>

            SECTION 3.19.  Computation of Interest.

            (a) Interest on the Series 2002-A Notes shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the related
Interest Period.

            (b) Unless otherwise specified in this Indenture Supplement,
interest for any period will be calculated from and including the first day of
such period to and including the last day of such period.

            SECTION 3.20.  Variable Accumulation Period.

            The Issuer, acting directly or through the Administrator, may
elect, by written notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Beneficiary, to
delay, from time to time, the commencement of the Accumulation Period, and
extend the length of the Revolving Period, subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 3.20; provided, however, that the Accumulation Period shall
commence no later than the first day of the Monthly Period ending immediately
prior to the Series 2002-A Expected Final Payment Date. Any such election by
the Issuer shall be made not later than the first day of the last scheduled
Monthly Period of the Revolving Period (including any prior extension of the
Revolving Period pursuant to this Section 3.20). The Issuer may make such
election only if the following conditions are satisfied:

            (i) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee a
      certificate to the effect that the Issuer reasonably believes that the
      delay in the commencement of the Accumulation Period would not result in
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-A Notes not
      being paid in full on the Series 2002-A Expected Principal Payment Date;

            (ii) the Note Rating Agencies shall have advised the Issuer that
      such election to delay the commencement of the Accumulation Period would
      not cause the rating of any class of any series of Notes then
      outstanding to be lowered or withdrawn; and

            (iii) the amount to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account
      in respect of Controlled Accumulation Amount shall have been adjusted.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Indenture to the contrary, the
Administrator may, on behalf of the Issuer, (i) perform all such calculations
as are necessary to determine whether the Accumulation Period may be delayed
pursuant to this Section 3.20 and (ii) elect to delay the Accumulation Period
pursuant to this Section 3.20.

            SECTION 3.21. Payments to the Issuer. As an administrative
convenience for the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Seller all
amounts payable or to be released hereunder to the Issuer. The Issuer shall
give the Indenture Trustee written instructions as to who the Seller is and
where to make such payments.

            SECTION 3.22. Payment Instructions and Monthly Noteholders'
Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary,
the Issuer may amend the form of Payment Instruction for the Series 2002-A
Notes and the Series 2002-A Schedule to Monthly Noteholders' Statement from
time to time without the consent of the Indenture Trustee



                                      23
<PAGE>

or any Noteholder if it receives written confirmation from each Note Rating
Agency that such amendment will not cause a Ratings Effect.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                           EARLY REDEMPTION OF NOTES

            SECTION 4.01. Early Redemption Events. In addition to the events
identified as Early Redemption Events in Section 1201 of the Indenture, each
of the following events will also be an Early Redemption Event with respect to
the Series 2002-A Notes:

            (1) failure on the part of the Seller, the Servicer or DCS (if DCS
      is no longer the Servicer), as applicable, (i) to make any payment or
      deposit (including any Transfer Deposit Amount or Adjustment Payment)
      required by the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the
      Receivables Purchase Agreement on or before the date occurring two
      Business Days after the date such payment or deposit is required to be
      made therein, or (ii) to deliver a Monthly Noteholders' Statement or
      Payment Instruction within five Business Days of the day such item is
      due to be delivered under the Indenture, or (iii) duly to observe or
      perform in any material respect the covenant of the Seller set forth in
      Section 2.06(a) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or (iv) duly to
      observe or perform in any material respect any other covenants or
      agreements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, set forth
      in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Receivables Purchase
      Agreement, which failure in the case of this subclause (iv) continues
      unremedied for a period of 45 days after the date on which written
      notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
      been given to the Seller by the Indenture Trustee;

            (2) any representation or warranty made by DCS in the Receivables
      Purchase Agreement or the Seller in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or
      any information contained in a computer file or microfiche or written
      list required to be delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section 2.01,
      2.05, 2.07 or 2.08 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, (i) shall prove
      to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or when
      delivered, and shall continue to be incorrect in any material respect
      for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of such
      failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
      Seller by the Indenture Trustee and (ii) as a result of such
      incorrectness the interests of the Series 2002-A Noteholders are
      materially and adversely affected; provided, however, that an Early
      Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-A Notes shall not be
      deemed to have occurred under this clause (2) if the Seller has
      repurchased the related Receivable or all such Receivables, if
      applicable, during such period in accordance with the provisions of the
      Sale and Servicing Agreement;

            (3) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
      Seller, DCS or DaimlerChrysler;



                                      24
<PAGE>

            (4) a failure by the Seller to convey Receivables in Additional
      Accounts to the Issuer within five Business Days after the day on which
      it is required to convey such Receivables pursuant to the Sale and
      Servicing Agreement;

            (5) on any Payment Date, the Primary Overcollateralization Amount
      for such Payment Date is reduced to an amount less than the Required
      Primary Overcollateralization Amount on that Payment Date after giving
      effect to the distributions to be made on such Payment Date; provided
      that, for the purpose of determining whether an Early Redemption Event
      has occurred pursuant to this clause (5), any reduction of the Primary
      Overcollateralization Amount resulting from reallocations of the Series
      2002-A Available Principal Amounts to pay interest on the Series 2002-A
      Notes in the event LIBOR is equal to or greater than the prime rate upon
      which interest on the Receivables is calculated on the applicable LIBOR
      Determination Date will be considered an Early Redemption Event only if
      LIBOR remains equal to or greater than such prime rate for the next 30
      consecutive days following such LIBOR Determination Date;

            (6) any Service Default occurs;

            (7) on any Determination Date, as of the last day of the preceding
      Collection Period, the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
      relating to Used Vehicles exceeds 20% of the Pool Balance on that last
      day;

            (8) on any Determination Date, the average of the Monthly Payment
      Rates for the three preceding Collection Periods is less than 20%;

            (9) the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-A
      Notes is not repaid by the Series 2002-A Expected Principal Payment
      Date;

            (10) the Seller or the Issuer becomes an investment company within
      the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

            (11) the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the
      Series 2002-A Notes.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, in the case of
any event described in clause (1), (2) or (6) above, an Early Redemption Event
with respect to Series 2002-A will be deemed to have occurred only if, after
the applicable grace period described in such clause, if any, either the
Indenture Trustee or Series 2002-A Noteholders holding Series 2002-A Notes
evidencing more than 50% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2002-A Notes by written notice to the Seller, the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, if given by Series 2002-A Noteholders, declare that an
Early Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-A Notes has occurred as
of the date of that notice. In the case of any Early Redemption Event
described in clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (11) above, an Early
Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-A Notes shall be deemed to
have occurred without any notice or other action on the part of the Indenture
Trustee or the Series 2002-A Noteholders immediately upon the occurrence of
such event.



                                      25
<PAGE>

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if (x) an
Early Redemption Period results from the failure by DCWR to convey Receivables
in Additional Accounts to the Issuer, as described in clause (4) above during
the Revolving Period, (y) no other Early Redemption Event that has not been
cured or waived in accordance with the Indenture has occurred and (z) each
Note Rating Agency has confirmed that recommencing the Revolving Period will
not cause a Ratings Effect, then the Early Redemption Period resulting from
such failure will terminate and the Revolving Period will recommence as of the
end of the first Collection Period during which the Seller would no longer be
required to convey Receivables in Additional Accounts to the Issuer; provided
that the Revolving Period will not recommence if the scheduled termination
date of the Revolving Period has occurred.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if an Early
Redemption Event (other than an Early Redemption Event specified in clause (3)
or (10) above) has occurred and the scheduled termination of the Revolving
Period has not occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall request from Standard &
Poor's a confirmation that such Early Redemption Event will not cause a
Ratings Effect. If the Indenture Trustee receives such confirmation and the
Majority Holders of Series 2002-A Notes consent to the recommencement of the
Revolving Period, the related Early Redemption Period shall terminate and the
Revolving Period shall recommence.

                                   ARTICLE V

                           ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS

            SECTION 5.01.  Accounts.

            (a) Accounts; Deposits to and Distributions from Accounts. On or
before the Issuance Date, the Indenture Trustee will cause to be established
and maintained two Qualified Accounts denominated as follows: the "Interest
Funding Account" and the "Principal Funding Account" (collectively, the
"Series 2002-A Accounts") in the name of the Indenture Trustee, bearing a
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for
the benefit of the Series 2002-A Noteholders. The Series 2002-A Accounts
constitute Supplemental Accounts and shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2002-A
Noteholders. If, at any time, the institution holding any Series 2002-A
Account ceases to be a Qualified Institution, the Issuer will within ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
as to which each Note Rating Agency may consent) establish a new applicable
Series 2002-A Account, that is a Qualified Account and shall transfer any cash
and/or investments to such new Series 2002-A Account. From the date such new
Series 2002-A Account is established, it will be a Series 2002-A Account,
bearing the name of the Series 2002-A Account it has replaced.

            (b) All payments to be made from time to time by the Indenture
Trustee to Series 2002-A Noteholders out of funds in the Series 2002-A
Accounts pursuant to this Indenture Supplement will be made by the Indenture
Trustee to the Paying Agent not later than 12:00 noon on the applicable
Interest Payment Date or Principal Payment Date but only to the extent of
funds in the applicable Series 2002-A Account or as otherwise provided in
Article III.

                               [REVERSE OF NOTE]

            This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the
Issuer, designated as its Floating Rate Auto Dealer Loan Asset Backed Notes,
Series 2002-A (the "Notes" or "Series 2002-A Notes"), all issued under an
Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended,
restated and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), as supplemented
by an Amended and Restated Series 2002-A Indenture Supplement, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time,
the "Indenture Supplement"), each between the Issuer and The Bank of New York,
as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee," which term includes any
successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Notes are subject to all terms of
the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement. All terms used in this Note that
are defined in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement, each as supplemented
or amended, shall have the meanings assigned to them in or pursuant to the
Indenture or the Indenture Supplement.

            The Notes are and will be equally and ratably secured by the
collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.

            Principal of the Notes will be payable on the Expected Principal
Payment Date in an amount described on the face hereof. Upon the occurrence of
certain events specified in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement,
payments of principal of the Notes may be made prior to or after the Expected
Principal Payment Date.

            As described above, the entire unpaid principal amount of this
Note shall be due and payable on the Legal Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes may be due and
payable following an Event of Default in the manner provided in Section 702 of
the Indenture; provided, however, that such acceleration of the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes may be rescinded by the holders of not less than
a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes. All
principal payments on the Notes shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders
entitled thereto.

            On any day occurring on or after the date on which the aggregate
Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-A Notes is reduced to less than
10% of the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-A Notes, the
Servicer has the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Issuer to redeem
the Series 2002-A Notes in whole but not in part, pursuant to Section 1202 of
the Indenture equal the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series
2002-A Notes, plus interest accrued and unpaid to but excluding the date of
redemption.

            Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the
Beneficiary may, from time to time, direct the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the
Issuer, to issue one or more series or classes of notes.

            On each Payment Date, the Paying Agent shall distribute to each
Series 2002-A Noteholder of record on the related Record Date (except for the
final distribution with respect to this Note) such Series 2002-A Noteholder's
pro rata share of the amounts held by the Paying



                                     A-4
<PAGE>

Agent that are allocated and available on such Payment Date to pay interest
and principal on the Series 2002-A Notes. Final payments of this Note will be
made only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the office or
offices therein specified.

            Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Payment
Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in
full payment of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to the Person whose
name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor
Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date,
except that with respect to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of
the nominee of the clearing agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.),
payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account designated by such nominee. Such checks shall be mailed to the Person
entitled thereto at the address of such Person as it appears on the Note
Register as of the applicable Record Date without requiring that this Note be
submitted for notation of payment. Any reduction in the principal amount of
this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made
on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and
of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon. If funds are expected
to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then
remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a Payment Date, then the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the
Person who was the Registered Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding
such Payment Date by notice mailed within five days of such Payment Date and
the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee's principal Corporate Trust
Office or at the office of the Indenture Trustee's agent appointed for such
purposes located in the City of New York.

            As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note
Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company located, or having a correspondent located,
in the City of New York or the city in which the Corporate Trust Office is
located, or a member firm of a national securities exchange, and such other
documents as the Indenture Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new
Notes of authorized denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge
will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but
the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer or exchange.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and agrees
that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the
obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the
Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in
connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the
Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner,



                                     A-5
<PAGE>

beneficiary, agent, officer, director or employee of the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any
successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed and
except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to
the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock,
unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to
such entity.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
that by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that it will not at any time
institute against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or the Issuer, or
join in any institution against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or
the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States Federal
or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating
to the Notes, the Indenture or any Derivative Agreement.

            Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this
Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note (as of the day
of determination or as of such other date as may be specified in the
Indenture) is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the
Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Holders of Notes
representing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of all Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of Notes representing specified percentages
of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or
any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The
Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms
and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the consent of Holders of
the Notes issued thereunder.

            The term "Issuer" as used in this Note includes any successor to
the Issuer under the Indenture.

            The Issuer is permitted by the Indenture, under certain
circumstances, to merge or consolidate, subject to the rights of the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of Notes under the Indenture.

            The Notes are issuable only in registered form in denominations as
provided in the Indenture, subject to certain limitations therein set forth.

            THIS NOTE AND THE INDENTURE AND THE INDENTURE SUPPLEMENT WILL BE

YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION
5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW) AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS
AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this
Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency herein
prescribed.

being understood that the Owner Trustee has no such obligations in its
individual capacity). The Holder of this Note by the acceptance hereof agrees

Supplement in the case of an Event of Default under the Indenture, the Holder

of such Investor Charge-Off that is allocated to the Series 2002-B Notes
pursuant to this clause (b); provided, however, that no such allocation will
reduce the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes below zero.

            SECTION 3.04. Allocations of Reimbursements of Nominal Liquidation
Amount Deficit and Overcollateralization Amount Deficit. If, as of any Payment
Date, there is any Series 2002-B Available Interest Amount available pursuant
to Section 3.01(e) to reimburse any Nominal Liquidation Amount Deficit or
Overcollateralization Amount Deficit as of such Payment Date, such funds will
be allocated as follows:

            (a) first, to the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B
Notes, but in no event will the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series
2002-B Notes be increased above the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes; and

            (b) second, to the Overcollateralization Amount, but in no event
will the Overcollateralization Amount be increased above the
Overcollateralization Amount calculated as if there had been no reduction of
the Overcollateralization Amount pursuant to Section 3.03 or 3.06.

            SECTION 3.05. Application of Series 2002-B Available Principal
Amount. On each Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee will apply the Series
2002-B Available Principal Amount as follows:

            (a) first, if, after giving effect to deposits to be made with
respect to such Payment Date pursuant to Section 3.01(b), the Series 2002-B
Notes have not received the full amount targeted to be deposited pursuant to
Section 3.01(b) with respect to that Payment Date, then the Series 2002-B
Available Principal Amount will be allocated to the Interest Funding Account
in an amount equal to the lesser of the following amounts:

                  (i) the amount of the deficiency in such targeted amount to
      be deposited into the Interest Funding Account; and

                  (ii) the Series 2002-B Nominal Liquidation Amount
      (determined after giving effect to the application of the Investor
      Charge-Off pursuant to Section 3.03);



                                      14

            (b) second, if Series 2002-B is in its Accumulation Period or an
Early Redemption Period, (i) any remaining Series 2002-B Available Principal
Amount (after giving effect to clause (a)) will be applied to make the
targeted deposit to the Principal Funding Account pursuant to Section 3.07 and
(ii) any remaining Series 2002-B Available Principal Amount (after giving
effect to clause (i)) will be treated as Shared Excess Available Principal
Amount for application in accordance with Section 3.18;

            (c) third, if Series 2002-B is not in its Accumulation Period or
an Early Redemption Period, any remaining Series 2002-B Available Principal
Amount (after giving effect to clauses (a) and (b) above) will be treated as
Shared Excess Available Principal Amount for application in accordance with
Section 3.18; and

            (d) fourth, if the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2002-B has been reduced to zero on or before such Payment Date, the
remaining Series 2002-B Available Principal Amount (after giving effect to
clauses (a), (b) and (c)) shall be released to the Issuer for distribution in
respect of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

            SECTION 3.06. Computation of Reductions to the Nominal Liquidation
Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes and the Overcollateralization Amount from
Reallocations of Series 2002-B Available Principal Amounts.

            (a) Each reallocation of a portion of the Series 2002-B Available
Principal Amount that is deposited to the Interest Funding Account pursuant to
Section 3.05(a) will reduce the Overcollateralization Amount; provided,
however, that such reduction shall not exceed the Overcollateralization Amount
(after giving effect to any reductions pursuant to Section 3.03 for Investor
Charge-Offs).

            (b) Each reallocation of a portion of the Series 2002-B Available
Principal Amount that is deposited to the Interest Funding Account pursuant to
Section 3.05(a) in excess of the amounts applied pursuant to clause (a) above
that reduce the Overcollateralization Amount to zero will reduce the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes; provided, however, that the
amount of such reduction shall not exceed the Nominal Liquidation Amount of
the Series 2002-B Notes (after giving effect to any reductions pursuant to
Section 3.03 for Investor Charge-Offs).

            SECTION 3.07. Targeted Deposits of Series 2002-B Available
Principal Amounts to the Principal Funding Account. The Series 2002-B
Available Principal Amount that is targeted to be deposited into the Principal
Funding Account with respect to any Payment Date will be (i) the amount
determined pursuant to clause (a) or (b) below for such Payment Date, as
applicable, or if more than one such clause is applicable, the higher amount
determined pursuant to either of such clauses, plus (ii) any targeted deposit
pursuant to clause (i) for any prior Payment Date to the extent not previously
deposited, but in no case more than the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the
Series 2002-B Notes (computed immediately before giving effect to such deposit
but after giving effect to any reductions thereof due to any Investor
Charge-Offs and any reallocations of the Series 2002-B Available Principal
Amount on such date).

            (a) Budgeted Deposits. Subject to Section 3.07(b), with respect to
each Principal Payment Date, beginning with the Accumulation Commencement
Date, the targeted deposit to be made into the Principal Funding Account will
be the Controlled Deposit Amount for the related Payment Date.

            (b) Event of Default, Early Redemption Event, Other Optional or
Mandatory Redemption. If the Series 2002-B Notes have been accelerated during
a Monthly Period after the occurrence of an Event of Default, or if an Early
Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-B Notes occurs during a
Monthly Period, or with respect to the Monthly Period immediately preceding
any other date fixed for any other optional or mandatory redemption of the
Series 2002-B Notes, the targeted deposit for the Series 2002-B Notes with
respect to the Payment Date following such Monthly Period and each following
Payment Date is equal to the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B
Notes as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding Monthly
Period (taking into effect any reallocations on the following Payment Date).

            SECTION 3.08. Amounts to be Treated as Series 2002-B Available
Principal Amounts; Other Deposits to Principal Funding Account. The following
deposits and payments will be made on the following dates:

Miscellaneous Payments, any portion of the Series 2002-B Available Interest
Amount that is allocated pursuant to Section 3.01(d) or 3.01(e) shall be
treated as part of the Series 2002-B Available Principal Amount for
application in accordance with Section 3.05.

will be paid to the Issuer.

            If the aggregate amount available for withdrawal from the Interest
Funding Account is less than all withdrawals required to be made from the
Interest Funding Account, then the aggregate amount on deposit will be
withdrawn and, if payable to more than one Person, applied pro rata based on
the respective amounts of the withdrawals required to be made.

            SECTION 3.10. Withdrawals from Principal Funding Account.
Withdrawals made pursuant to this Section 3.10 with respect to the Series
2002-B Notes will be made from the Principal Funding Account only after all

            (a) Withdrawals for the Series 2002-B Notes. On each Principal
Payment Date, any amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account shall be
paid to the Paying Agent.

            Notes pursuant to Section 3.04(a) since the prior date of
            determination; minus

                                      18
<PAGE>

            calculated after giving effect to allocations, deposits and
            payments to be made on such Payment Date; provided, however, that
            if an Early Redemption Period has commenced and the Revolving
            Period has not recommenced, the amount referred to in clause (ii)
            shall be the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes
            at the commencement of that Early Redemption Period; plus

                  (B) the amount of the reimbursement of the
            Overcollateralization Amount Deficit pursuant to Section 3.01(e)
            that is allocated to the Overcollateralization Amount pursuant to
            Section 3.04(b) since the prior date of determination; minus

                  (C) the share of all reallocations of the Series 2002-A

            SECTION 3.15.  Exercise of Put Feature; Sale of Receivables for
Accelerated Notes.

            (a) If (i) an Early Redemption Event specified in Section 4.01(3)
of this Indenture Supplement occurs or (ii) the Series 2002-B Notes have been
accelerated pursuant to Section 702 of the Indenture following an Event of
Default, each Holder of a Series 2002-B Note may notify the Indenture Trustee
that it desires to exercise the Put Feature in respect of its Series 2002-B
Notes. The Put Feature shall be deemed to be exercised only if at least one of
the following conditions is met:

            (i) the Holders of Series 2002-B Notes evidencing at least 90% of
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes have
      notified the Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put
      Feature in respect of their Series 2002-B Notes; or

            (ii) the Majority Holders of the Series 2002-B Notes have notified
      the Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put Feature in
      respect of their Series 2002-B Notes and the net proceeds of the sale of
      Receivables pursuant to such exercise (as described below) plus amounts
      on deposit in the Principal Funding Account would be sufficient to pay
      all amounts due on the Series 2002-B Notes; or

            (iii) (A) the Indenture Trustee determines that the funds to be
      allocated to the Series 2002-B Notes, including (1) Series 2002-B
      Available Interest Amounts and Series 2002-B Available Principal Amounts
      and (2) amounts on deposit in the Principal Funding Account, may not be
      sufficient on an ongoing basis to make payments on the Series 2002-B
      Notes as such payments would have become due if such obligations had not
      been declared due and payable and (B) Holders of Series 2002-B Notes
      evidencing at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount
      of the Series 2002-B Notes have notified the Indenture Trustee that they
      desire to exercise the Put Feature in respect of their Series 2002-B
      Notes.

If the Put Feature is deemed to be exercised as provided in the preceding
sentence, it shall be deemed to be exercised by all Holders of the Series
2002-B Notes, whether or not they actually give notice of their desire to
exercise the Put Feature. Upon such deemed exercise of the Put Feature, the
Indenture Trustee shall cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the
related Non-Principal Receivables (or interests therein) in an amount up to
the Series 2002-B Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2002-B Notes. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture. The Holders of the Series 2002-B Notes
shall maintain their rights in their Series 2002-B Notes until such sale




                                      20
<PAGE>

proceeds have been applied in accordance with Section 706 of the Indenture and
shall present their Series 2002-B Notes to the Issuer in accordance with
Section 706 of the Indenture as part of their exercise of the Put Feature.

            (b) If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes
is greater than zero on the Legal Maturity Date (after giving effect to
deposits and distributions otherwise to be made on the Legal Maturity Date),
the Issuer will cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the related
Non-Principal Receivables on the Legal Maturity Date in an amount up to the
Series 2002-B Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2002-B Notes; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that in no
event shall the amount of Principal Receivables so sold by the Issuer exceed
the Series 2002-B Nominal Liquidation Amount.

            (c) Sales proceeds received with respect to the Series 2002-B
Notes pursuant to clause (b) above will be allocated in the following
priority:

            (i) first, to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account, an
      amount up to the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
      Series 2002-B Notes immediately before giving effect to such deposit;
      and

            (ii) second, to be deposited in the Interest Funding Account, the
      balance of such sales proceeds.

            (d) Any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Funding
Account after a sale of Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.15 and the
final payment of the Series 2002-B Notes pursuant to Section 503 of the
Indenture, will be treated as part of the Series 2002-B Available Interest
Amount.

            SECTION 3.16. Calculation Agent; Determination of LIBOR.

            (a) The Issuer hereby agrees that for so long as any Series 2002-B
Notes are Outstanding, there shall at all times be an agent appointed to
calculate LIBOR for each Interest Period (the "Calculation Agent"). The Issuer
hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee as the Calculation Agent for
purposes of determining LIBOR for each Interest Period. The Calculation Agent
may be removed by the Issuer at any time. If the Calculation Agent is unable
or unwilling to act as such or is removed by the Issuer, or if the Calculation
Agent fails to determine LIBOR for an Interest Period, the Issuer shall
promptly appoint a replacement Calculation Agent that does not control or is
not controlled by or under common control with the Issuer or its Affiliates.
The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties, and the Issuer may not remove
the Calculation Agent, without a successor having been duly appointed and
having accepted such appointment.

            (b) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
determine LIBOR for the following Interest Period to equal the offered rate
for United States dollar deposits for one month that appears on Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such date. If that rate appears on
Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR will be that rate. If on any LIBOR Determination
Date the offered rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation
Agent will request each of the Reference Banks, to provide the Calculation
Agent



                                      21
<PAGE>

with its offered quotation for United States dollar deposits for one
month to prime banks in the London interbank market as of 11:00 A.M., London
time, on the date. If at least two Reference Banks provide the Calculation
Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the arithmetic
mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
all the quotations. If on that date fewer than two Reference Banks provide the
Calculation Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the
arithmetic mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
the offered per annum rates that one or more leading banks in The City of New
York selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as of 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on that date to leading European banks for United States dollar
deposits for one month. If, however, those banks are not quoting as described
above, LIBOR for that date will be LIBOR applicable to the Interest Period
immediately preceding that Interest Period.

            (c) The Series 2002-B Note Interest Rate, applicable to the then
current and the immediately preceding Interest Periods, may be obtained by
telephoning the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office at (212)
328-7623 or such other telephone number as shall be designated by the
Indenture Trustee for such purpose by prior written notice by the Indenture
Trustee to each Series 2002-B Noteholder from time to time.

            (d) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall

            SECTION 3.17.  Excess Available Interest Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2002-B on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2002-B Available Interest Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2002-B with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2002-B Available Interest Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2002-B on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Series 2002-B Available Interest Amount
Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for all series
of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Interest Amount that is not
required to be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of

Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

            SECTION 3.18.  Excess Available Principal Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2002-B on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2002-B Available Principal Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2002-B with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2002-B Available Principal Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2002-B on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Series 2002-B Available Principal
Amount Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for
all series of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Principal Amount not required to
be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of Notes shall
be applied as Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to Section 4.06 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

            SECTION 3.19.  Computation of Interest.

            (a) Interest on the Series 2002-B Notes shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the related

            (b) Unless otherwise specified in this Indenture Supplement,
interest for any period will be calculated from and including the first day of
such period to and including the last day of such period.

            SECTION 3.20.  Variable Accumulation Period.

            The Issuer, acting directly or through the Administrator, may
elect, by written notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Beneficiary, to
delay, from time to time, the commencement of the Accumulation Period, and
extend the length of the Revolving Period, subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 3.20; provided, however, that the Accumulation Period shall
commence no later than the first day of the Monthly Period ending immediately
prior to the Series 2002-B Expected Final Payment Date. Any such election by
the Issuer shall be made not later than the first day of the last scheduled
Monthly Period of the Revolving Period (including any prior extension of the
Revolving Period pursuant to this Section 3.20). The Issuer may make such
election only if the following conditions are satisfied:

            (i) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee a
      certificate to the effect that the Issuer reasonably believes that the
      delay in the commencement of the Accumulation Period would not result in
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes not
      being paid in full on the Series 2002-B Expected Principal Payment Date;



                                      23
<PAGE>

            (ii) the Note Rating Agencies shall have advised the Issuer that
      such election to delay the commencement of the Accumulation Period would
      not cause the rating of any class of any series of Notes then
      outstanding to be lowered or withdrawn; and

            (iii) the amount to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account
      in respect of Controlled Accumulation Amount shall have been adjusted.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Indenture to the contrary, the
Administrator may, on behalf of the Issuer, (i) perform all such calculations
as are necessary to determine whether the Accumulation Period may be delayed
pursuant to this Section 3.20 and (ii) elect to delay the Accumulation Period
pursuant to this Section 3.20.

            SECTION 3.21. Payments to the Issuer. As an administrative
convenience for the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Seller all
amounts payable or to be released hereunder to the Issuer. The Issuer shall
give the Indenture Trustee written instructions as to who the Seller is and
where to make such payments.

            SECTION 3.22. Payment Instructions and Monthly Noteholders'
Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary,
the Issuer may amend the form of Payment Instruction for the Series 2002-B
Notes and the Series 2002-B Schedule to Monthly Noteholders' Statement from
time to time without the consent of the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder if
it receives written confirmation from each Note Rating Agency that such
amendment will not cause a Ratings Effect.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                           EARLY REDEMPTION OF NOTES

            SECTION 4.01. Early Redemption Events. In addition to the events
identified as Early Redemption Events in Section 1201 of the Indenture, each
of the following events will also be an Early Redemption Event with respect to
the Series 2002-B Notes:

            (1) failure on the part of the Seller, the Servicer or DCS (if DCS
      is no longer the Servicer), as applicable, (i) to make any payment or
      deposit (including any Transfer Deposit Amount or Adjustment Payment)
      required by the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the
      Receivables Purchase Agreement on or before the date occurring two
      Business Days after the date such payment or deposit is required to be
      made therein, or (ii) to deliver a Monthly Noteholders' Statement or
      Payment Instruction within five Business Days of the day such item is
      due to be delivered under the Indenture, or (iii) duly to observe or
      perform in any material respect the covenant of the Seller set forth in
      Section 2.06(a) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or (iv) duly to
      observe or perform in any material respect any other covenants or
      agreements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, set forth
      in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Receivables Purchase
      Agreement, which failure in the case of this subclause (iv) continues
      unremedied for a period of 45 days after the date on which written
      notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
      been given to the Seller by the Indenture Trustee;



                                      24
<PAGE>

            (2) any representation or warranty made by DCS in the Receivables
      Purchase Agreement or the Seller in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or
      any information contained in a computer file or microfiche or written
      list required to be delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section 2.01,
      2.05, 2.07 or 2.08 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, (i) shall prove
      to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or when
      delivered, and shall continue to be incorrect in any material respect
      for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of such
      failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
      Seller by the Indenture Trustee and (ii) as a result of such
      incorrectness the interests of the Series 2002-B Noteholders are
      materially and adversely affected; provided, however, that an Early
      Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-B Notes shall not be
      deemed to have occurred under this clause (2) if the Seller has
      repurchased the related Receivable or all such Receivables, if
      applicable, during such period in accordance with the provisions of the
      Sale and Servicing Agreement;

            (3) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
      Seller, DCS or DaimlerChrysler;

            (4) a failure by the Seller to convey Receivables in Additional
      Accounts to the Issuer within five Business Days after the day on which
      it is required to convey such Receivables pursuant to the Sale and
      Servicing Agreement;

            (5) on any Payment Date, the Primary Overcollateralization Amount
      for such Payment Date is reduced to an amount less than the Required
      Primary Overcollateralization Amount on that Payment Date after giving
      effect to the distributions to be made on such Payment Date; provided
      that, for the purpose of determining whether an Early Redemption Event
      has occurred pursuant to this clause (5), any reduction of the Primary
      Overcollateralization Amount resulting from reallocations of the Series
      2002-B Available Principal Amounts to pay interest on the Series 2002-B
      Notes in the event LIBOR is equal to or greater than the prime rate upon
      which interest on the Receivables is calculated on the applicable LIBOR
      Determination Date will be considered an Early Redemption Event only if
      LIBOR remains equal to or greater than such prime rate for the next 30
      consecutive days following such LIBOR Determination Date;

            (6) any Service Default occurs;

            (7) on any Determination Date, as of the last day of the preceding
      Collection Period, the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
      relating to Used Vehicles exceeds 20% of the Pool Balance on that last
      day;

            (8) on any Determination Date, the average of the Monthly Payment
      Rates for the three preceding Collection Periods is less than 20%;

            (9) the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-B
      Notes is not repaid by the Series 2002-B Expected Principal Payment
      Date;



                                      25
<PAGE>

            (10) the Seller or the Issuer becomes an investment company within
      the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

            (11) the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the
      Series 2002-B Notes.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, in the case of
any event described in clause (1), (2) or (6) above, an Early Redemption Event
with respect to Series 2002-B will be deemed to have occurred only if, after
the applicable grace period described in such clause, if any, either the
Indenture Trustee or Series 2002-B Noteholders holding Series 2002-B Notes
evidencing more than 50% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2002-B Notes by written notice to the Seller, the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, if given by Series 2002-B Noteholders, declare that an
Early Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-B Notes has occurred as
of the date of that notice. In the case of any Early Redemption Event
described in clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (11) above, an Early
Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2002-B Notes shall be deemed to
have occurred without any notice or other action on the part of the Indenture
Trustee or the Series 2002-B Noteholders immediately upon the occurrence of
such event.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if (x) an
Early Redemption Period results from the failure by DCWR to convey Receivables
in Additional Accounts to the Issuer, as described in clause (4) above during
the Revolving Period, (y) no other Early Redemption Event that has not been
cured or waived in accordance with the Indenture has occurred and (z) each
Note Rating Agency has confirmed that recommencing the Revolving Period will
not cause a Ratings Effect, then the Early Redemption Period resulting from
such failure will terminate and the Revolving Period will recommence as of the
end of the first Collection Period during which the Seller would no longer be
required to convey Receivables in Additional Accounts to the Issuer; provided
that the Revolving Period will not recommence if the scheduled termination
date of the Revolving Period has occurred.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if an Early
Redemption Event (other than an Early Redemption Event specified in clause (3)
or (10) above) has occurred and the scheduled termination of the Revolving
Period has not occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall request from Standard &
Poor's a confirmation that such Early Redemption Event will not cause a
Ratings Effect. If the Indenture Trustee receives such confirmation and the
Majority Holders of Series 2002-B Notes consent to the recommencement of the
Revolving Period, the related Early Redemption Period shall terminate and the
Revolving Period shall recommence.

Account" (collectively, the "Series 2002-B Accounts") in the name of the
Indenture Trustee, bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-B Noteholders.
The Series 2002-B Accounts constitute Supplemental Accounts and shall be under
the sole dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
Series 2002-B Noteholders. If, at any time, the institution holding any Series
2002-B Account ceases to be a Qualified Institution, the Issuer will within
ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30)
calendar days, as to which each Note Rating Agency may consent) establish a
new applicable Series 2002-B Account, that is a Qualified Account and shall
transfer any cash and/or investments to such new Series 2002-B Account. From
the date such new Series 2002-B Account is established, it will be a Series
2002-B Account, bearing the name of the Series 2002-B Account it has replaced.

            (b) All payments to be made from time to time by the Indenture
Trustee to Series 2002-B Noteholders out of funds in the Series 2002-B
Accounts pursuant to this Indenture Supplement will be made by the Indenture
Trustee to the Paying Agent not later than 12:00 noon on the applicable
Interest Payment Date or Principal Payment Date but only to the extent of
funds in the applicable Series 2002-B Account or as otherwise provided in
Article III.

by an Amended and Restated Series 2002-B Indenture Supplement, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time,
the "Indenture Supplement"), each between the Issuer and The Bank of New York,
as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee," which term includes any
successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Notes are subject to all terms of
the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement. All terms used in this Note that
are defined in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement, each as supplemented
or amended, shall have the meanings assigned to them in or pursuant to the
Indenture or the Indenture Supplement.

            The Notes are and will be equally and ratably secured by the
collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.

            Principal of the Notes will be payable on the Expected Principal
Payment Date in an amount described on the face hereof. Upon the occurrence of
certain events specified in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement,
payments of principal of the Notes may be made prior to or after the Expected
Principal Payment Date.

            As described above, the entire unpaid principal amount of this
Note shall be due and payable on the Legal Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes may be due and
payable following an Event of Default in the manner provided in Section 702 of
the Indenture; provided, however, that such acceleration of the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes may be rescinded by the holders of not less than
a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes. All
principal payments on the Notes shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders
entitled thereto.

            On any day occurring on or after the date on which the aggregate
Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes is reduced to less than
10% of the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2002-B Notes, the
Servicer has the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Issuer to redeem
the Series 2002-B Notes in whole but not in part, pursuant to Section 1202 of
the Indenture equal the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series
2002-B Notes, plus interest accrued and unpaid to but excluding the date of
redemption.

            Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the
Beneficiary may, from time to time, direct the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the
Issuer, to issue one or more series or classes of notes.

            On each Payment Date, the Paying Agent shall distribute to each
Series 2002-B Noteholder of record on the related Record Date (except for the
final distribution with respect to this Note) such Series 2002-B Noteholder's
pro rata share of the amounts held by the Paying



                                     A-4

Agent that are allocated and available on such Payment Date to pay interest
and principal on the Series 2002-B Notes. Final payments of this Note will be
made only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the office or
offices therein specified.

            Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Payment
Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in
full payment of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to the Person whose
name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor
Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date,
except that with respect to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of
the nominee of the clearing agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.),
payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account designated by such nominee. Such checks shall be mailed to the Person
entitled thereto at the address of such Person as it appears on the Note
Register as of the applicable Record Date without requiring that this Note be
submitted for notation of payment. Any reduction in the principal amount of
this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made
on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and
of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon. If funds are expected
to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then
remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a Payment Date, then the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the
Person who was the Registered Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding
such Payment Date by notice mailed within five days of such Payment Date and
the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee's principal Corporate Trust
Office or at the office of the Indenture Trustee's agent appointed for such
purposes located in the City of New York.

            As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note
Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company located, or having a correspondent located,
in the City of New York or the city in which the Corporate Trust Office is
located, or a member firm of a national securities exchange, and such other
documents as the Indenture Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new
Notes of authorized denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge
will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but
the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer or exchange.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and agrees
that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the
obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the
Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in
connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the
Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner,



                                     A-5
<PAGE>

beneficiary, agent, officer, director or employee of the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any
successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed and
except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to
the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock,
unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to
such entity.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
that by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that it will not at any time
institute against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or the Issuer, or
join in any institution against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or
the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States Federal
or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating
to the Notes, the Indenture or any Derivative Agreement.

            Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this
Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note (as of the day
of determination or as of such other date as may be specified in the
Indenture) is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the
Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Holders of Notes
representing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of all Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of Notes representing specified percentages
of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or
any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The
Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms
and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the consent of Holders of
the Notes issued thereunder.

            The term "Issuer" as used in this Note includes any successor to
the Issuer under the Indenture.

            The Issuer is permitted by the Indenture, under certain
circumstances, to merge or consolidate, subject to the rights of the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of Notes under the Indenture.

            THIS NOTE AND THE INDENTURE AND THE INDENTURE SUPPLEMENT WILL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION
5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW) AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS
AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

            No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this
Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency herein
prescribed.

            No recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to
the obligations of the Issuer on the Notes or under the Indenture or any
certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith,
against (i) the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a
beneficial interest in the Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary,
agent, officer, director, employee or agent of the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or the
Owner Trustee or of any successor or assign of the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed (it
being understood that the Owner Trustee has no such obligations in its
individual capacity). The Holder of this Note by the acceptance hereof agrees
that, except as expressly provided in the Indenture and the Indenture
Supplement in the case of an Event of Default under the Indenture, the Holder
shall have no claim against any of the foregoing for any deficiency, loss or
claim therefrom; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be
taken to prevent recourse to, and enforcement against, the assets of the
Issuer for any and all liabilities, obligations and undertakings contained in
the Indenture or in this Note.

2003-A Notes, any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Funding Account
will be paid to the Issuer.

            If the aggregate amount available for withdrawal from the Interest
Funding Account is less than all withdrawals required to be made from the
Interest Funding Account, then the aggregate amount on deposit will be
withdrawn and, if payable to more than one Person, applied pro rata based on
the respective amounts of the withdrawals required to be made.

the Principal Funding Account only after all allocations and reallocations
have been made pursuant to Sections 3.05, 3.07 and 3.08. In no event will the

Principal Funding Account.

            (a) Withdrawals for the Series 2003-A Notes. On each Principal
Payment Date, any amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account shall be

            (b) Payment to the Issuer. Upon payment in full of the Series
2003-A Notes, any remaining amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account
will be paid to the Issuer.

            If the aggregate amount available for withdrawal from the
Principal Funding Account is less than all withdrawals required to be made
from that Principal Funding Account, then the amounts on deposit will be
withdrawn and, if payable to more than one Person, applied pro rata based on
the amounts of the respective withdrawals required to be made.

the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes will be zero.

            (b) On or prior to each Payment Date the Issuer shall calculate
the Overcollateralization Amount, which shall be the following amount:

            (i) as of the Issuance Date, $148,351,648; and

            giving effect to allocations, deposits and payments to be made on
            such Payment Date; provided, however, that if an Early Redemption
            Period has commenced and the Revolving Period has not recommenced,
            the amount referred to in clause (ii) shall be the Nominal
            Liquidation Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes at the commencement
            of that Early Redemption Period; plus

                  (B) the amount of the reimbursement of the

            that is allocated to the Overcollateralization Amount pursuant to
            Section 3.04(b) since the prior date of determination; minus

                  (C) the share of all reallocations of the Series 2002-A

            Section 3.15.  Exercise of Put Feature; Sale of Receivables for
Accelerated Notes.

            (a) If (i) an Early Redemption Event specified in Section 4.01(3)
of this Indenture Supplement occurs or (ii) the Series 2003-A Notes have been
accelerated pursuant to Section 702 of the Indenture following an Event of
Default, each Holder of a Series 2003-A Note may notify the Indenture Trustee
that it desires to exercise the Put Feature in respect of its Series 2003-A
Notes. The Put Feature shall be deemed to be exercised only if at least one of
the following conditions is met:

            (i) the Holders of Series 2003-A Notes evidencing at least 90% of
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes have
      notified the



                                      19
<PAGE>

      Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put Feature in
      respect of their Series 2003-A Notes; or

            (ii) the Majority Holders of the Series 2003-A Notes have notified
      the Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put Feature in
      respect of their Series 2003-A Notes and the net proceeds of the sale of
      Receivables pursuant to such exercise (as described below) plus amounts
      on deposit in the Principal Funding Account would be sufficient to pay
      all amounts due on the Series 2003-A Notes; or

            (iii) (A) the Indenture Trustee determines that the funds to be
      allocated to the Series 2003-A Notes, including (1) Series 2003-A
      Available Interest Amounts and Series 2003-A Available Principal Amounts
      and (2) amounts on deposit in the Principal Funding Account, may not be
      sufficient on an ongoing basis to make payments on the Series 2003-A
      Notes as such payments would have become due if such obligations had not
      been declared due and payable and (B) Holders of Series 2003-A Notes
      evidencing at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount
      of the Series 2003-A Notes have notified the Indenture Trustee that they
      desire to exercise the Put Feature in respect of their Series 2003-A
      Notes.

If the Put Feature is deemed to be exercised as provided in the preceding
sentence, it shall be deemed to be exercised by all Holders of the Series
2003-A Notes, whether or not they actually give notice of their desire to
exercise the Put Feature. Upon such deemed exercise of the Put Feature, the
Indenture Trustee shall cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the
related Non-Principal Receivables (or interests therein) in an amount up to
the Series 2003-A Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2003-A Notes. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture. The Holders of the Series 2003-A Notes
shall maintain their rights in their Series 2003-A Notes until such sale
proceeds have been applied in accordance with Section 706 of the Indenture and
shall present their Series 2003-A Notes to the Issuer in accordance with
Section 706 of the Indenture as part of their exercise of the Put Feature.

            (b) If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes
is greater than zero on the Legal Maturity Date (after giving effect to
deposits and distributions otherwise to be made on the Legal Maturity Date),
the Issuer will cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the related
Non-Principal Receivables on the Legal Maturity Date in an amount up to the
Series 2003-A Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2003-A Notes; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that in no
event shall the amount of Principal Receivables so sold by the Issuer exceed
the Series 2003-A Nominal Liquidation Amount.

            (c) Sales proceeds received with respect to the Series 2003-A
Notes pursuant to clause (b) above will be allocated in the following
priority:

            (i) first, to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account, an
      amount up to the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
      Series 2003-A Notes immediately before giving effect to such deposit;
      and



                                      20
<PAGE>

            (ii) second, to be deposited in the Interest Funding Account, the
      balance of such sales proceeds.

            (d) Any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Funding
Account after a sale of Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.15 and the
final payment of the Series 2003-A Notes pursuant to Section 503 of the
Indenture, will be treated as part of the Series 2003-A Available Interest
Amount.

            Section 3.16. Calculation Agent; Determination of LIBOR.

            (a) The Issuer hereby agrees that for so long as any Series 2003-A
Notes are Outstanding, there shall at all times be an agent appointed to
calculate LIBOR for each Interest Period (the "Calculation Agent"). The Issuer
hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee as the Calculation Agent for
purposes of determining LIBOR for each Interest Period. The Calculation Agent
may be removed by the Issuer at any time. If the Calculation Agent is unable
or unwilling to act as such or is removed by the Issuer, or if the Calculation
Agent fails to determine LIBOR for an Interest Period, the Issuer shall
promptly appoint a replacement Calculation Agent that does not control or is
not controlled by or under common control with the Issuer or its Affiliates.
The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties, and the Issuer may not remove
the Calculation Agent, without a successor having been duly appointed and
having accepted such appointment.

            (b) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
determine LIBOR for the following Interest Period to equal the offered rate
for United States dollar deposits for one month that appears on Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such date. If that rate appears on
Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR will be that rate. If on any LIBOR Determination
Date the offered rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation
Agent will request each of the Reference Banks, to provide the Calculation
Agent with its offered quotation for United States dollar deposits for one
month to prime banks in the London interbank market as of 11:00 A.M., London
time, on the date. If at least two Reference Banks provide the Calculation
Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the arithmetic
mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
all the quotations. If on that date fewer than two Reference Banks provide the
Calculation Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the
arithmetic mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
the offered per annum rates that one or more leading banks in The City of New
York selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as of 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on that date to leading European banks for United States dollar
deposits for one month. If, however, those banks are not quoting as described
above, LIBOR for that date will be LIBOR applicable to the Interest Period
immediately preceding that Interest Period.

            (c) The Series 2003-A Note Interest Rate, applicable to the then
current and the immediately preceding Interest Periods, may be obtained by
telephoning the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office at (212)
328-7623 or such other telephone number as shall be designated by the
Indenture Trustee for such purpose by prior written notice by the Indenture
Trustee to each Series 2003-A Noteholder from time to time.



                                      21
<PAGE>

            (d) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
send to the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and the Seller, by facsimile
transmission, notification of LIBOR for the following Interest Period.

            Section 3.17.  Excess Available Interest Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2003-A on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2003-A Available Interest Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2003-A with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2003-A Available Interest Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2003-A on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Series 2003-A Available Interest Amount
Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for all series
of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Interest Amount that is not
required to be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of
Notes shall be released to the Issuer for distribution in respect of the
Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

            Section 3.18.  Excess Available Principal Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2003-A on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2003-A Available Principal Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2003-A with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2003-A Available Principal Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2003-A on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Series 2003-A Available Principal
Amount Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for
all series of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Principal Amount not required to
be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of Notes shall
be applied as Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to Section 4.06 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

            Section 3.19.  Computation of Interest.

            (a) Interest on the Series 2003-A Notes shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the related
Interest Period.

            (b) Unless otherwise specified in this Indenture Supplement,
interest for any period will be calculated from and including the first day of
such period to and including the last day of such period.

            Section 3.20.  Variable Accumulation Period.

            The Issuer, acting directly or through the Administrator, may
elect, by written notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Beneficiary, to
delay, from time to time, the commencement of the Accumulation Period, and
extend the length of the Revolving Period, subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 3.20; provided, however, that the Accumulation Period shall
commence no later than the first day of the Monthly Period ending immediately
prior to the Series 2003-A Expected Final Payment Date. Any such election by
the Issuer shall be made not later than the first day of the last scheduled
Monthly Period of the Revolving Period (including any prior extension of the
Revolving Period pursuant to this Section 3.20). The Issuer may make such
election only if the following conditions are satisfied:

            (i) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee a
      certificate to the effect that the Issuer reasonably believes that the
      delay in the commencement of the Accumulation Period would not result in
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes not
      being paid in full on the Series 2003-A Expected Principal Payment Date;

            (ii) the Note Rating Agencies shall have advised the Issuer that
      such election to delay the commencement of the Accumulation Period would
      not cause the rating of any class of any series of Notes then
      outstanding to be lowered or withdrawn; and

            (iii) the amount to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account
      in respect of Controlled Accumulation Amount shall have been adjusted.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Indenture to the contrary, the
Administrator may, on behalf of the Issuer, (i) perform all such calculations
as are necessary to determine whether the Accumulation Period may be delayed
pursuant to this Section 3.20 and (ii) elect to delay the Accumulation Period
pursuant to this Section 3.20.

            Section 3.21. Payments to the Issuer. As an administrative
convenience for the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Seller all
amounts payable or to be released hereunder to the Issuer. The Issuer shall
give the Indenture Trustee written instructions as to who the Seller is and
where to make such payments.

            Section 3.22. Payment Instructions and Monthly Noteholders'
Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary,
the Issuer may amend the form of Payment Instruction for the Series 2003-A
Notes and the Series 2003-A Schedule to Monthly Noteholders' Statement from
time to time without the consent of the Indenture Trustee



                                      23
<PAGE>

or any Noteholder if it receives written confirmation from each Note Rating
Agency that such amendment will not cause a Ratings Effect.

      deposit (including any Transfer Deposit Amount or Adjustment Payment)
      required by the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the
      Receivables Purchase Agreement on or before the date occurring two
      Business Days after the date such payment or deposit is required to be
      made therein, or (ii) to deliver a Monthly Noteholders' Statement or
      Payment Instruction within five Business Days of the day such item is

      agreements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, set forth
      in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Receivables Purchase
      Agreement, which failure in the case of this subclause (iv) continues
      unremedied for a period of 45 days after the date on which written
      notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
      been given to the Seller by the Indenture Trustee;

            (2) any representation or warranty made by DCS in the Receivables

      delivered, and shall continue to be incorrect in any material respect
      for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of such
      failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
      Seller by the Indenture Trustee and (ii) as a result of such
      incorrectness the interests of the Series 2003-A Noteholders are
      materially and adversely affected; provided, however, that an Early
      Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2003-A Notes shall not be
      deemed to have occurred under this clause (2) if the Seller has
      repurchased the related Receivable or all such Receivables, if
      applicable, during such period in accordance with the provisions of the
      Sale and Servicing Agreement;

            (3) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
      Seller, DCS or DaimlerChrysler;



                                      24
<PAGE>

            (4) a failure by the Seller to convey Receivables in Additional
      Accounts to the Issuer within five Business Days after the day on which
      it is required to convey such Receivables pursuant to the Sale and
      Servicing Agreement;

            (5) on any Payment Date, the Primary Overcollateralization Amount
      for such Payment Date is reduced to an amount less than the Required
      Primary Overcollateralization Amount on that Payment Date after giving
      effect to the distributions to be made on such Payment Date; provided
      that, for the purpose of determining whether an Early Redemption Event
      has occurred pursuant to this clause (5), any reduction of the Primary
      Overcollateralization Amount resulting from reallocations of the Series
      2003-A Available Principal Amounts to pay interest on the Series 2003-A
      Notes in the event LIBOR is equal to or greater than the prime rate upon
      which interest on the Receivables is calculated on the applicable LIBOR
      Determination Date will be considered an Early Redemption Event only if
      LIBOR remains equal to or greater than such prime rate for the next 30
      consecutive days following such LIBOR Determination Date;

            (6) any Service Default occurs;

            (7) on any Determination Date, as of the last day of the preceding
      Collection Period, the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
      relating to Used Vehicles exceeds 20% of the Pool Balance on that last
      day;

            (8) on any Determination Date, the average of the Monthly Payment
      Rates for the three preceding Collection Periods is less than 20%;

            (9) the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2003-A
      Notes is not repaid by the Series 2003-A Expected Principal Payment
      Date;

            (10) the Seller or the Issuer becomes an investment company within
      the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

            (11) the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the
      Series 2003-A Notes.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, in the case of
any event described in clause (1), (2) or (6) above, an Early Redemption Event
with respect to Series 2003-A will be deemed to have occurred only if, after
the applicable grace period described in such clause, if any, either the
Indenture Trustee or Series 2003-A Noteholders holding Series 2003-A Notes
evidencing more than 50% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2003-A Notes by written notice to the Seller, the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, if given by Series 2003-A Noteholders, declare that an
Early Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2003-A Notes has occurred as
of the date of that notice. In the case of any Early Redemption Event
described in clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (11) above, an Early
Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2003-A Notes shall be deemed to
have occurred without any notice or other action on the part of the Indenture
Trustee or the Series 2003-A Noteholders immediately upon the occurrence of
such event.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if (x) an
Early Redemption Period results from the failure by DCWR to convey Receivables
in Additional Accounts to the Issuer, as described in clause (4) above during
the Revolving Period, (y) no other Early Redemption Event that has not been
cured or waived in accordance with the Indenture has occurred and (z) each
Note Rating Agency has confirmed that recommencing the Revolving Period will
not cause a Ratings Effect, then the Early Redemption Period resulting from
such failure will terminate and the Revolving Period will recommence as of the
end of the first Collection Period during which the Seller would no longer be
required to convey Receivables in Additional Accounts to the Issuer; provided
that the Revolving Period will not recommence if the scheduled termination
date of the Revolving Period has occurred.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if an Early
Redemption Event (other than an Early Redemption Event specified in clause (3)
or (10) above) has occurred and the scheduled termination of the Revolving
Period has not occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall request from Standard &
Poor's a confirmation that such Early Redemption Event will not cause a
Ratings Effect. If the Indenture Trustee receives such confirmation and the
Majority Holders of Series 2003-A Notes consent to the recommencement of the
Revolving Period, the related Early Redemption Period shall terminate and the
Revolving Period shall recommence.

            Section 5.01.  Accounts.

            (a) Accounts; Deposits to and Distributions from Accounts. On or
before the Issuance Date, the Indenture Trustee will cause to be established
and maintained two Qualified Accounts denominated as follows: the "Interest
Funding Account" and the "Principal Funding Account" (collectively, the
"Series 2003-A Accounts") in the name of the Indenture Trustee, bearing a
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for
the benefit of the Series 2003-A Noteholders. The Series 2003-A Accounts
constitute Supplemental Accounts and shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2003-A
Noteholders. If, at any time, the institution holding any Series 2003-A
Account ceases to be a Qualified Institution, the Issuer will within ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
as to which each Note Rating Agency may consent) establish a new applicable
Series 2003-A Account, that is a Qualified Account and shall transfer any cash
and/or investments to such new Series 2003-A Account. From the date such new
Series 2003-A Account is established, it will be a Series 2003-A Account,
bearing the name of the Series 2003-A Account it has replaced.

            (b) All payments to be made from time to time by the Indenture
Trustee to Series 2003-A Noteholders out of funds in the Series 2003-A
Accounts pursuant to this Indenture Supplement will be made by the Indenture
Trustee to the Paying Agent not later than 12:00 noon on the applicable
Interest Payment Date or Principal Payment Date but only to the extent of
funds in the applicable Series 2003-A Account or as otherwise provided in
Article III.

                               [REVERSE OF NOTE]

            This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the
Issuer, designated as its Floating Rate Auto Dealer Loan Asset Backed Notes,
Series 2003-A (the "Notes" or "Series 2003-A Notes"), all issued under an
Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended,
restated and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), as supplemented
by an Amended and Restated Series 2003-A Indenture Supplement, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time,
the "Indenture Supplement"), each between the Issuer and The Bank of New York,
as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee," which term includes any
successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Notes are subject to all terms of
the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement. All terms used in this Note that
are defined in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement, each as supplemented
or amended, shall have the meanings assigned to them in or pursuant to the
Indenture or the Indenture Supplement.

            The Notes are and will be equally and ratably secured by the
collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.

            Principal of the Notes will be payable on the Expected Principal
Payment Date in an amount described on the face hereof. Upon the occurrence of
certain events specified in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement,
payments of principal of the Notes may be made prior to or after the Expected
Principal Payment Date.

            As described above, the entire unpaid principal amount of this
Note shall be due and payable on the Legal Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes may be due and
payable following an Event of Default in the manner provided in Section 702 of
the Indenture; provided, however, that such acceleration of the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes may be rescinded by the holders of not less than
a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes. All
principal payments on the Notes shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders
entitled thereto.

            On any day occurring on or after the date on which the aggregate
Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes is reduced to less than
10% of the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2003-A Notes, the
Servicer has the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Issuer to redeem
the Series 2003-A Notes in whole but not in part, pursuant to Section 1202 of
the Indenture equal the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series
2003-A Notes, plus interest accrued and unpaid to but excluding the date of
redemption.

            Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the
Beneficiary may, from time to time, direct the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the
Issuer, to issue one or more series or classes of notes.

            On each Payment Date, the Paying Agent shall distribute to each
Series 2003-A Noteholder of record on the related Record Date (except for the
final distribution with respect to this Note) such Series 2003-A Noteholder's
pro rata share of the amounts held by the Paying



                                     A-4
<PAGE>

Agent that are allocated and available on such Payment Date to pay interest
and principal on the Series 2003-A Notes. Final payments of this Note will be
made only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the office or
offices therein specified.

            Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Payment
Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in
full payment of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to the Person whose
name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor
Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date,
except that with respect to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of
the nominee of the clearing agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.),
payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account designated by such nominee. Such checks shall be mailed to the Person
entitled thereto at the address of such Person as it appears on the Note
Register as of the applicable Record Date without requiring that this Note be
submitted for notation of payment. Any reduction in the principal amount of
this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made
on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and
of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon. If funds are expected
to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then
remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a Payment Date, then the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the
Person who was the Registered Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding
such Payment Date by notice mailed within five days of such Payment Date and
the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee's principal Corporate Trust
Office or at the office of the Indenture Trustee's agent appointed for such
purposes located in the City of New York.

            As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note
Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company located, or having a correspondent located,
in the City of New York or the city in which the Corporate Trust Office is
located, or a member firm of a national securities exchange, and such other
documents as the Indenture Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new
Notes of authorized denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge
will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but
the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer or exchange.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and agrees
that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the
obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the
Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in
connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the
Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner,



                                     A-5
<PAGE>

beneficiary, agent, officer, director or employee of the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any
successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed and
except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to
the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock,
unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to
such entity.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
that by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that it will not at any time
institute against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or the Issuer, or
join in any institution against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or
the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States Federal
or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating
to the Notes, the Indenture or any Derivative Agreement.

            Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this
Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note (as of the day
of determination or as of such other date as may be specified in the
Indenture) is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the
Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Holders of Notes
representing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of all Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of Notes representing specified percentages
of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or
any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The
Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms

            Overcollateralization Amount Deficit pursuant to Section 3.01(e)
            that have been allocated to the Overcollateralization Amount
            pursuant to Section 3.04(b) since the Issuance Date; minus

                  (C) the aggregate amount of all reallocations of the Series
            2004-A Available Principal Amount pursuant to Section 3.05(a) that
            have been allocated to the Overcollateralization Amount pursuant
            to Section 3.06(a) since the Issuance Date; minus

                  (D) the aggregate amount of all reductions of the
            Overcollateralization Amount resulting from an allocation of
            Investor Charge-Offs to the



                                      18
<PAGE>

            Overcollateralization Amount pursuant to Section 3.03(a) since the
            Issuance Date; plus

                  (E) the Incremental Overcollateralization Amount;

provided, however, that the Overcollateralization Amount shall never be less
than zero and, after the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series
2004-A Notes has been reduced to zero, the Overcollateralization Amount shall
be zero.

            SECTION 3.13. Netting of Deposits and Payments. The Issuer, in its
sole discretion, may make all deposits to the Interest Funding Account and the
Principal Funding Account pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.07 with respect to
any Payment Date net of, and after giving effect to, (a) all reallocations to
be made pursuant to Section 3.07 and (b) all payments to the Issuer pursuant
to Section 3.05.

            SECTION 3.14.  Payments to Noteholders.

            (a) All payments of principal, interest or other amounts to
Holders of the Series 2004-A Notes will be made pro rata based on the Stated
Principal Amount of their Series 2004-A Notes.

            (b) Any installment of interest or principal, if any, payable on
any Series 2004-A Note which is punctually paid or duly provided for by the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee on the applicable Interest Payment Date or
Principal Payment Date shall be paid by the Paying Agent to the Person in
whose name such Series 2004-A Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is
registered on the Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such Person's account as has been designated by written instructions
received by the Paying Agent from such Person not later than the close of
business on the third Business Day preceding the date of payment or, if no
such account has been so designated, by check mailed first-class, postage
prepaid to such Person's address as it appears on the Note Register on such
Record Date, except that (i) with respect to Series 2004-A Notes registered on
the Record Date in the name of the nominee of Cede & Co., payment shall be
made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated
by such nominee and (ii) with regard to any payments of interest or principal
made pursuant to Section 3.09(b) or 3.10(b), respectively, payment shall be
made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated
by the Issuer.

            (c) The right of the Series 2004-A Noteholders to receive payments
from the Issuer will terminate on the first Business Day following the Series
2004-A Termination Date.

            SECTION 3.15.  Exercise of Put Feature; Sale of Receivables for
Accelerated Notes.

            (a) If (i) an Early Redemption Event specified in Section 4.01(3)
of this Indenture Supplement occurs or (ii) the Series 2004-A Notes have been
accelerated pursuant to Section 702 of the Indenture following an Event of
Default, each Holder of a Series 2004-A Note may notify the Indenture Trustee
that it desires to exercise the Put Feature in respect of its Series 2004-A
Notes. The Put Feature shall be deemed to be exercised only if at least one of
the following conditions is met:



                                      19
<PAGE>

            (i) the Holders of Series 2004-A Notes evidencing at least 90% of
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-A Notes have
      notified the Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put
      Feature in respect of their Series 2004-A Notes; or

            (ii) the Majority Holders of the Series 2004-A Notes have notified
      the Indenture Trustee that they desire to exercise the Put Feature in
      respect of their Series 2004-A Notes and the net proceeds of the sale of
      Receivables pursuant to such exercise (as described below) plus amounts
      on deposit in the Principal Funding Account would be sufficient to pay
      all amounts due on the Series 2004-A Notes; or

            (iii) (A) the Indenture Trustee determines that the funds to be
      allocated to the Series 2004-A Notes, including (1) Series 2004-A
      Available Interest Amounts and Series 2004-A Available Principal Amounts
      and (2) amounts on deposit in the Principal Funding Account, may not be
      sufficient on an ongoing basis to make payments on the Series 2004-A
      Notes as such payments would have become due if such obligations had not
      been declared due and payable and (B) Holders of Series 2004-A Notes
      evidencing at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount
      of the Series 2004-A Notes have notified the Indenture Trustee that they
      desire to exercise the Put Feature in respect of their Series 2004-A
      Notes.

If the Put Feature is deemed to be exercised as provided in the preceding
sentence, it shall be deemed to be exercised by all Holders of the Series
2004-A Notes, whether or not they actually give notice of their desire to
exercise the Put Feature. Upon such deemed exercise of the Put Feature, the
Indenture Trustee shall cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the
related Non-Principal Receivables (or interests therein) in an amount up to
the Series 2004-A Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2004-A Notes. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture. The Holders of the Series 2004-A Notes
shall maintain their rights in their Series 2004-A Notes until such sale
proceeds have been applied in accordance with Section 706 of the Indenture and
shall present their Series 2004-A Notes to the Issuer in accordance with
Section 706 of the Indenture as part of their exercise of the Put Feature.

            (b) If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-A Notes
is greater than zero on the Legal Maturity Date (after giving effect to
deposits and distributions otherwise to be made on the Legal Maturity Date),
the Issuer will cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the related
Non-Principal Receivables on the Legal Maturity Date in an amount up to the
Series 2004-A Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2004-A Notes; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that in no
event shall the amount of Principal Receivables so sold by the Issuer exceed
the Series 2004-A Nominal Liquidation Amount.

            (c) Sales proceeds received with respect to the Series 2004-A
Notes pursuant to clause (b) above will be allocated in the following
priority:



                                      20
<PAGE>

            (i) first, to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account, an
      amount up to the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
      Series 2004-A Notes immediately before giving effect to such deposit;
      and

            (ii) second, to be deposited in the Interest Funding Account, the
      balance of such sales proceeds.

            (d) Any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Funding
Account after a sale of Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.15 and the
final payment of the Series 2004-A Notes pursuant to Section 503 of the
Indenture, will be treated as part of the Series 2004-A Available Interest
Amount.

            SECTION 3.16. Calculation Agent; Determination of LIBOR.

            (a) The Issuer hereby agrees that for so long as any Series 2004-A
Notes are Outstanding, there shall at all times be an agent appointed to
calculate LIBOR for each Interest Period (the "Calculation Agent"). The Issuer
hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee as the Calculation Agent for
purposes of determining LIBOR for each Interest Period. The Calculation Agent
may be removed by the Issuer at any time. If the Calculation Agent is unable
or unwilling to act as such or is removed by the Issuer, or if the Calculation
Agent fails to determine LIBOR for an Interest Period, the Issuer shall
promptly appoint a replacement Calculation Agent that does not control or is
not controlled by or under common control with the Issuer or its Affiliates.
The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties, and the Issuer may not remove
the Calculation Agent, without a successor having been duly appointed and
having accepted such appointment.

            (b) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
determine LIBOR for the following Interest Period to equal the offered rate
for United States dollar deposits for one month that appears on Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such date. If that rate appears on
Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR will be that rate. If on any LIBOR Determination
Date the offered rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation
Agent will request each of the Reference Banks, to provide the Calculation
Agent with its offered quotation for United States dollar deposits for one
month to prime banks in the London interbank market as of 11:00 A.M., London
time, on the date. If at least two Reference Banks provide the Calculation
Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the arithmetic
mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
all the quotations. If on that date fewer than two Reference Banks provide the
Calculation Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the
arithmetic mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
the offered per annum rates that one or more leading banks in The City of New
York selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as of 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on that date to leading European banks for United States dollar
deposits for one month. If, however, those banks are not quoting as described
above, LIBOR for that date will be LIBOR applicable to the Interest Period
immediately preceding that Interest Period.



                                      21
<PAGE>

            (c) The Series 2004-A Note Interest Rate, applicable to the then
current and the immediately preceding Interest Periods, may be obtained by
telephoning the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office at (212)
328-7623 or such other telephone number as shall be designated by the
Indenture Trustee for such purpose by prior written notice by the Indenture
Trustee to each Series 2004-A Noteholder from time to time.

            (d) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
send to the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and the Seller, by facsimile
transmission, notification of LIBOR for the following Interest Period.

            SECTION 3.17.  Excess Available Interest Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2004-A on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2004-A Available Interest Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2004-A with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2004-A Available Interest Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2004-A on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Series 2004-A Available Interest Amount
Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for all series
of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Interest Amount that is not
required to be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of
Notes shall be released to the Issuer for distribution in respect of the
Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

            SECTION 3.18.  Excess Available Principal Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2004-A on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2004-A Available Principal Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2004-A with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2004-A Available Principal Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2004-A on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Series 2004-A Available Principal
Amount Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the



                                      22
<PAGE>


aggregate amount of Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for
all series of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Principal Amount not required to
be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of Notes shall
be applied as Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to Section 4.06 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

            SECTION 3.19.  Computation of Interest.

            (a) Interest on the Series 2004-A Notes shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the related
Interest Period.

            (b) Unless otherwise specified in this Indenture Supplement,
interest for any period will be calculated from and including the first day of
such period to and including the last day of such period.

            SECTION 3.20.  Variable Accumulation Period.

            The Issuer, acting directly or through the Administrator, may
elect, by written notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Beneficiary, to
delay, from time to time, the commencement of the Accumulation Period, and
extend the length of the Revolving Period, subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 3.20; provided, however, that the Accumulation Period shall
commence no later than the first day of the Monthly Period ending immediately
prior to the Series 2004-A Expected Final Payment Date. Any such election by
the Issuer shall be made not later than the first day of the last scheduled
Monthly Period of the Revolving Period (including any prior extension of the
Revolving Period pursuant to this Section 3.20). The Issuer may make such
election only if the following conditions are satisfied:

            (i) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee a
      certificate to the effect that the Issuer reasonably believes that the
      delay in the commencement of the Accumulation Period would not result in
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-A Notes not
      being paid in full on the Series 2004-A Expected Principal Payment Date;

            (ii) the Note Rating Agencies shall have advised the Issuer that
      such election to delay the commencement of the Accumulation Period would
      not cause the rating of any class of any series of Notes then
      outstanding to be lowered or withdrawn; and

            (iii) the amount to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account
      in respect of Controlled Accumulation Amount shall have been adjusted.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Indenture to the contrary, the
Administrator may, on behalf of the Issuer, (i) perform all such calculations
as are necessary to determine whether the Accumulation Period may be delayed
pursuant to this Section 3.20 and (ii) elect to delay the Accumulation Period
pursuant to this Section 3.20.

            SECTION 3.21. Payments to the Issuer. As an administrative
convenience for the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Seller all
amounts payable or to be released



                                      23
<PAGE>

hereunder to the Issuer. The Issuer shall give the Indenture Trustee written
instructions as to who the Seller is and where to make such payments.

            SECTION 3.22. Payment Instructions and Monthly Noteholders'
Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary,
the Issuer may amend the form of Payment Instruction for the Series 2004-A
Notes and the Series 2004-A Schedule to Monthly Noteholders' Statement from
time to time without the consent of the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder if
it receives written confirmation from each Note Rating Agency that such
amendment will not cause a Ratings Effect.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                           EARLY REDEMPTION OF NOTES

            SECTION 4.01. Early Redemption Events. In addition to the events
identified as Early Redemption Events in Section 1201 of the Indenture, each
of the following events will also be an Early Redemption Event with respect to
the Series 2004-A Notes:

            (1) failure on the part of the Seller, the Servicer or DCS (if DCS
      is no longer the Servicer), as applicable, (i) to make any payment or
      deposit (including any Transfer Deposit Amount or Adjustment Payment)
      required by the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the
      Receivables Purchase Agreement on or before the date occurring two
      Business Days after the date such payment or deposit is required to be
      made therein, or (ii) to deliver a Monthly Noteholders' Statement or
      Payment Instruction within five Business Days of the day such item is
      due to be delivered under the Indenture, or (iii) duly to observe or
      perform in any material respect the covenant of the Seller set forth in
      Section 2.06(a) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or (iv) duly to
      observe or perform in any material respect any other covenants or
      agreements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, set forth
      in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Receivables Purchase
      Agreement, which failure in the case of this subclause (iv) continues
      unremedied for a period of 45 days after the date on which written
      notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
      been given to the Seller by the Indenture Trustee;

            (2) any representation or warranty made by DCS in the Receivables
      Purchase Agreement or the Seller in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or
      any information contained in a computer file or microfiche or written
      list required to be delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section 2.01,
      2.05, 2.07 or 2.08 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, (i) shall prove
      to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or when
      delivered, and shall continue to be incorrect in any material respect
      for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of such
      failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
      Seller by the Indenture Trustee and (ii) as a result of such
      incorrectness the interests of the Series 2004-A Noteholders are
      materially and adversely affected; provided, however, that an Early
      Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2004-A Notes shall not be
      deemed to have occurred under this clause (2) if the Seller has
      repurchased the related Receivable or all such Receivables, if
      applicable,


                                      24
<PAGE>

      during such period in accordance with the provisions of the Sale and
      Servicing Agreement;

            (3) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
      Seller, DCS or DaimlerChrysler;

            (4) a failure by the Seller to convey Receivables in Additional
      Accounts to the Issuer within five Business Days after the day on which
      it is required to convey such Receivables pursuant to the Sale and
      Servicing Agreement;

            (5) on any Payment Date, the Primary Overcollateralization Amount
      for such Payment Date is reduced to an amount less than the Required
      Primary Overcollateralization Amount on that Payment Date after giving
      effect to the distributions to be made on such Payment Date; provided
      that, for the purpose of determining whether an Early Redemption Event
      has occurred pursuant to this clause (5), any reduction of the Primary
      Overcollateralization Amount resulting from reallocations of the Series
      2004-A Available Principal Amounts to pay interest on the Series 2004-A
      Notes in the event LIBOR is equal to or greater than the prime rate upon
      which interest on the Receivables is calculated on the applicable LIBOR
      Determination Date will be considered an Early Redemption Event only if
      LIBOR remains equal to or greater than such prime rate for the next 30
      consecutive days following such LIBOR Determination Date;

            (6) any Service Default occurs;

            (7) on any Determination Date, as of the last day of the preceding
      Collection Period, the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
      relating to Used Vehicles exceeds 20% of the Pool Balance on that last
      day;

            (8) on any Determination Date, the average of the Monthly Payment
      Rates for the three preceding Collection Periods is less than 20%;

            (9) the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-A
      Notes is not repaid by the Series 2004-A Expected Principal Payment
      Date;

            (10) the Seller or the Issuer becomes an investment company within
      the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

            (11) the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the
      Series 2004-A Notes.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, in the case of
any event described in clause (1), (2) or (6) above, an Early Redemption Event
with respect to Series 2004-A will be deemed to have occurred only if, after
the applicable grace period described in such clause, if any, either the
Indenture Trustee or Series 2004-A Noteholders holding Series 2004-A Notes
evidencing more than 50% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2004-A Notes by written notice to the Seller, the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, if given by Series 2004-A Noteholders, declare that an
Early Redemption Event with respect to the Series



                                      25
<PAGE>

2004-A Notes has occurred as of the date of that notice. In the case of any
Early Redemption Event described in clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10)
or (11) above, an Early Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2004-A
Notes shall be deemed to have occurred without any notice or other action on
the part of the Indenture Trustee or the Series 2004-A Noteholders immediately
upon the occurrence of such event.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if (x) an
Early Redemption Period results from the failure by DCWR to convey Receivables
in Additional Accounts to the Issuer, as described in clause (4) above during
the Revolving Period, (y) no other Early Redemption Event that has not been
cured or waived in accordance with the Indenture has occurred and (z) each
Note Rating Agency has confirmed that recommencing the Revolving Period will
not cause a Ratings Effect, then the Early Redemption Period resulting from
such failure will terminate and the Revolving Period will recommence as of the
end of the first Collection Period during which the Seller would no longer be
required to convey Receivables in Additional Accounts to the Issuer; provided
that the Revolving Period will not recommence if the scheduled termination
date of the Revolving Period has occurred.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if an Early
Redemption Event (other than an Early Redemption Event specified in clause (3)
or (10) above) has occurred and the scheduled termination of the Revolving
Period has not occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall request from Standard &
Poor's a confirmation that such Early Redemption Event will not cause a
Ratings Effect. If the Indenture Trustee receives such confirmation and the
Majority Holders of Series 2004-A Notes consent to the recommencement of the
Revolving Period, the related Early Redemption Period shall terminate and the
Revolving Period shall recommence.

                                   ARTICLE V

                           ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS

            SECTION 5.01.  Accounts.

            (a) Accounts; Deposits to and Distributions from Accounts. On or
before the Issuance Date, the Indenture Trustee will cause to be established
and maintained two Qualified Accounts denominated as follows: the "Interest
Funding Account" and the "Principal Funding Account" (collectively, the
"Series 2004-A Accounts") in the name of the Indenture Trustee, bearing a
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for
the benefit of the Series 2004-A Noteholders. The Series 2004-A Accounts
constitute Supplemental Accounts and shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2004-A
Noteholders. If, at any time, the institution holding any Series 2004-A
Account ceases to be a Qualified Institution, the Issuer will within ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
as to which each Note Rating Agency may consent) establish a new applicable

                               [REVERSE OF NOTE]

            This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the
Issuer, designated as its Floating Rate Auto Dealer Loan Asset Backed Notes,
Series 2004-A (the "Notes" or "Series 2004-A Notes"), all issued under an
Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended,
restated and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), as supplemented
by an Amended and Restated Series 2004-A Indenture Supplement, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time,
the "Indenture Supplement"), each between the Issuer and The Bank of New York,
as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee," which term includes any
successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Notes are subject to all terms of
the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement. All terms used in this Note that
are defined in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement, each as supplemented
or amended, shall have the meanings assigned to them in or pursuant to the
Indenture or the Indenture Supplement.

            The Notes are and will be equally and ratably secured by the
collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.

            Principal of the Notes will be payable on the Expected Principal
Payment Date in an amount described on the face hereof. Upon the occurrence of
certain events specified in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement,
payments of principal of the Notes may be made prior to or after the Expected
Principal Payment Date.

            As described above, the entire unpaid principal amount of this
Note shall be due and payable on the Legal Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes may be due and
payable following an Event of Default in the manner provided in Section 702 of
the Indenture; provided, however, that such acceleration of the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes may be rescinded by the holders of not less than
a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes. All
principal payments on the Notes shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders
entitled thereto.

            On any day occurring on or after the date on which the aggregate
Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-A Notes is reduced to less than
10% of the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-A Notes, the
Servicer has the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Issuer to redeem
the Series 2004-A Notes in whole but not in part, pursuant to Section 1202 of
the Indenture equal the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series
2004-A Notes, plus interest accrued and unpaid to but excluding the date of
redemption.

            Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the
Beneficiary may, from time to time, direct the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the
Issuer, to issue one or more series or classes of notes.

            On each Payment Date, the Paying Agent shall distribute to each
Series 2004-A Noteholder of record on the related Record Date (except for the
final distribution with respect to this Note) such Series 2004-A Noteholder's
pro rata share of the amounts held by the Paying



                                     A-4
<PAGE>

Agent that are allocated and available on such Payment Date to pay interest
and principal on the Series 2004-A Notes. Final payments of this Note will be
made only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the office or
offices therein specified.

            Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Payment
Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in
full payment of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to the Person whose
name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor
Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date,
except that with respect to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of
the nominee of the clearing agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.),
payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account designated by such nominee. Such checks shall be mailed to the Person
entitled thereto at the address of such Person as it appears on the Note
Register as of the applicable Record Date without requiring that this Note be
submitted for notation of payment. Any reduction in the principal amount of
this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made
on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and
of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon. If funds are expected
to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then
remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a Payment Date, then the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the
Person who was the Registered Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding
such Payment Date by notice mailed within five days of such Payment Date and
the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee's principal Corporate Trust
Office or at the office of the Indenture Trustee's agent appointed for such
purposes located in the City of New York.

            As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note
Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company located, or having a correspondent located,
in the City of New York or the city in which the Corporate Trust Office is
located, or a member firm of a national securities exchange, and such other
documents as the Indenture Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new
Notes of authorized denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge
will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but
the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer or exchange.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and agrees
that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the
obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the
Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in
connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the
Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner,



                                     A-5
<PAGE>

beneficiary, agent, officer, director or employee of the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any
successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed and
except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to
the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock,
unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to
such entity.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
that by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that it will not at any time
institute against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or the Issuer, or
join in any institution against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or
the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States Federal
or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating
to the Notes, the Indenture or any Derivative Agreement.

            Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this
Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note (as of the day
of determination or as of such other date as may be specified in the
Indenture) is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the
Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Holders of Notes
representing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of all Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of Notes representing specified percentages
of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or
any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The
Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms
and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the consent of Holders of
the Notes issued thereunder.

            The term "Issuer" as used in this Note includes any successor to
the Issuer under the Indenture.

            The Issuer is permitted by the Indenture, under certain
circumstances, to merge or consolidate, subject to the rights of the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of Notes under the Indenture.

            The Notes are issuable only in registered form in denominations as

YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION
5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW) AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS
AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency herein
prescribed.

individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed (it
being understood that the Owner Trustee has no such obligations in its
individual capacity). The Holder of this Note by the acceptance hereof agrees
that, except as expressly provided in the Indenture and the Indenture
Supplement in the case of an Event of Default under the Indenture, the Holder
shall have no claim against any of the foregoing for any deficiency, loss or

            (b) Receivables Sales Proceeds. Receivables Sales Proceeds

      date of receipt by the Issuer.

            SECTION 3.03. Allocations of Reductions from Investor Charge-Offs
to the Overcollateralization Amount and the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the
Series 2004-B Notes. On each Payment Date when there is an Investor Charge-Off

(i) such Investor Charge-Off and (ii) the Overcollateralization Amount
(computed prior to giving effect to such Investor Charge-Off and any
reallocation of Series 2004-B Available Principal Amount on such date). In
such case, the Overcollateralization Amount will be reduced by an amount equal

Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes will be reduced by an amount
equal to the portion of such Investor Charge-Off that is allocated to the
Series 2004-B Notes pursuant to this clause (b); provided, however, that no
such allocation will reduce the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series
2004-B Notes below zero.

            SECTION 3.04. Allocations of Reimbursements of Nominal Liquidation
Amount Deficit and Overcollateralization Amount Deficit. If, as of any Payment
Date, there is any Series 2004-B Available Interest Amount available pursuant
to Section 3.01(e) to reimburse any Nominal Liquidation Amount Deficit or
Overcollateralization Amount Deficit as of such Payment Date, such funds will
be allocated as follows:

            (a) first, to the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-B
Notes, but in no event will the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series
2004-B Notes be increased above the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes; and

            (b) second, to the Overcollateralization Amount, but in no event
will the Overcollateralization Amount be increased above the

Amount. On each Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee will apply the Series

            (a) first, if, after giving effect to deposits to be made with
respect to such Payment Date pursuant to Section 3.01(b), the Series 2004-B
Notes have not received the full amount targeted to be deposited pursuant to
Section 3.01(b) with respect to that Payment Date, then the Series 2004-B
Available Principal Amount will be allocated to the Interest Funding Account
in an amount equal to the lesser of the following amounts:

                  (i) the amount of the deficiency in such targeted amount to
      be deposited into the Interest Funding Account; and

                  (ii) the Series 2004-B Nominal Liquidation Amount
      (determined after giving effect to the application of the Investor
      Charge-Off pursuant to Section 3.03);

            (b) second, if Series 2004-B is in its Accumulation Period or an
Early Redemption Period, (i) any remaining Series 2004-B Available Principal
Amount (after giving effect to clause (a)) will be applied to make the
targeted deposit to the Principal Funding Account pursuant to Section 3.07 and

effect to clause (i)) will be treated as Shared Excess Available Principal
Amount for application in accordance with Section 3.18;

Available Principal Amount for application in accordance with Section 3.18;
and

            (d) fourth, if the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2004-B has been reduced to zero on or before such Payment Date, the
remaining Series 2004-B Available Principal Amount (after giving effect to
clauses (a), (b) and (c)) shall be released to the Issuer for distribution in
respect of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

            SECTION 3.06. Computation of Reductions to the Nominal Liquidation
Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes and the Overcollateralization Amount from

            (a) Each reallocation of a portion of the Series 2004-B Available
Principal Amount that is deposited to the Interest Funding Account pursuant to
Section 3.05(a) will reduce the Overcollateralization Amount; provided,
however, that such reduction shall not exceed the Overcollateralization Amount
(after giving effect to any reductions pursuant to Section 3.03 for Investor
Charge-Offs).

            (b) Each reallocation of a portion of the Series 2004-B Available
Principal Amount that is deposited to the Interest Funding Account pursuant to
Section 3.05(a) in excess of the amounts applied pursuant to clause (a) above
that reduce the Overcollateralization Amount to zero will reduce the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes; provided, however, that the
amount of such reduction shall not exceed the Nominal Liquidation Amount of
the Series 2004-B Notes (after giving effect to any reductions pursuant to
Section 3.03 for Investor Charge-Offs).

            SECTION 3.07. Targeted Deposits of Series 2004-B Available

deposited, but in no case more than the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the
Series 2004-B Notes (computed immediately before giving effect to such deposit
but after giving effect to any reductions thereof due to any Investor
Charge-Offs and any reallocations of the Series 2004-B Available Principal
Amount on such date).

            (a) Budgeted Deposits. Subject to Section 3.07(b), with respect to
each Principal Payment Date, beginning with the Accumulation Commencement
Date, the targeted deposit to be made into the Principal Funding Account will
be the Controlled Deposit Amount for the related Payment Date.

            (b) Event of Default, Early Redemption Event, Other Optional or
Mandatory Redemption. If the Series 2004-B Notes have been accelerated during
a Monthly Period after the occurrence of an Event of Default, or if an Early

      desire to exercise the Put Feature in respect of their Series 2004-B
      Notes.

If the Put Feature is deemed to be exercised as provided in the preceding
sentence, it shall be deemed to be exercised by all Holders of the Series
2004-B Notes, whether or not they actually give notice of their desire to
exercise the Put Feature. Upon such deemed exercise of the Put Feature, the
Indenture Trustee shall cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the
related Non-Principal Receivables (or interests therein) in an amount up to
the Series 2004-B Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2004-B Notes. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture. The Holders of the Series 2004-B Notes
shall maintain their rights in their Series 2004-B Notes until such sale
proceeds have been applied in accordance with Section 706 of the Indenture and
shall present their Series 2004-B Notes to the Issuer in accordance with
Section 706 of the Indenture as part of their exercise of the Put Feature.

            (b) If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes
is greater than zero on the Legal Maturity Date (after giving effect to
deposits and distributions otherwise to be made on the Legal Maturity Date),
the Issuer will cause the Issuer to sell Principal Receivables and the related
Non-Principal Receivables on the Legal Maturity Date in an amount up to the
Series 2004-B Nominal Liquidation Amount plus any past due interest on the
Series 2004-B Notes; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that in no
event shall the amount of Principal Receivables so sold by the Issuer exceed
the Series 2004-B Nominal Liquidation Amount.

            (c) Sales proceeds received with respect to the Series 2004-B
Notes pursuant to clause (b) above will be allocated in the following
priority:

            (i) first, to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account, an
      amount up to the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
      Series 2004-B Notes immediately before giving effect to such deposit;
      and



                                      20
<PAGE>

            (ii) second, to be deposited in the Interest Funding Account, the
      balance of such sales proceeds.

            (d) Any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Funding
Account after a sale of Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.15 and the
final payment of the Series 2004-B Notes pursuant to Section 503 of the
Indenture, will be treated as part of the Series 2004-B Available Interest
Amount.

            SECTION 3.16. Calculation Agent; Determination of LIBOR.

            (a) The Issuer hereby agrees that for so long as any Series 2004-B
Notes are Outstanding, there shall at all times be an agent appointed to
calculate LIBOR for each Interest Period (the "Calculation Agent"). The Issuer
hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee as the Calculation Agent for
purposes of determining LIBOR for each Interest Period. The Calculation Agent
may be removed by the Issuer at any time. If the Calculation Agent is unable
or unwilling to act as such or is removed by the Issuer, or if the Calculation
Agent fails to determine LIBOR for an Interest Period, the Issuer shall
promptly appoint a replacement Calculation Agent that does not control or is
not controlled by or under common control with the Issuer or its Affiliates.
The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties, and the Issuer may not remove
the Calculation Agent, without a successor having been duly appointed and
having accepted such appointment.

            (b) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
determine LIBOR for the following Interest Period to equal the offered rate
for United States dollar deposits for one month that appears on Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such date. If that rate appears on
Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR will be that rate. If on any LIBOR Determination
Date the offered rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation
Agent will request each of the Reference Banks, to provide the Calculation
Agent with its offered quotation for United States dollar deposits for one
month to prime banks in the London interbank market as of 11:00 A.M., London
time, on the date. If at least two Reference Banks provide the Calculation
Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the arithmetic
mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
all the quotations. If on that date fewer than two Reference Banks provide the
Calculation Agent with the offered quotations, LIBOR on that date will be the
arithmetic mean, rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, of
the offered per annum rates that one or more leading banks in The City of New
York selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as of 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on that date to leading European banks for United States dollar
deposits for one month. If, however, those banks are not quoting as described
above, LIBOR for that date will be LIBOR applicable to the Interest Period
immediately preceding that Interest Period.

            (c) The Series 2004-B Note Interest Rate, applicable to the then
current and the immediately preceding Interest Periods, may be obtained by
telephoning the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office at (212)
328-7623 or such other telephone number as shall be designated by the
Indenture Trustee for such purpose by prior written notice by the Indenture
Trustee to each Series 2004-B Noteholder from time to time.



                                      21
<PAGE>

            (d) On each LIBOR Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall
send to the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and the Seller, by facsimile
transmission, notification of LIBOR for the following Interest Period.

            SECTION 3.17.  Excess Available Interest Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2004-B on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2004-B Available Interest Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2004-B with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2004-B Available Interest Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Interest Amount allocable to
Series 2004-B on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Interest Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Series 2004-B Available Interest Amount
Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Aggregate Series Available Interest Amount Shortfall for all series
of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Interest Amount that is not
required to be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of
Notes shall be released to the Issuer for distribution in respect of the
Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

           SECTION 3.18.  Excess Available Principal Amounts Sharing.

            (a) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2004-B on any Payment Date shall be treated as part of the Series
2004-B Available Principal Amount for such Payment Date.

            (b) The Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2004-B with respect to any Payment Date shall mean an amount equal to
the Series 2004-B Available Principal Amount Shortfall, if any, for such
Payment Date; provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes for such Payment Date is
less than the Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for such
Payment Date, then the Shared Excess Available Principal Amount allocable to
Series 2004-B on such Payment Date shall equal the product of (i) Shared
Excess Available Principal Amounts for all series of Notes and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Series 2004-B Available Principal
Amount Shortfall for such Payment Date and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of Aggregate Series Available Principal Amount Shortfall for
all series of Notes for such Payment Date.

            (c) Any Shared Excess Available Principal Amount not required to
be applied to make a payment or deposit in respect of a series of Notes shall
be applied as Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to Section 4.06 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

            SECTION 3.19.  Computation of Interest.

            (a) Interest on the Series 2004-B Notes shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the related
Interest Period.

            (b) Unless otherwise specified in this Indenture Supplement,
interest for any period will be calculated from and including the first day of
such period to and including the last day of such period.

            SECTION 3.20.  Variable Accumulation Period.

            The Issuer, acting directly or through the Administrator, may
elect, by written notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Beneficiary, to
delay, from time to time, the commencement of the Accumulation Period, and
extend the length of the Revolving Period, subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 3.20; provided, however, that the Accumulation Period shall
commence no later than the first day of the Monthly Period ending immediately
prior to the Series 2004-B Expected Final Payment Date. Any such election by
the Issuer shall be made not later than the first day of the last scheduled
Monthly Period of the Revolving Period (including any prior extension of the
Revolving Period pursuant to this Section 3.20). The Issuer may make such
election only if the following conditions are satisfied:

            (i) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee a
      certificate to the effect that the Issuer reasonably believes that the
      delay in the commencement of the Accumulation Period would not result in
      the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes not
      being paid in full on the Series 2004-B Expected Principal Payment Date;

            (ii) the Note Rating Agencies shall have advised the Issuer that
      such election to delay the commencement of the Accumulation Period would
      not cause the rating of any class of any series of Notes then
      outstanding to be lowered or withdrawn; and

            (iii) the amount to be deposited in the Principal Funding Account
      in respect of Controlled Accumulation Amount shall have been adjusted.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Indenture to the contrary, the
Administrator may, on behalf of the Issuer, (i) perform all such calculations
as are necessary to determine whether the Accumulation Period may be delayed
pursuant to this Section 3.20 and (ii) elect to delay the Accumulation Period
pursuant to this Section 3.20.

            SECTION 3.21. Payments to the Issuer. As an administrative
convenience for the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Seller all
amounts payable or to be released hereunder to the Issuer. The Issuer shall
give the Indenture Trustee written instructions as to who the Seller is and
where to make such payments.

            SECTION 3.22. Payment Instructions and Monthly Noteholders'
Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary,
the Issuer may amend the form of Payment Instruction for the Series 2004-B
Notes and the Series 2004-B Schedule to Monthly Noteholders' Statement from
time to time without the consent of the Indenture Trustee



                                      23
<PAGE>

or any Noteholder if it receives written confirmation from each Note Rating
Agency that such amendment will not cause a Ratings Effect.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                           EARLY REDEMPTION OF NOTES

            SECTION 4.01. Early Redemption Events. In addition to the events
identified as Early Redemption Events in Section 1201 of the Indenture, each
of the following events will also be an Early Redemption Event with respect to
the Series 2004-B Notes:

            (1) failure on the part of the Seller, the Servicer or DCS (if DCS
      is no longer the Servicer), as applicable, (i) to make any payment or
      deposit (including any Transfer Deposit Amount or Adjustment Payment)
      required by the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the
      Receivables Purchase Agreement on or before the date occurring two
      Business Days after the date such payment or deposit is required to be
      made therein, or (ii) to deliver a Monthly Noteholders' Statement or
      Payment Instruction within five Business Days of the day such item is
      due to be delivered under the Indenture, or (iii) duly to observe or
      perform in any material respect the covenant of the Seller set forth in
      Section 2.06(a) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement or (iv) duly to
      observe or perform in any material respect any other covenants or
      agreements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, set forth
      in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Receivables Purchase
      Agreement, which failure in the case of this subclause (iv) continues
      unremedied for a period of 45 days after the date on which written
      notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
      been given to the Seller by the Indenture Trustee;

            (2) any representation or warranty made by DCS in the Receivables
      Purchase Agreement or the Seller in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or
      any information contained in a computer file or microfiche or written
      list required to be delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section 2.01,
      2.05, 2.07 or 2.08 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, (i) shall prove
      to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or when
      delivered, and shall continue to be incorrect in any material respect
      for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of such
      failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
      Seller by the Indenture Trustee and (ii) as a result of such
      incorrectness the interests of the Series 2004-B Noteholders are
      materially and adversely affected; provided, however, that an Early
      Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2004-B Notes shall not be
      deemed to have occurred under this clause (2) if the Seller has
      repurchased the related Receivable or all such Receivables, if
      applicable, during such period in accordance with the provisions of the
      Sale and Servicing Agreement;

            (3) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
      Seller, DCS or DaimlerChrysler;



                                      24
<PAGE>

            (4) a failure by the Seller to convey Receivables in Additional
      Accounts to the Issuer within five Business Days after the day on which
      it is required to convey such Receivables pursuant to the Sale and
      Servicing Agreement;

            (5) on any Payment Date, the Primary Overcollateralization Amount
      for such Payment Date is reduced to an amount less than the Required
      Primary Overcollateralization Amount on that Payment Date after giving
      effect to the distributions to be made on such Payment Date; provided
      that, for the purpose of determining whether an Early Redemption Event
      has occurred pursuant to this clause (5), any reduction of the Primary
      Overcollateralization Amount resulting from reallocations of the Series
      2004-B Available Principal Amounts to pay interest on the Series 2004-B
      Notes in the event LIBOR is equal to or greater than the prime rate upon
      which interest on the Receivables is calculated on the applicable LIBOR
      Determination Date will be considered an Early Redemption Event only if
      LIBOR remains equal to or greater than such prime rate for the next 30
      consecutive days following such LIBOR Determination Date;

            (6) any Service Default occurs;

            (7) on any Determination Date, as of the last day of the preceding
      Collection Period, the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
      relating to Used Vehicles exceeds 20% of the Pool Balance on that last
      day;

            (8) on any Determination Date, the average of the Monthly Payment
      Rates for the three preceding Collection Periods is less than 20%;

            (9) the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-B
      Notes is not repaid by the Series 2004-B Expected Principal Payment
      Date;

            (10) the Seller or the Issuer becomes an investment company within
      the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and

            (11) the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the
      Series 2004-B Notes.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, in the case of
any event described in clause (1), (2) or (6) above, an Early Redemption Event
with respect to Series 2004-B will be deemed to have occurred only if, after
the applicable grace period described in such clause, if any, either the
Indenture Trustee or Series 2004-B Noteholders holding Series 2004-B Notes
evidencing more than 50% of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the
Series 2004-B Notes by written notice to the Seller, the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, if given by Series 2004-B Noteholders, declare that an
Early Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2004-B Notes has occurred as
of the date of that notice. In the case of any Early Redemption Event
described in clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (11) above, an Early
Redemption Event with respect to the Series 2004-B Notes shall be deemed to
have occurred without any notice or other action on the part of the Indenture
Trustee or the Series 2004-B Noteholders immediately upon the occurrence of
such event.



                                      25
<PAGE>

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if (x) an
Early Redemption Period results from the failure by DCWR to convey Receivables
in Additional Accounts to the Issuer, as described in clause (4) above during
the Revolving Period, (y) no other Early Redemption Event that has not been
cured or waived in accordance with the Indenture has occurred and (z) each
Note Rating Agency has confirmed that recommencing the Revolving Period will
not cause a Ratings Effect, then the Early Redemption Period resulting from
such failure will terminate and the Revolving Period will recommence as of the
end of the first Collection Period during which the Seller would no longer be
required to convey Receivables in Additional Accounts to the Issuer; provided
that the Revolving Period will not recommence if the scheduled termination
date of the Revolving Period has occurred.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.01, if an Early
Redemption Event (other than an Early Redemption Event specified in clause (3)
or (10) above) has occurred and the scheduled termination of the Revolving
Period has not occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall request from Standard &
Poor's a confirmation that such Early Redemption Event will not cause a
Ratings Effect. If the Indenture Trustee receives such confirmation and the
Majority Holders of Series 2004-B Notes consent to the recommencement of the
Revolving Period, the related Early Redemption Period shall terminate and the
Revolving Period shall recommence.

                           ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS

            SECTION 5.01.  Accounts.

            (a) Accounts; Deposits to and Distributions from Accounts. On or
before the Issuance Date, the Indenture Trustee will cause to be established
and maintained two Qualified Accounts denominated as follows: the "Interest
Funding Account" and the "Principal Funding Account" (collectively, the
"Series 2004-B Accounts") in the name of the Indenture Trustee, bearing a
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for
the benefit of the Series 2004-B Noteholders. The Series 2004-B Accounts
constitute Supplemental Accounts and shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2004-B
Noteholders. If, at any time, the institution holding any Series 2004-B
Account ceases to be a Qualified Institution, the Issuer will within ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
as to which each Note Rating Agency may consent) establish a new applicable
Series 2004-B Account, that is a Qualified Account and shall transfer any cash
and/or investments to such new Series 2004-B Account. From the date such new
Series 2004-B Account is established, it will be a Series 2004-B Account,
bearing the name of the Series 2004-B Account it has replaced.

            (b) All payments to be made from time to time by the Indenture
Trustee to Series 2004-B Noteholders out of funds in the Series 2004-B
Accounts pursuant to this Indenture Supplement will be made by the Indenture
Trustee to the Paying Agent not later than 12:00 noon on the applicable
Interest Payment Date or Principal Payment Date but only to the extent of
funds in the applicable Series 2004-B Account or as otherwise provided in
Article III.

year and the actual number of days elapsed. Such principal of and interest on
this Note shall be paid in the manner specified on the reverse hereof.

            The principal of and interest on this Note are payable in such
coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts. All payments made by the
Issuer with respect to this Note shall be applied first to interest due and
payable on this Note as provided above and then to the unpaid principal of
this Note.

            Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth
on the reverse hereof, which shall have the same effect as though fully set
forth on the face of this Note.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Indenture Trustee whose name appears below by manual signature, this
Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture referred to on
the reverse hereof, or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

                               [REVERSE OF NOTE]

            This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the
Issuer, designated as its Floating Rate Auto Dealer Loan Asset Backed Notes,
Series 2004-B (the "Notes" or "Series 2004-B Notes"), all issued under an
Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended,
restated and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), as supplemented
by an Amended and Restated Series 2004-B Indenture Supplement, dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time,
the "Indenture Supplement"), each between the Issuer and The Bank of New York,
as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee," which term includes any
successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Notes are subject to all terms of
the Indenture and the Indenture Supplement. All terms used in this Note that
are defined in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement, each as supplemented
or amended, shall have the meanings assigned to them in or pursuant to the
Indenture or the Indenture Supplement.

            The Notes are and will be equally and ratably secured by the
collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.

            Principal of the Notes will be payable on the Expected Principal
Payment Date in an amount described on the face hereof. Upon the occurrence of
certain events specified in the Indenture or the Indenture Supplement,
payments of principal of the Notes may be made prior to or after the Expected
Principal Payment Date.

            As described above, the entire unpaid principal amount of this
Note shall be due and payable on the Legal Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes may be due and
payable following an Event of Default in the manner provided in Section 702 of
the Indenture; provided, however, that such acceleration of the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes may be rescinded by the holders of not less than
a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes. All
principal payments on the Notes shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders
entitled thereto.

            On any day occurring on or after the date on which the aggregate
Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes is reduced to less than
10% of the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Series 2004-B Notes, the
Servicer has the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Issuer to redeem
the Series 2004-B Notes in whole but not in part, pursuant to Section 1202 of
the Indenture equal the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Series
2004-B Notes, plus interest accrued and unpaid to but excluding the date of
redemption.

            Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the
Beneficiary may, from time to time, direct the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the
Issuer, to issue one or more series or classes of notes.

            On each Payment Date, the Paying Agent shall distribute to each
Series 2004-B Noteholder of record on the related Record Date (except for the
final distribution with respect to this Note) such Series 2004-B Noteholder's
pro rata share of the amounts held by the Paying

Agent that are allocated and available on such Payment Date to pay interest
and principal on the Series 2004-B Notes. Final payments of this Note will be
made only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the office or
offices therein specified.

            Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Payment
Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in
full payment of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to the Person whose
name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor
Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date,
except that with respect to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of
the nominee of the clearing agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.),
payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account designated by such nominee. Such checks shall be mailed to the Person
entitled thereto at the address of such Person as it appears on the Note
Register as of the applicable Record Date without requiring that this Note be
submitted for notation of payment. Any reduction in the principal amount of
this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made
on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and
of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon. If funds are expected
to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then
remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a Payment Date, then the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the
Person who was the Registered Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding
such Payment Date by notice mailed within five days of such Payment Date and
the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee's principal Corporate Trust
Office or at the office of the Indenture Trustee's agent appointed for such
purposes located in the City of New York.

            As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note
Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company located, or having a correspondent located,
in the City of New York or the city in which the Corporate Trust Office is
located, or a member firm of a national securities exchange, and such other
documents as the Indenture Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new
Notes of authorized denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge
will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but
the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer or exchange.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and agrees
that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the
obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the
Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in
connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the
Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner,



                                     A-5
<PAGE>

beneficiary, agent, officer, director or employee of the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any
successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed and
except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to
the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock,
unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to
such entity.

            Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
that by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that it will not at any time
institute against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or the Issuer, or
join in any institution against DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC or
the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States Federal
or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating
to the Notes, the Indenture or any Derivative Agreement.

            Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this
Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note (as of the day
of determination or as of such other date as may be specified in the
Indenture) is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the
Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Holders of Notes
representing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of all Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of Notes representing specified percentages
of the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or
any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The
Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms
and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the consent of Holders of
the Notes issued thereunder.

            The term "Issuer" as used in this Note includes any successor to
the Issuer under the Indenture.

            The Issuer is permitted by the Indenture, under certain
circumstances, to merge or consolidate, subject to the rights of the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of Notes under the Indenture.

being understood that the Owner Trustee has no such obligations in its
individual capacity). The Holder of this Note by the acceptance hereof agrees

Supplement in the case of an Event of Default under the Indenture, the Holder

<PAGE>


Security with respect thereto owned by the Seller at the close of business on
such Transfer Date and not theretofore conveyed to the Trust, all monies due
or to become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all

conveyances do not constitute, and are not intended to result in, the creation
or an assumption by the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee, any Agent, any
Noteholder or any Enhancement Provider of any obligation of the Servicer, DCS,
the Seller, DaimlerChrysler or any other Person in connection with the
Accounts, the Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating

"accounts" or "payment intangibles" (each as defined in Section 9-102 of the

applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect the sale and assignment of the Receivables and the Collateral
Security to the Trust, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing
statements or other evidence of such filing to the Trustee on or prior to the
Effective Date, in the case of the Existing Accounts, and (if any additional

file such financing statement, or a continuation statement to such financing
statement, or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection with such
sales.

          (e) In connection with such sales, the Seller further agrees, at its
own expense, on or prior to the Effective Date, in the case of the Existing
Accounts, the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Additional Accounts,
and the applicable Removal Commencement Date, in the case of Removed Accounts,
(x) to indicate in its computer files and to cause DCS to indicate in its
computer files as required by the Receivables Purchase Agreement, that the
Receivables created in connection with the Accounts (other than Removed
Accounts) have been sold, and the Collateral Security assigned, to the Seller
in accordance with the Receivables Purchase Agreement, and sold to the Trust
pursuant to this Agreement, and pledged by the Trust to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the
Indenture and (y) to deliver to the Trust and the Trustee (or cause DCS to do
so) a computer file or microfiche or written list containing a true and
complete list of all such Accounts (other than Removed Accounts) specifying
for each such Account, as of the Initial Cut-Off Date, in the case of the
Existing Accounts, and the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, in the case of
Additional Accounts, (i) its account number, (ii) the aggregate amount of

          (f) The parties hereto intend that the transfers of Purchased Assets
effected by this Agreement be sales. Nevertheless, if such transfers are
deemed to be transfers for security, then this Agreement also shall be deemed
to be and hereby is a security agreement within the meaning of the UCC, and
the conveyance by the Seller provided for in this Agreement shall also be
deemed to be and hereby is a grant by the Seller to the Trust of a security
interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest, whether now owned
or hereafter acquired, in, to and under such Purchased Assets. For tax
purposes, the parties hereto intend that all transfers of Purchased Assets
under this Agreement constitute transfers of such Purchased Assets as security
for a loan.

simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Seller
delivered to the Trust and the Trustee the computer file or microfiche or
written list relating to the Existing Accounts described in Section 2.01(e).

by the CARCO Trust Trustee on behalf of the Seller as provided in the Program
Amendment Agreement) to the Trust on the Effective Date pursuant to Section
2.01(a), the Trust (i) shall cause the Indenture Trustee to deliver, on behalf
of the Trust and the Seller, on the Effective Date the Collateral Certificate
to the CARCO Trust Trustee for cancellation by the CARCO Trust Trustee and
(ii) shall execute, and cause the Owner Trustee to authenticate and deliver to
the order of the Seller on the Effective Date, the DCMOT Certificate pursuant
to the Trust Agreement; it being understood that concurrently with such
issuance and delivery of the DCMOT Certificate to the Seller, the Seller shall
have delivered the CARCO Certificate to the CARCO Trust Trustee for
cancellation by the CARCO Trust Trustee.

          (c) In consideration for the property transferred by the Seller to
the Trust on each Addition Date pursuant to Section 2.01(a) and on each
Transfer Date (other than the Effective Date) pursuant to Section 2.01(b), the
Trust shall cause to be paid to the Seller all such funds available to be paid
to the Seller in respect of the Seller's Interest, to the extent specifically
permitted under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements;
it being understood that any excess of the aggregate principal balance of the
Receivables transferred on an Addition Date or a Transfer Date (other than the
Effective Date) over the funds available to be paid to the Seller on such date
shall result, to the extent provided in this Agreement, the Indenture and the
Indenture Supplements, in an increase of the Seller's Interest evidenced by
the Seller's Certificates issued pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

period as may be specified), the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 2.03 shall be satisfied in all material respects, and any
material adverse effect on the Noteholders' Interest caused thereby shall have
been cured. The Seller shall deposit in the Collection Account in immediately
available funds on the Business Day preceding such Payment Date, in payment
for such purchase of the Noteholders' Interest, the Reassignment Amount for
such Payment Date.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such
amounts deposited in the Collection Account shall be applied in accordance
with Section 706 of the Indenture and shall be allocated pro rata among the
then-outstanding Series based on their respective Series Nominal Liquidation
Amounts. If the Trustee or the Noteholders give notice directing the Seller to
purchase the Noteholders' Interest as provided above, the obligation of the
Seller to purchase the Noteholders' Interest pursuant to this Section 2.03
shall constitute the sole remedy respecting an event of the type specified in
the first sentence of this Section 2.03 available to the Noteholders (or the
Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders).

     SECTION 2.04 Representations and Warranties of the Seller Relating to the
Receivables.

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Trust that:

              (i) Each Receivable and all Collateral Security existing on the
     Effective Date or, in the case of Additional Accounts, on the applicable
     Addition Date, and on each Transfer Date, has been conveyed to the Trust
     free and clear of any Lien, subject to the rights of the Purchased
     Receivables Owners in any Collateral Security in respect of the Partial
     Accounts (other than the Vehicles relating to Principal Receivables
     arising in the Partial Accounts) and except for Liens permitted under the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement.

              (ii) With respect to each Receivable and all Collateral Security
     existing on the Effective Date or, in the case of Additional Accounts, on
     the applicable Addition Date, and on each Transfer Date, all consents,
     licenses, approvals or authorizations of or registrations or declarations
     with any Governmental Authority required to be obtained, effected or
     given by the Seller in connection with the conveyance of such Receivable
     or Collateral Security to the Trust have been duly obtained, effected or
     given and are in full force and effect.


                                      25


<PAGE>


              (iii) On the Initial Cut-Off Date, the Effective Date and each
     subsequent Closing Date, each Existing Account is an Eligible Account
     and, in the case of Additional Accounts, on the applicable Additional
     Cut-Off Date and each subsequent Closing Date, each such Additional
     Account is an Eligible Account.

              (iv) On the Effective Date, in the case of the Existing Accounts,
     and, in the case of the Additional Accounts, on the applicable Additional
     Cut-Off Date, and on each Transfer Date, each Receivable conveyed to the
     Trust on such date is an Eligible Receivable or, if such Receivable is
     not an Eligible Receivable, such Receivable is conveyed to the Trust in
     accordance with Section 2.09.

          (b) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 2.04 shall survive the transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Trust and the issuance of the Notes. Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Servicer, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Agent or the Trustee
of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 2.04, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written
notice to the other parties specified above, and to any Enhancement Providers.

          (c) Reassignment. In the event any representation or warranty under
Section 2.04(a) is not true and correct as of the date specified therein with
respect to any Receivable or Account and such breach has a material adverse
effect on the Noteholders' Interest in any such Receivable or Account, then,
within 30 days (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee) of
the earlier to occur of the discovery of any such event by the Seller or the
Servicer, or receipt by the Seller or the Servicer of written notice of any
such event given by the Trustee, any Agent or any Enhancement Providers, the
Seller shall accept a reassignment of such Receivable or, in the case of such
an untrue representation or warranty with respect to an Account, all
Receivables in such Account, on the Determination Date immediately succeeding
the day of such discovery or notice on the terms and conditions set forth in
the next succeeding paragraph; provided, however, that no such reassignment
shall be required to be made with respect to such Receivable if, by the end of
such 30-day period (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee),
the breached representation or warranty shall then be true and correct in all
material respects and any material adverse effect caused thereby shall have
been cured.

          The Seller shall accept a reassignment of each such Receivable by
directing the Servicer to deduct, subject to the next sentence, the principal
amount of such Receivables from the Pool Balance on or prior to the end of the
Collection Period in which such reassignment obligation arises. If, following
such deduction, the Pool Balance would be less than the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount on the immediately preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
deposits to be made on the Payment Date following such Determination Date),
then not later than 12:00 noon on the day on which such reassignment occurs,
the Seller shall deposit in the Collection Account in immediately available
funds the amount (the "Transfer Deposit Amount") by which the Pool Balance
would be less than the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount (up to the
principal amount of such Receivables); provided that if the Transfer Deposit
Amount is not deposited as required by this sentence, then the principal
amounts of such Receivables shall only be deducted from the Pool Balance to
the extent that the Pool Balance is not reduced below the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount, and the Receivables the principal amounts of


                                      26


<PAGE>


which have not been so deducted shall not be reassigned to the Seller and
shall remain part of the Trust. Upon reassignment of any such Receivable, but
only after payment by the Seller of the Transfer Deposit Amount, if any, the
Trust shall automatically and without further action be deemed to sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without
recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the
Trust in and to such Receivable, all Collateral Security and all moneys due or
to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof. The Trustee shall
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall reasonably be requested by the Seller to effect the
conveyance of such Receivables pursuant to this Section. The obligation of the
Seller to accept a reassignment of any such Receivable and to pay any related
Transfer Deposit Amount shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event
giving rise to such obligation available to the Trust, the Noteholders (or the
Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders).

     SECTION 2.05 Addition of Accounts.

          (a) If, as of the close of business on the last day of any
Collection Period, (i) the Pool Balance on such day is less than the Required
Participation Amount as of the following Payment Date (after giving effect to
the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on such
Payment Date), or (ii) the result obtained by multiplying (x) the Seller's
Participation Amount as of the following Payment Date (after giving effect to
the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on such
Payment Date), by (y) the percentage equivalent of the portion of the Seller's
Interest represented by the DCMOT Certificate, is less than 2% of the Pool
Balance on such last day, then the Seller shall, within ten Business Days
following the end of such Collection Period, designate and transfer to the
Trust the Receivables (and the related Collateral Security) of additional
Eligible Accounts of the Seller to be included as Accounts in a sufficient
amount such that after giving effect to such addition (i) the Pool Balance as
of the close of business on the Addition Date is at least equal to such
Required Participation Amount or (ii) the result obtained by multiplying (x)
such Seller's Participation Amount by (y) the percentage equivalent of the
portion of the Seller's Interest represented by the DCMOT Certificate, is at
least equal to 2% of such Pool Balance, as the case may be. The Seller shall
satisfy the conditions specified in Section 2.05(d) in designating such
Additional Accounts and conveying the related Receivables to the Trust. The
failure of the Seller to transfer Receivables to the Trust as provided in this
paragraph solely as a result of the unavailability of a sufficient amount of
Eligible Receivables shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement;
provided, however, that any such failure will nevertheless result in the
occurrence of an Early Redemption Event described in each Indenture
Supplement, unless otherwise specified therein with respect to the related
Series or Class.

          (b) The Seller may from time to time, at its sole discretion,
subject to the conditions specified in paragraph (d) below, voluntarily
designate additional Eligible Accounts (including Partial Accounts) to be
included as Accounts and transfer to the Trust the Receivables (and the
related Collateral Security) of such Additional Accounts.

          (c) Receivables and Collateral Security from such Additional
Accounts shall be sold to the Trust effective on a date (the "Addition Date")
specified in a written notice provided by the Seller (or the Servicer on its
behalf) to the Trust, the Trustee, the Rating Agencies, any Agent and any
Enhancement Providers specifying the Additional Cut-Off Date


                                      27


<PAGE>


and the Addition Date for such Additional Accounts (the "Addition Notice") on
or before the fifth Business Day but not more than the 30th day prior to the
related Addition Date (the "Notice Date"). The Addition Notice shall also
specify whether any such Additional Accounts are Partial Accounts.

          (d) The Seller shall be permitted to convey to the Trust the
Receivables and all Collateral Security related thereto in any Additional
Accounts designated by the Seller as such pursuant to Section 2.05(a) or (b)
only upon satisfaction of each of the following conditions on or prior to the
related Addition Date:

               (i) the Seller shall have provided the Trust, the Trustee, any
     Agent, the Rating Agencies and any Enhancement Providers with a timely
     Addition Notice;

               (ii) such Additional Accounts shall all be Eligible Accounts;

               (iii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust and the
     Trustee a duly executed written assignment (which shall be acknowledged
     and accepted by the Trustee) in substantially the form of Exhibit B (the
     "Assignment") and the computer file or microfiche or written list
     required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.01;

               (iv) the Seller shall, to the extent required by Section 4.03,
     have deposited in the Collection Account all Collections with respect to
     such Additional Accounts since the Additional Cut-Off Date;

               (v) (A) no selection procedures believed by the Seller to be
     adverse to the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or any Enhancement
     Providers were used in selecting such Additional Accounts; (B) the list
     of Additional Accounts delivered pursuant to clause (iii) above is true
     and correct in all material respects as of the Additional Cut-Off Date
     and (C) as of each of the Notice Date and the Addition Date, the Seller
     was neither insolvent nor will be made insolvent by such transfer, and
     the Seller is not aware of any pending insolvency;

               (vi) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with
     respect to such addition;

               (vii) the addition of the Receivables arising in such Additional
     Accounts shall not result in the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event;

               (viii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the
     Trustee and any Enhancement Providers a certificate of a Vice President
     or more senior officer confirming (A) the items set forth in paragraphs
     (ii) through (vii) above and (B) that the Seller reasonably believes that
     the addition of the Receivables arising in such Additional Accounts will
     not result in the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event; and

               (ix) on or before each Addition Date, the Seller shall have
     delivered to the Trust, the Trustee and any Enhancement Providers (A) an
     Opinion of Counsel with respect to the Receivables in the Additional
     Accounts substantially in the form of Exhibit


                                      28


<PAGE>


     G-2 and (B) except in the case of an addition required by Section
     2.05(a), a Tax Opinion with respect to such addition.


          (e) The Seller hereby represents and warrants as of the applicable
Addition Date as to the matters set forth in Section 2.05(d)(v). Upon
discovery by the Seller, the Servicer, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Agent
or the Trustee of a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties,
the party discovering the breach shall give prompt written notice to the other
parties specified above, and to any Enhancement Providers.

          (f) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Rating Agencies,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller may
from time to time, at its discretion, and subject only to the limitations
specified in this paragraph, designate Additional Accounts to be added to the
Trust. (Additional Accounts designated to be added to the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 2.05(f) are referred to herein as
"Automatic Additional Accounts".) On the Addition Date with respect to any
Automatic Additional Accounts, the Trust shall purchase the Receivables in
such Automatic Additional Accounts (and such Automatic Additional Accounts
shall be deemed to be Accounts for purposes of this Agreement) as of the close
of business on the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (i) such Automatic Additional Accounts shall be Eligible
     Accounts;

               (ii) the Seller shall, to the extent required by Section 4.03,
     have deposited in the Collection Account all Collections with respect to
     such Automatic Additional Accounts since the Additional Cut-Off Date;

               (iii) no selection procedures believed by the Seller to be
     adverse to the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or any Enhancement
     Providers were used in selecting such Automatic Additional Accounts;

               (iv) as of each of the Additional Cut-Off Date and the Addition
     Date, no Insolvency Event with respect to DCS or the Seller shall have
     occurred nor shall the transfer of the Receivables arising in the
     Automatic Additional Accounts to the Trust have been made in
     contemplation of the occurrence thereof;

               (v) the addition of the Receivables arising in the Automatic
     Additional Accounts shall not cause an Early Redemption Event or any
     event that, after the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would
     constitute an Early Redemption Event to occur with respect to any Series;

               (vi) on or before each Addition Date with respect to Automatic
     Additional Accounts, the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the
     Trustee and the Rating Agencies (A) an Opinion of Counsel with respect to
     the Receivables in the Automatic Additional Accounts substantially in the
     form of Exhibit G-2 to this Agreement and (B) a Tax Opinion with respect
     to such addition;

               (vii) within ten Business Days of the date on which any such
     Receivables are added to the Trust, the Seller shall have delivered to
     the Trust and the


                                      29


<PAGE>


     Trustee a written assignment and a computer file or a microfiche list
     containing a true and complete list of the related Automatic Additional
     Accounts specifying for each such Account its account number, the
     collection status, the aggregate amount outstanding in such Account and
     the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables outstanding in such
     Account; and

               (viii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust and the
     Trustee an Officers' Certificate of the Seller, dated the Addition Date,
     to the effect that conditions (i) through (v) and (vii) above have been
     satisfied.

          The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Trust as of the
related Addition Date as to the matters relating to it set forth in paragraphs
(iii) and (iv) above and that the file or list described below is, as of the
applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, true and complete in all material
respects.

          In connection with the designation of Automatic Additional Accounts
to be added to the Trust, the Seller shall deliver to the Trust and the
Trustee (i) the computer file or microfiche list required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such Automatic Additional Accounts
and (ii) a duly executed written Assignment (which shall be acknowledged and
accepted by the Trustee), substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this
Agreement.

          Unless each Rating Agency otherwise consents, the number of
Automatic Additional Accounts added to the Trust with respect to any of the
three consecutive Collection Periods beginning in January, April, July and
October of each calendar year shall not exceed 8% of the number of Accounts as
of the first day of the calendar year during which such Collection Periods
commence and the number of Automatic Additional Accounts designated during any
such calendar year shall not exceed 20% of the number of Accounts as of the
first day of such calendar year. On or before the first business day of each
Collection Period beginning in January, April, July and October of each
calendar year, the Seller shall have requested and obtained notification from
each Rating Agency of any limitations to the right of the Seller to designate
Eligible Accounts as Automatic Additional Accounts during any period which
includes such Collection Period. To the extent that Automatic Additional
Accounts have been added to the Trust during the three consecutive Collection
Periods ending in the calendar month prior to such date, on or before January
31, April 30, July 31, October 31 of each calendar year, the Trustee shall
have received confirmation from each Rating Agency that the addition of all
Automatic Additional Accounts included as Accounts during the three
consecutive Collection Periods ending in the calendar month prior to such date
shall not have resulted in any applicable Rating Agency reducing or
withdrawing its rating of any outstanding Series or Class of Notes. If such
Rating Agency confirmation with respect to any Automatic Additional Accounts
is not so received, such Automatic Additional Accounts will be removed from
the Trust.

     SECTION 2.06 Covenants of the Seller.

          The Seller hereby covenants that:

          (a) No Liens. Except for the conveyances hereunder, or as provided
in Section 10.10 of the Trust Agreement with respect to Supplemental
Certificates, the Seller will


                                      30


<PAGE>


not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant, create,
incur, assume or (subject to the rights of the Purchased Receivables Owners
with respect to the Collateral Security arising in the Partial Accounts (other
than the Vehicles relating to any Principal Receivables) and except as
permitted under the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents) suffer to exist any Lien on, any Receivable or any Collateral
Security, whether now existing or hereafter created, or any interest therein,
or the Seller's rights, remedies, powers or privileges with respect to the
Receivables under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, or the Seller's Interest
or the Seller's Certificates and the Seller shall defend the right, title and
interest of the Trust in, to and under the Receivables and the Collateral
Security, whether now existing or hereafter created, and such rights,
remedies, powers and privileges, against all claims of third parties claiming
through or under the Seller.

          (b) Account Allocations. In the event that the Seller is unable for
any reason to transfer Receivables to the Trust, then the Seller agrees that
it shall allocate, after the occurrence of such event, payments on each
Account with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the
oldest principal balance of such Account and to have such payments applied as
Collections in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that, in the case of Partial Accounts, Collections of Principal Receivables
shall be allocated to the Principal Receivables to which such Collections
relate. The parties hereto agree that Non-Principal Receivables, whenever
created, accrued in respect of Principal Receivables which have been conveyed
to the Trust shall continue to be a part of the Trust notwithstanding any
cessation of the transfer of additional Principal Receivables to the Trust and
Collections with respect thereto shall continue to be allocated and paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (c) Delivery of Collections. In the event that the Seller, DCS or
any Affiliate thereof receives payments in respect of Receivables, the Seller
and DCS agree to pay or cause to be paid to the Servicer or any Successor
Servicer all payments received thereby in respect of the Receivables as soon
as practicable after receipt thereof, but in no event later than two Business
Days after the receipt by the Seller, DCS or any Affiliate thereof.

          (d) Notice of Liens. The Seller shall notify the Trust and the
Trustee promptly after becoming aware of any Lien on any Receivable other than
the conveyances hereunder.

          (e) Compliance with Law. The Seller hereby agrees to comply in all
material respects with all Requirements of Law applicable to the Seller.

          (f) Activities of the Seller. The Seller will not engage in any
business or activity of any kind or enter into any transaction other than (x)
the businesses, activities and transactions contemplated and authorized by
this Agreement or the Related Documents or (y) the business of acquiring,
selling or financing wholesale and retail receivables and related activities
and transactions (such businesses, activities and transactions, collectively,
"Permitted Transactions").

          (g) Indebtedness. The Seller will not create, incur or assume any
indebtedness or issue any securities or sell or transfer any receivables to a
trust or other Person


                                      31


<PAGE>


which issues securities in respect of any such receivables, unless (i) any
such indebtedness or securities have no recourse to any assets of the Seller
other than the specified assets to which such indebtedness or securities
relate and (ii) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied in
connection therewith prior to the incurrence or issuance thereof.

          (h) Guarantees. The Seller will not become or remain liable,
directly or contingently, in connection with any indebtedness or other
liability of any other Person, whether by guarantee, endorsement (other than
endorsements of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection in the
ordinary course of business), agreement to purchase or purchase, agreement to
supply or advance funds, or otherwise, except in connection with Permitted
Transactions and unless the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied
with respect thereto.

          (i) Investments. The Seller will not make or suffer to exist any
loans or advances to, or extend any credit to, or make any investments (by way
of transfer of property, contributions to capital purchase of stock or
securities or evidences of indebtedness, acquisition of the business or
assets, or otherwise) in, any Affiliate, unless prior thereto the Rating
Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect thereto; provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be prohibited under this Section 2.06(i)
from declaring or paying any dividends in respect of its common stock.

          (j) Stock; Merger. The Seller will not (i) sell any shares of any
class of its capital stock or membership interests, as applicable, to any
Person (other than DCS and its Affiliates), or enter into any transaction of
merger or consolidation unless (A) the surviving Person of such merger or
consolidation assumes all of the Seller's obligations under this Agreement,
(B) the Seller shall have given the Rating Agencies at least 10 days' prior
notice and the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect
to such transaction and (C) such merger or consolidation does not conflict
with any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or other governing
document of the Seller, or (ii) terminate, liquidate or dissolve itself (or
suffer any termination, liquidation or dissolution), or (iii) acquire or be
acquired by any Person, or (iv) otherwise make (or suffer) any material change
in the organization of or method of conducting its business.

          (k) Agreements. The Seller will not become a party to, or permit any
of its properties to be bound by, any indenture, mortgage, instrument,
contract, agreement, lease or other undertaking, except this Agreement, the
Related Documents and any document relating to a Permitted Transaction, or
amend or modify its certificate of incorporation or other governing document
or cancel, terminate, amend, supplement, modify or waive any of the provisions
of the Receivables Purchase Agreement or any of the other Related Documents or
request, consent or agree to or suffer to exist or permit any such
cancellation, termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
unless, in any such case, the Rating Agency Condition shall have been
satisfied with respect thereto.

     SECTION 2.07 Removal of Eligible Accounts.

          (a) On each Determination Date the Seller shall have the right to
remove Accounts from the Trust in the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(b). In
addition, on each Determination Date the Seller shall have the right to remove
Accounts from the Trust and, in


                                      32


<PAGE>


connection therewith, repurchase the then-existing Receivables in such
Accounts, in the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(c). In addition, on each
Determination Date the Seller shall have the right to remove DTS Accounts in
the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(f). None of the Receivables that have
been removed from the Trust shall be sold or otherwise transferred to DCS, and
DCS agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, it will not purchase or otherwise acquire such
Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not remove Accounts
from the Trust more often than once a month.

          (b) To remove Accounts, the Seller (or the Servicer on its behalf)
shall take the following actions and make the following determinations:

               (i) not less than five Business Days prior to the Removal
     Commencement Date, furnish to the Trust, the Trustee, any Agent, any
     Enhancement Providers and the Rating Agencies a written notice (the
     "Removal Notice") specifying the Determination Date (which may be the
     Determination Date on which such notice is given) on which removal of the
     Receivables of one or more Accounts will commence (a "Removal
     Commencement Date") and the Accounts the future generated Receivables of
     which are to be removed from the Trust (the "Designated Accounts");

               (ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with respect to
     such Designated Accounts the aggregate balance of Principal Receivables
     in respect of each such Designated Account (the "Designated Balance") and
     amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Trust and the Trustee a computer
     file or microfiche or written list containing a true and complete list of
     the Removed Accounts specifying for each such Account, as of the Removal
     Commencement Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of
     Receivables outstanding in such Account and the Designated Balance;

               (iii) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, cease to
     transfer to the Trust any and all Receivables arising in such Designated
     Accounts;

               (iv) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, allocate all
     Collections of Principal Receivables in respect of each such Designated
     Account, first to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     Designated Account, until the Determination Date on which the Designated
     Balance with respect to such Designated Account is reduced to zero (the
     "Removal Date");

               (v) on each Business Day from and after such Removal
     Commencement Date to and until the related Removal Date, allocate (A) to
     the Trust (to be further allocated pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement), Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal
     Receivables in respect of each Designated Account, based on the ratio of
     the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in all Designated Accounts
     sold to the Trust on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of
     Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such Business
     Day and (B) to the Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and
     Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts
     on such Business Day;


                                      33


<PAGE>


               (vi) represent and warrant that the removal of any such Eligible
     Account on any Removal Date shall not, in the reasonable belief of the

     Accounts;

               (viii) represent and warrant as of the Removal Date that the
     list of Removed Accounts delivered pursuant to clause (ii) above, as of

respect to any such Designated Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with Section 2.07(b) and such Designated

its behalf) shall take the following actions and make the following
determinations:

               (i) determine on the Business Day on which each such Dealer is

     and the Trustee a computer file or microfiche or written list containing
     for each such DTS Account, as of the DTS Removal Commencement Date for
     such Account, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables

     DTS Account, first, to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     DTS Account, until the Determination Date on which the DTS Balance with
     respect to such Designated Account is reduced to zero (the "DTS Removal
     Date");


                                      36


<PAGE>


               (iv) on each Business Day from and after such DTS Removal
     Commencement Date to and until the related DTS Removal Date, allocate (A)
     to the Trust (to be further allocated pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement), Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal
     Receivables in respect of each DTS Account, based on the ratio of the
     aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in all DTS Accounts sold to the
     Trust on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of Principal
     Receivables in all such DTS Accounts on such Business Day and (B) to the
     Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and Collections of
     Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such
     Business Day;

               (v) represent and warrant as of the DTS Removal Date that the
     DTS Accounts specified in clause (i) above and the DTS Designated
     Balances of such DTS Accounts, as of the DTS Removal Commencement Date,
     is true and complete in all material respects;

               (vi) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the Trustee,

          In the case of any removal of a DTS Account, on the DTS Removal Date
with respect to any such DTS Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with this Section 2.07(f) and such DTS
Account shall be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes (also a
"Removed Account"). Within five Business Days after the DTS Removal Date, the
Trust and the Trustee shall execute and deliver (but shall have no duty to
prepare) to the Seller a Reassignment, together with appropriate UCC financing
statements.

          (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Seller shall have the right to require the reassignment to it of all the
Trust's right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables
then-existing and thereafter created, all monies due or to become due and all
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof in or with
respect to the Accounts ("Automatic Removed Accounts") designated by the
Seller, upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (i) on or before the fifth Business Day immediately preceding
     the date upon which such Accounts are to be removed, the Seller shall
     have given the Trust, the Trustee, each Enhancement Provider and the
     Rating Agencies a Removal Notice specifying the date for removal of the
     Automatic Removed Accounts (the "Automatic Removal Date");

               (ii) on or prior to the date that is five Business Days after
     the Automatic Removal Date, the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust
     and the Trustee a


                                      37


<PAGE>

     complete list of the Automatic Removed Accounts specifying for each such
     Account, as of the removal notice date, its account number and the
     aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account;

               (iii) the Seller shall have represented and warranted as of each
     Automatic Removal Date that the list of Automatic Removed Accounts
     delivered pursuant to clause (ii) above, as of the Automatic Removal
     Date, is true and complete in all material respects and that the
     selection procedures for selecting the Automatic Removed Accounts were
     applied so as to randomly select the Automatic Removed Accounts from the
     entire population of Accounts;

               (iv) the Trustee shall have received confirmation from each
     Rating Agency that such removal will not result in a reduction or
     withdrawal of such Rating Agency's rating of any outstanding Series or
     Class of Certificates;

               (v) the Seller shall have delivered to the Trust, the Trustee,
     each Rating Agency and any Enhancement Providers an Officers'
     Certificate, dated the Automatic Removal Date, to the effect that the
     Seller reasonably believes that such removal will not cause an Early
     Redemption Event to occur with respect to any Series or cause the Pool
     Balance to be less than the Required Participation Amount; and

     each Rating Agency and any Enhancement Providers a Tax Opinion, dated the
     Automatic Removal Date, with respect to such removal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the conditions specified in (i) that
relate to Enhancement Providers and Rating Agencies and the conditions
specified in (iv), (v) and (vi) above will not be required if all of the
Accounts to be removed have been liquidated and have zero balances. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not remove Accounts from the Trust more
than once a month.

          Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, on the Automatic Removal
Date all the right, title and interest of the Trust in and to the Receivables
arising in the Automatic Removed Accounts, all monies due and to become due
and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof shall
be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes and shall be a Removed
Account.

     SECTION 2.08 Removal of Ineligible Accounts.

          (a) On any date on which an Account becomes an Ineligible Account

manner prescribed in Section 2.08(b).

the Seller (or the Servicer on its behalf) shall take the following actions
and make the following determinations:

               (i) furnish to the Trust, the Trustee, any Agent and any
     Enhancement Providers a Removal Notice specifying the Removal
     Commencement Date and the Ineligible Accounts to be treated as Designated
     Accounts;

               (ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with respect to
     such Designated Accounts the Designated Balance with respect to each such
     Designated Account and amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Trust and

     aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account and the
     Designated Balance;

               (iii) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, cease to
     transfer to the Trust any and all Receivables arising in such Designated
     Accounts;

               (iv) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, allocate
     Collections of Principal Receivables in respect of each Designated

     Commencement Date to and until the related Removal Date, allocate (A) to
     the Trust (to be further allocated pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement), Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal
     Receivables in respect of each Designated Account, based on the ratio of
     the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in all Designated Accounts
     sold to the Trust on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of
     Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such Business
     Day and (B) to the Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and
     Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts
     on such Business Day.

          (c) Subject to Section 2.07(b), on the Removal Date with respect to
any such Designated Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with Section 2.07(b) and such Designated
Account shall be deemed removed from the Trust for all purposes (a "Removed
Account"). After the Removal Date and upon the written request of the
Servicer, the Trust and the Trustee shall deliver to the Seller a reassignment
in substantially the form of Exhibit H (the "Reassignment").

     SECTION 2.09 Sale of Ineligible Receivables.

          The Seller shall sell to the Trust on each Transfer Date any and all
Receivables arising in any Eligible Accounts that are Ineligible Receivables;
provided that (a) on the Initial Cut-Off Date or, in the case of Receivables
arising in Additional Accounts, on the related Additional Cut-Off Date, and on
the applicable Transfer Date, the Account in which such Receivables arise is

with respect to each Series or Class of Notes is adjusted in accordance with
the definition thereof set forth in the related Indenture Supplement.

     SECTION 2.10 Representations and Warranties as to the Trust's Security
Interest in the Receivables.

          The Seller makes the following representations and warranties to the
Trust as of the Effective Date and each Transfer Date:

          (a) Except as may be expressly permitted herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, this Agreement creates a valid and continuing security
interest (as defined in the UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Trust,
which security interest is prior to all other Liens and is enforceable as such
against creditors of and purchasers from the Seller.

          (b) The Receivables constitute "tangible chattel paper", "accounts"
or "payment intangibles" within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC.

          (c) The Seller has taken all necessary steps to perfect its security
interest (if any) against account debtors on the Receivables in any property
securing the Receivables.

          (d) The Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the
Receivables free and clear of any Lien of any Person, except as permitted
under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.

          (e) The Seller has caused or will have caused, within ten days after
the date of execution of this Agreement, the filing of all appropriate
financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest
in the Receivables granted to the Trust hereunder.

          (f) Other than the security interest granted to the Trust pursuant
to this Agreement, the Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a
security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables. The Seller
has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing statements
against the Seller that include a description of collateral covering the
Receivables other than any financing statement relating to the security
interest granted to the Trust hereunder or that has been terminated. The
Seller is not aware of any judgment or tax lien filings against the Seller.

          (g) The Servicer as custodian for the Trust has in its possession
all original copies of the contracts that constitute or evidence the
Receivables, and will hold all such contracts for the benefit of the Trustee.
The contracts that constitute or evidence the Receivables do not have any
marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or
otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Trust. All financing
statements filed or to be filed against the Seller in favor of the Trust in
connection herewith and describing the Receivables contain a statement to the
following effect: "A purchase of or security interest in any collateral
described in this financing statement will violate the rights of the Secured
Party".

          (h) The Seller has received all consents and approvals (if any)
required by the terms of the Receivables to the sale of the Receivables
hereunder to the Trust.


                                      40


<PAGE>


          The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.10
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Notes.
The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.10 may not be
waived or amended except upon satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition. The
Seller covenants and agrees to take such actions as are necessary to maintain
the first priority perfected security interest of the Trust in the
Receivables.

                                 ARTICLE III

                  Administration and Servicing of Receivables

     SECTION 3.01 Acceptance of Appointment and Other Matters Relating to the
Servicer.

          (a) The Servicer shall service and administer the Receivables, shall
collect payments due under the Receivables and shall charge-off as
uncollectible Receivables, all in accordance with its customary and usual
servicing procedures for servicing wholesale receivables comparable to the
Receivables which the Servicer services for its own account and in accordance
with the Floorplan Financing Guidelines. The Servicer shall have full power
and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it
hereunder, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which it may deem necessary or desirable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 10.01, the Servicer is
hereby authorized and empowered, unless such power and authority is revoked by
the Trustee on account of the occurrence of a Service Default pursuant to
Section 10.01, (i) to instruct the Trustee to make withdrawals and payments
from the Collection Account, the Excess Funding Account and any Series Account
as set forth in this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement,
(ii) to instruct the Trustee to take any action required or permitted under
any Enhancement Agreement, (iii) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Trust, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial
or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to
the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable Requirements of
Law, to commence enforcement proceedings with respect to such Receivables,
(iv) to make any filings, reports, notices, applications, registrations with,
and seek any consents or authorizations from, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and any State securities authority on behalf of the Trust as may be
necessary or advisable to comply with any Federal or State securities laws or
reporting requirement, and (v) to delegate certain of its servicing,
collection, enforcement and administrative duties hereunder with respect to
the Accounts and the Receivables to any Person who agrees to conduct such
duties in accordance with the Floorplan Financing Guidelines and this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Servicer shall notify the Trust, the
Trustee, the Rating Agencies, any Agent and any Enhancement Providers in
writing of any such delegation of its duties which is not in the ordinary
course of its business, that no delegation will relieve the Servicer of its
liability and responsibility with respect to such duties and that the Rating
Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to any such
delegation. The Trustee or the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, shall
furnish the Servicer, at its written request therefor, with any powers of
attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer
to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.


                                      41


<PAGE>


          (b) In the event that the Seller is unable for any reason to
transfer Receivables to the Trust in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement (including by reason of an Insolvency Event occurring with respect
to the Seller, the Servicer, DCS or DaimlerChrysler, or any court of competent
jurisdiction ordering that the Seller not transfer any additional Principal
Receivables to the Trust) then, in any such event, the Servicer agrees (i) to
give prompt written notice thereof to the Trust, the Trustee, any Enhancement
Providers, any Agent and each Rating Agency and (ii) that it shall in any such
event allocate after the occurrence of such event, payments on each Account
with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the oldest
principal balance of such Account, subject to the proviso set forth in Section
2.06(b), and to have such payments applied as Collections in accordance with
Sections 4.03 and 4.04. The parties hereto agree that Non-Principal
Receivables, whenever created, accrued in respect of Principal Receivables
which have been conveyed to the Trust shall continue to be a part of the
corpus of the Trust notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer of
additional Principal Receivables to the Trust and Collections with respect
thereto shall continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

          (c) The Servicer shall not, and any Successor Servicer shall not be
obligated to, use separate servicing procedures, offices, employees or
accounts for servicing the Receivables from the procedures, offices, employees
and accounts used by the Servicer in connection with servicing other wholesale
receivables.

          (d) The Servicer shall comply with and perform its servicing
obligations with respect to the Accounts and Receivables in accordance with
the Floorplan Financing Agreements relating to the Accounts and the Floorplan
Financing Guidelines, except insofar as any failure to so comply or perform
would not materially and adversely affect the rights of the Trust, the
Noteholders or any Enhancement Providers. Subject to compliance with all
Requirements of Law, the Servicer (or DCS) may change the terms and provisions
of the Floorplan Financing Agreements or the Floorplan Financing Guidelines in
any respect (including the calculation of the amount or the timing of
charge-offs and the rate of the finance charge assessed thereon), only if (i)
as a result of such change, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer no
Early Redemption Event will occur at any time and none of the Enhancement
Providers, if any, or the Noteholders shall be adversely affected, (ii) such
change is made applicable to the comparable segment of wholesale accounts
owned or serviced by the Servicer which have characteristics the same as, or
substantially similar to, the Accounts which are the subject of such change
and (iii) in the case of a reduction in the rate of such finance charges, the
Servicer (or DCS) does not reasonably expect any such reduction to result in
the Net Receivables Rate for any Collection Period being less than the
weighted average of the sum of the "Note Interest Rates" and the applicable
rate used to calculate the Aggregate Series Servicing Fee for all outstanding
Series for the related "Interest Period" (each such term as defined in the
related Indenture Supplement).

          (e) On behalf of the Trust (to the extent of the Trust's interest
therein), the Servicer hereby agrees that it holds in trust any document in
its possession evidencing or securing a Receivable and necessary for its
servicing thereof pursuant to this Agreement. The Servicer acknowledges that
it holds any documents relating to the Receivables in its possession as agent
and bailee and custodian for the use and benefit of the Trust and the Trustee.

     SECTION 3.02 Servicing Compensation.

          (a) As full compensation for its servicing activities hereunder and
reimbursement for its expenses as set forth in the immediately following
paragraph, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee on each
Payment Date on or prior to the Trust Termination Date payable in arrears. The
"Servicing Fee" payable to the Servicer on each Payment Date in respect of any
Collection Period shall equal the product of (a) the Monthly Servicing Fee
Rate and (b) the Pool Balance as of the last day of the Collection Period
second preceding such Payment Date. A portion of the Servicing Fee shall be
allocated to each Series of Notes in accordance with the related Indenture
Supplement. The portion of the Servicing Fee so allocated to any Series of
Notes shall be paid in accordance with the related Indenture Supplement only
to the extent of funds available for such payment pursuant to such Indenture
Supplement. The sum of the portions of the Servicing Fee allocable to all
Series of Notes is referred to as the "Aggregate Series Servicing Fee". The
remainder of the Servicing Fee that is not otherwise allocated to any Series
of Notes shall be paid by the Seller and in no event shall the Trust, the
Trustee or the Noteholders be liable for the share of the Servicing Fee to be
paid by the Seller.

          (b) The Servicer's expenses include the amounts due to the Trustee
pursuant to Section 807 of the Indenture and the reasonable fees and
disbursements of independent accountants and all other expenses incurred by
the Servicer in connection with its activities hereunder, and including all
other fees and expenses of the Trust not expressly stated herein to be for the
account of the Noteholders. The Servicer shall be required to pay such
expenses for its own account, and shall not be entitled to any payment
therefor other than the Servicing Fee. The Servicer will be solely responsible
for all fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Servicer in
connection herewith and the Servicer will not be entitled to any fee or other
payment from, or claim on, any of the Collateral of the Trust (other than the
Servicing Fee).

          (c) The Servicer will be permitted, in its sole discretion, to waive
all or any portion of the Servicing Fee for any Payment Date by notice to the
Trustee on or before the related Determination Date; provided that the
Servicer believes that sufficient Collections of Non-Principal Receivables
will be available on any future Payment Date to pay the Aggregate Series
Servicing Fee relating to the waived Servicing Fee. If the Servicer so waives
all or any portion of the Servicing Fee for any Payment Date, the Servicing
Fee and the Aggregate Series Servicing Fee for such Payment Date shall be
deemed to be reduced by the amount so waived for all purposes of this
Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements; provided, however,
that such Aggregate Series Servicing Fee shall be paid on a future Payment
Date solely to the extent amounts are available therefor pursuant to the
Indenture Supplements; provided, further, that, to the extent any such waived
Aggregate Series Servicing Fee is so paid, the related portion of the
Servicing Fee to be paid by the Seller shall be paid by the Seller to the
Servicer.

     SECTION 3.03 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Servicer.

          (a) DCS, as Servicer, hereby makes, and any Successor Servicer by
its appointment hereunder shall make, on the Effective Date and each
subsequent Closing Date (and on the date of any such appointment) the
following representations, warranties and covenants:


                                      43

               (i) Organization and Good Standing. Such party is a limited
     liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
     under the applicable laws of the state of its formation and has, in all
     material respects, full corporate power, authority and legal rights to
     own its properties and conduct its wholesale receivable servicing
     business as such properties are presently owned and as such business is
     presently conducted, and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
     under this Agreement.

               (ii) Due Qualification. Such party is duly qualified to do
     business and is in good standing as a foreign limited liability company
     (or is exempt from such requirements) and has obtained all necessary
     licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in which the servicing of the
     Receivables as required by this Agreement requires such qualification
     except where the failure to so qualify or obtain licenses or approvals
     would not have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its
     obligations hereunder.

               (iii) Due Authorization. The execution, delivery, and
     performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by such party by
     all necessary corporate action on the part thereof.

               (iv) Binding Obligation. This Agreement constitutes a legal,
     valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable in accordance
     with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
     now or hereinafter in effect, affecting the enforcement of creditors'
     rights and except as such enforceability may be limited by general
     principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
     equity).

               (v) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
     by such party, the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof applicable
     to such party will not conflict with, violate, result in any breach of
     any of the material terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or
     without notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under, any
     Requirement of Law applicable to such party or any indenture, contract,
     agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to which such
     party is a party or by which it is bound.

               (vi) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or, to the best
     knowledge of such party, investigations, pending or threatened against
     such party before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
     other tribunal or governmental instrumentality seeking to prevent the
     issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, seeking any determination or ruling that,
     in the reasonable judgment of such party, would materially and adversely
     affect the performance by such party of its obligations under this
     Agreement, or seeking any determination or ruling that would materially
     and adversely affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

               (vii) Compliance with Requirements of Law. Such party shall duly
     satisfy all obligations on its part to be fulfilled under or in
     connection with the


                                      44


<PAGE>


     Receivables and the Accounts, will maintain in effect all qualifications
     required under Requirements of Law in order to service properly the
     Receivables and the Accounts and will comply in all material respects
     with all Requirements of Law in connection with servicing the Receivables
     and the Accounts the failure to comply with which would have a material
     adverse effect on the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or any
     Enhancement Providers.

               (viii) No Rescission or Cancellation. Such party shall not
     permit any rescission or cancellation of a Receivable except as ordered
     by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority.

               (ix) Protection of Secured Parties' Rights. Such party shall
     take no action, nor omit to take any action, which would impair the
     rights of the Trust, the Noteholders or any Enhancement Providers in the
     Receivables nor shall it reschedule, revise or defer payments due on any
     Receivable except in accordance with the Floorplan Financing Guidelines.

               (x) Servicer Concentration Account. The Servicer maintains
     deposit accounts (collectively, the "Concentration Account") into which
     it shall deposit all amounts paid by the Dealers under Floorplan
     Financing Agreements. The Servicer agrees (i) that it will not change
     this method of collection without the prior written consent of any
     Enhancement Providers and any Agents; (ii) with respect to amounts
     deposited into the Concentration Account in respect of a particular day,
     that it will not transfer such amounts from the Concentration Account
     until the Servicer has posted all Collections in respect of the
     Receivables for such day and (iii) concurrently with the transfer of
     amounts from the Concentration Account in respect of a particular day,
     the Servicer will make the deposits and transfers required by the terms
     of this Agreement for such day.

               (xi) Negative Pledge. Except for the conveyance hereunder to the
     Trust and the Liens permitted under the Transaction Documents, the
     Servicer will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person,
     or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on, any
     Receivable sold and assigned to the Trust, whether now existing or
     hereafter created, or any interest therein, and the Servicer shall defend
     the rights, title and interest of the Trust in, to and under any
     Receivable sold and assigned to the Trust, whether now existing or
     hereafter created, against all claims of third parties claiming through
     or under the Seller or the Servicer.

          (b) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 3.03 shall survive the transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Trust and the issuance of the Notes. Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Servicer, the Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Agent or the Trustee
of a breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties
specified above, and to any Enhancement Providers.

          (c) Purchase. In the event any representation or warranty under
Section 3.03(a)(vii), (viii) or (ix) is not true and correct in any material
respect as of the date specified


                                      45


<PAGE>


therein with respect to any Receivable or Account and such breach has a
material adverse effect on the Noteholders' Interest in such Receivable, then,
within 30 days (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee) of
the earlier to occur of the discovery of any such event by the Seller or the
Servicer, or receipt by the Seller or the Servicer of written notice of any
such event given by the Trustee or any Enhancement Providers, the Servicer
shall purchase such Receivable or, in the case of an untrue representation
with respect to an Account, all Receivables in such Account, on the
Determination Date immediately succeeding the expiration of such 30-day period
on the terms and conditions set forth in the next succeeding paragraph;
provided, however, that no such purchase shall be required to be made with
respect to such Receivable if, by the end of such 30-day period (or such
longer period as may be agreed to by the Trustee) the breached representation
or warranty shall then be true and correct in all material respects and any
material adverse effect caused thereby shall have been cured. The Servicer
shall effect such purchase by depositing in the Collection Account in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Purchase Price of such
Receivable. Any such deposit of such Purchase Price into the Collection
Account shall be considered a Transfer Deposit Amount and shall be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          Upon each such payment of such Purchase Price, the Trust shall
automatically and without further action be deemed to sell, transfer, assign,
set over and otherwise convey to the Servicer, without recourse,
representation or warranty, all right, title and interest of the Trust in and
to such Receivables, all monies due or to become due with respect thereto and
all proceeds thereof and the related Collateral Security. The Trustee shall
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall be reasonably requested by the Servicer to effect the
conveyance of any such Receivables pursuant to this Section. The obligation of
the Servicer to purchase such Receivables, and to make the deposits required
to be made to the Collection Account as provided in the preceding paragraph,
shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to such
obligation available to the Trust, the Noteholders (or the Trustee on behalf
of Noteholders).

     SECTION 3.04 Reports and Instructions for the Trustee.

          Pursuant to Section 907 of the Indenture, the Servicer will
cooperate with the Trust in completing and delivering to the Indenture Trustee
(with a copy to each Note Rating Agency) the Monthly Noteholders' Statements
provided for therein. Pursuant to Section 908 of the Indenture, the Servicer
will cooperate with the Trust in completing and delivering to the Indenture
Trustee the Payment Instructions provided for therein. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the Servicer shall calculate certain of the amounts and
percentages to be included in the Monthly Noteholders' Statements and the
Payment Instructions.

     SECTION 3.05 Annual Servicer's Certificate.

          The Servicer will deliver to the Rating Agencies, the Trustee, the
Trust, any Agent and any Enhancement Providers on or before March 31 of each
calendar year, beginning with March 31, 2005, an Officers' Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit C stating that (a) a review of the
activities of the Servicer during the preceding calendar year and of its
performance under this Agreement was made under the supervision of the officer
signing such certificate and (b) to the best of such officer's knowledge,
based on such review, the Servicer has


                                      46


<PAGE>


performed in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement
throughout such year, or, if there has been a material default in the
performance of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such
officer and the nature and status thereof. A copy of such certificate may be
obtained by any Noteholder by a request in writing to the Trustee addressed to
the Corporate Trust Office. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 3.05, the Servicer, in its sole discretion, may deliver, in lieu of
(or in addition to) the Officers' Certificate referred to above in this
Section 3.05, the report on compliance with servicing criteria that would be
required to be filed in respect of the Trust under the Exchange Act if
periodic reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or any successor
provision thereto, were required to be filed in respect of the Trust.

     SECTION 3.06 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
Report.


          The Servicer shall cause a firm of independent certified public
accountants, who may also render other services to the Servicer or to the
Seller, to deliver to the Trustee, the Trust, the Rating Agencies, each Agent
and each Enhancement Provider on or before March 31 of each year, beginning
March 31, 2005, a report addressed to the Servicer and to the Trustee, to the
effect that such firm has examined the financial statements of the Servicer
or, if applicable, the parent corporation of the Servicer, and issued its
report thereon and that such examination: (a) was made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as such firm
considered necessary in the circumstances, (b) included tests relating to
wholesale receivables (including financing arrangements with automobile
dealers to finance their automobile and light-duty truck inventory) serviced
for others in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, to the extent the procedures in such
program are applicable to the servicing obligations set forth in this
Agreement and (c) except as described in the report, disclosed no exceptions
or errors in the records relating to wholesale receivables (including
financing arrangements with automobile dealers to finance their automobile and
light-duty truck inventory) serviced for others that, in the firm's opinion,
paragraph four of such Uniform Single Attestation Program requires such firm
to report. A copy of such report may be obtained by any Noteholder by a
request in writing to the Trustee addressed to the Corporate Trust Office.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.06, the Servicer,
in its sole discretion, may deliver, in lieu of the accountants' report
referred to above in this Section 3.06, the attestation report of a registered
public accounting firm that would be required to be filed in respect of the
Trust under the Exchange Act if periodic reports under Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or any successor provision thereto, were required to be filed in
respect of the Trust.

     SECTION 3.07 Tax Treatment.

          The Seller has entered into this Agreement with the intention that
the Notes will qualify under applicable tax law as indebtedness secured by the
Receivables. The Seller agrees to treat the Notes as indebtedness secured by
the Receivables for Federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise
taxes, Michigan Single Business tax and any other taxes imposed on or measured
by income.


                                      47

     SECTION 3.08 Notices to DCS.

          In the event DCS is no longer acting as Servicer, any Successor
Servicer appointed pursuant to Section 10.02 shall deliver or make available
to DCS, as the case may be, each certificate and report required to be
prepared, forwarded or delivered thereafter pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.05
and 3.06.

     SECTION 3.09 Adjustments.

          (a) The Servicer shall adjust downward, subject to the following
sentence, the amount of any Principal Receivable because of a rebate, refund,
credit adjustment or billing error to a Dealer, or because such Receivable was
created in respect of a Vehicle which was refused or returned by a Dealer. If,
following any such adjustment downward, the Pool Balance would be less than
the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount on the immediately preceding
Determination Date (after giving effect to the allocations, distributions,
withdrawals and deposits to be made on the Payment Date following such
Determination Date), then the Seller shall be required to pay an amount equal
to such deficiency (up to the amount of such adjustment) into the Collection
Account on the Business Day on which such adjustment or reduction occurs (each
such payment, an "Adjustment Payment"). If the Seller shall fail to make any
deposit to the Collection Account with respect to such Adjustment Payment or
portion thereof by the Determination Date relating to the Collection Period
with respect to which such Adjustment Payment is payable, the amount of such
Adjustment Payment or portion thereof shall be allocated on such related
Determination Date pro rata among the then-outstanding Series based on their
respective Series Nominal Liquidation Amounts for the Collection Period with
respect to which such deposit should have been made.

          (b) If (i) the Servicer makes a deposit into the Collection Account
in respect of a Collection of a Receivable and such collection was received by
the Servicer in the form of a check which is not honored for any reason or
(ii) the Servicer makes a mistake with respect to the amount of any Collection
and deposits an amount that is less than or more than the actual amount of
such Collection, the Servicer shall appropriately adjust the amount
subsequently deposited into the Collection Account to reflect such dishonored
check or mistake. Any Receivable in respect of which a dishonored check is
received shall be deemed not to have been paid.

     SECTION 3.10 Dealer Concentrations.

          (a) On the last day of each Collection Period, the Servicer shall,
for purposes of determining the Required Participation Percentage for any
Series, determine (a) if the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables due
from either AutoNation, Inc. and its affiliates or United Auto Group, Inc. and
its affiliates at the close of business on such last day is greater than 4% of
the Pool Balance on such last day and (b) if the aggregate amount of Principal
Receivables due from any other Dealer or group of affiliated Dealers at the
close of business on such last day is greater than 1.5% of the Pool Balance on
such last day. The Servicer shall promptly provide the Trust and the Trustee a
report setting forth the basis for such determination. The Trustee upon
request from any Rating Agency will make such report available to such Rating
Agency.


                                      48


<PAGE>


          (b) On the last day of each Collection Period, the Servicer shall,
for purposes of determining the Dealer Overconcentrations that are used to
calculate the "Incremental Overcollateralization Amount" (as defined in the
related Indenture Supplement) for any Series, determine (a) if the aggregate
amount of Principal Receivables due from either AutoNation, Inc. and its
affiliates or United Auto Group, Inc. and its affiliates at the close of
business on such last day is greater than 4% of the Pool Balance on such last
day and (b) if the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables due from any
other Dealer or group of affiliated Dealers at the close of business on such
last day is greater than 2% of the Pool Balance on such last day. The Servicer
shall promptly provide the Trust and the Trustee a report setting forth the
basis for such determination. The Trustee upon request from any Rating Agency
will make such report available to such Rating Agency.

                                  ARTICLE IV

                            DEPOSIT, Allocation and
                 Application of Collections AND OTHER AMOUNTS

     SECTION 4.01 Interests in Receivables and Other Collateral.

          The Notes issued by the Trust shall represent obligations of the
Trust secured by the Collateral, which, with respect to each Series or Class,
will consist of the right to receive, to the extent necessary to make the
required payments with respect to such Series or Class at the times and in the
amounts specified in the related Indenture Supplement, (i) the portion of
Collections allocable to such Series or Class pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indenture and the related Indenture Supplement, (ii) the funds and other
property credited to the Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account (or
any subaccounts thereof) allocable to such Series or Class pursuant to this
Agreement, the Indenture and such Indenture Supplement, (iii) funds and other
property credited to any related Series Account and (iv) funds available
pursuant to any related Enhancement Agreement (such property collectively,
with respect to all Series and all Classes, the "Noteholders' Interest"); it
being understood that the Notes of any Series or Class shall not represent any
interest in any Series Account or Enhancement Agreement for the benefit of any
other Series or Class. The Seller's Certificates shall represent the ownership
interest in the remainder of the Collateral and other property of the Trust
not allocated pursuant to this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture
Supplement to the Noteholders' Interest and shall include the right to receive
Collections with respect to the Receivables and other amounts at the times and
in the amounts specified in this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture
Supplement to be released to the Trust (the "Seller's Interest"); provided,
however, that the Seller's Certificates shall not represent any interest in
the Collection Account, the Excess Funding Account, any Series Account or any
Enhancement Agreement, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the
Indenture or any Indenture Supplement.

     SECTION 4.02 Deposits of Collections into the Collection Account.

          (a) From and after the Effective Date, the Servicer shall no longer
deposit Collections into the CARCO Collection Account, and instead shall
deposit Collections directly into the Collection Account established and
maintained in the name of the Trustee pursuant to


                                      49


<PAGE>


Section 402(a) of the Indenture. The Servicer shall make deposits into the
Collection Account at such times and in such amounts as specified below in
this Section 4.02.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.02(c), the Servicer
shall deposit Collections into the Collection Account as promptly as possible
after the Date of Processing of such Collections, but in no event later than
the second Business Day after such Date of Processing.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
so long as (i) DCS remains the Servicer hereunder, (ii) no Service Default has
occurred and is continuing and (iii)(x) DCS maintains a short-term rating of
at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's (and has maintained such
short-term ratings for five Business Days following any reduction of either
such rating), (y) DCS arranges for and maintains a letter of credit or other
form of enhancement in respect of the Servicer's obligations to make deposits
of collections on the Receivables in the Collection Account that is acceptable
in form and substance to each Rating Agency and any Agents or (z) DCS
otherwise obtains the Rating Agency confirmations described below, then,
subject to any limitations in the confirmations described below, the Servicer
need not make the daily deposits of Collections into the Collection Account as
provided in this Section 4.02, but may make a single deposit into the
Collection Account in same-day or next-day funds not later than 11:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the Payment Date in a net amount equal to the amount
which would have been on deposit with respect to the immediately preceding
Collection Period in the Collection Account; provided, however, that prior to
ceasing daily deposits as described above the Seller shall have delivered to
the Trustee written confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies that the
failure by DCS to make daily deposits will not result in a reduction or
withdrawal of the rating of any outstanding Series or Class. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4.02(c), if DCS no longer maintains a
short-term rating from either Standard & Poor's or Moody's, DCS may continue
to make monthly net deposits of Collections into the Collection Account in
accordance with this Section 4.02(c) so long as (i) DCS remains the Servicer
hereunder, (ii) no Service Default has occurred and is continuing and (iii)
DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corporation maintains a short-term
rating of at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's (and has
maintained such short-term ratings for five Business Days following any
reduction of either such rating).

          (d) Subject to Section 4.04, but notwithstanding anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any Collection Period, whether
the Servicer is required to make deposits of Collections pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) above, (i) the Servicer will only be required to deposit
Collections into the Collection Account up to the aggregate amount of
Collections required to be deposited into the Excess Funding Account or any
Series Account or, without duplication, distributed on the related Payment
Date to Noteholders, to any Agent or to any Enhancement Provider pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement or Enhancement
Agreement and (ii) if at any time prior to such Payment Date the amount of
Collections deposited in the Collection Account exceeds the amount required to
be deposited pursuant to clause (i) above, the Servicer will be permitted to
withdraw the excess from the Collection Account.

          (e) Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in Section
3.01(a), the Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the Trustee, to
instruct the Trustee to make


                                      50


<PAGE>


withdrawals and payments from the Collection Account for the purposes of
carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's duties specified in this
Agreement, the Indenture or an Indenture Supplement, as the case may be.

     SECTION 4.03 Allocations of Collections and Other Amounts to Each
Series.

          (a) All Interest Collections, Principal Collections, Miscellaneous
Payments and Defaulted Amounts will be allocated to each Series from and after
the related Series Cut-Off Date according to the applicable Series Allocation
Percentage for such Series, as specified in the related Indenture Supplement.
Interest Collections, Principal Collections and Miscellaneous Payments so
allocated to any Series will not be available for the benefit of any other
Series, except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Indenture or the related Indenture Supplements, as the case may be.
Allocations of Interest Collections, Principal Collections and Miscellaneous
Payments to be performed by the Servicer (i) with respect to each Series and
(ii) if applicable, among the Classes of a Series and any related Enhancement
Provider will be set forth in the related Indenture Supplement or Supplements.
The application of such allocated Interest Collections, Principal Collections
and Miscellaneous Payments will also be set forth in the related Indenture
Supplement or Supplements.

          (b) For purposes of determining each Series' Series Allocation
Percentage in connection with the allocation of Interest Collections,
Principal Collections, Miscellaneous Payments and Defaulted Amounts for the
specified Collection Period:

               (i) unless the related Indenture Supplement shall provide
     otherwise, each Series upon issuance shall be deemed to have been created
     and in existence as of the first day of the first Collection Period to
     occur after the Series Cut-Off Date and, as a result, shall be allocated
     (based on its applicable Series Allocation Percentage) its allocable
     portion of Interest Collections, Principal Collections, Defaulted Amounts
     and Miscellaneous Payments for such Collection Period; and

               (ii) unless the related Indenture Supplement shall provide
     otherwise, with respect to any Series, if (x) as of the last day of any
     Collection Period the amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, the
     Excess Funding Account and the related Series Accounts with respect to
     such Collection Period are sufficient to pay in full all amounts payable
     by the Trust on or with respect to the Notes of such Series on the
     Payment Date relating to such Collection Period (after giving effect to
     the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on
     such related Payment Date) then (y) such Series shall be deemed to have
     been paid in full on such last day and, as a result, shall not be
     allocated any portion of Interest Collections, Principal Collections,
     Defaulted Amounts and Miscellaneous Payments for any subsequent
     Collection Period. For purposes of making the determination in clause (x)
     above, on the date of any such determination it shall be assumed that any
     theretofore unpaid Adjustment Payments with respect to the immediately
     preceding Collection Period shall be allocated to such Series on the
     related Determination Date and shall be payable from amounts allocated to
     or available with respect to such Series on the related Payment Date.

     SECTION 4.04 Allocations of Collections to the Seller.


          (a) Subject to Sections 4.04(c) and (d), the Servicer shall instruct
the Trustee on each Deposit Date to withdraw an amount equal to the Seller's
Percentage for the related Collection Period of Interest Collections deposited
in the Collection Account for such Deposit Date (the "Seller's Interest
Collections") and to release such Seller's Interest Collections to the Trust
for distribution in respect of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust
Agreement.

          (b) Subject to Section 4.04(c) and (d), the Servicer shall instruct
the Trustee on each Deposit Date to withdraw an amount equal to the Seller's
Percentage for the related Collection Period of Principal Collections
deposited in the Collection Account for such Deposit Date (the "Seller's
Principal Collections") and to release such Seller's Principal Collections to
the Trust for distribution in respect of the Seller's Certificates pursuant to
the Trust Agreement, so long as the Pool Balance (determined after giving
effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on such Payment
Date) equals or exceeds the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount for
the immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect to the
allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on such
Payment Date); it being understood that any Seller's Principal Collections not
otherwise released to the Trust as a result of the condition specified in this
Section 4.04(b) shall be retained in the Collection Account and included as
part of the Unallocated Principal Collections held therein.

          (c) The withdrawals to be made from the Collection Account pursuant
to Section 4.04(a) or (b) do not apply to deposits into the Collection Account
that do not represent Collections, including Miscellaneous Payments, payment
of the purchase price for the Noteholders' Interest pursuant to Section 2.03,
and proceeds from the sale, disposition or liquidation of Receivables pursuant
to an exercise of the "Put Feature" under and as defined in the Indenture or
any Indenture Supplement.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 4.04(a) or (b), with respect to each
Payment Date the Servicer shall instruct the Trustee to retain the Note PFA
Earnings Shortfall for such Payment Date from the amounts that would otherwise
be released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the Seller's
Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement and to apply such Note PFA
Earnings Shortfall under the Indenture Supplements.

     SECTION 4.05 Repurchased Receivables Purchase Price Payments.

          On each Payment Date, amounts on deposit in the Collection Account
on such Payment Date resulting from payment by the Seller of the Repurchased
Receivables Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.07(c) shall be applied as
follows: first, to fund any unpaid Miscellaneous Payments due on or prior to
such Payment Date and second, an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount
of the Repurchased Receivables Purchase Price initially deposited by the
Seller in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 2.07(c) and (ii) the
Monthly Payment Rate for the immediately preceding Collection Period, shall be
treated as Principal Collections collected in the immediately preceding
Collection Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including Section 2.07(c), the Seller shall not be required to make any
deposit into the Collection Account in respect of the Repurchased Receivables
Purchase


                                      52


<PAGE>


Price of any receivables repurchased by the Seller from the Trust pursuant to
this Agreement, including Section 2.07(c).

     SECTION 4.06 Excess Funding Account; Deposits, Allocations and
Withdrawals.

          (a) From and after the Effective Date, Excess Available Principal
Amounts shall no longer be subject to deposit into the CARCO Excess Funding
Account as provided in Section 4.04 of the Series 2002-CC Supplement, and
instead shall be subject to deposit by the Trustee into the Excess Funding
Account established and maintained in the name of the Trustee pursuant to
Section 402(b) of the Indenture. The Trustee shall make deposits into the
Excess Funding Account at such times and in such amounts as specified below in
this Section 4.06.

          (b) On each Payment Date, commencing with the initial Payment Date
hereunder, the aggregate amount of Excess Available Principal Amounts, if any,
for the related Collection Period shall be applied as follows:

               (i) first, deposited into the Excess Funding Account in an
     amount equal to the excess, if any, of:

                    (A) the sum of (1) the aggregate Outstanding Dollar
          Principal Amount of all Series of Notes and (2) the sum of the
          Overcollateralization Amounts for all Series of Notes; over

                    (B) the sum of (1) the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation
          Amount, (2) the aggregate amount on deposit in the Principal Funding
          Accounts (other than any net investment earnings) for all Series of
          Notes and (3) the amount on deposit in the Excess Funding Account
          (other than any net investment earnings); it being understood that,
          solely for the purpose of this subclause (B), the Aggregate Series
          Nominal Liquidation Amount will be reduced by an amount equal to the
          quotient obtained by dividing (x) the excess, if any, of the
          Required Participation Amount (less the sum of the Incremental
          Overcollateralization Amounts for all Series) over the Pool Balance
          (less the sum of the Overconcentration Amount and the aggregate
          amount of Ineligible Receivables), in each case, after giving effect
          to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust on that
          Payment Date and the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
          deposits to be made on that Payment Date (other than any deposits
          into the Excess Funding Account that may be required to be made on
          that Payment Date) by (y) the sum of the weighted average of the
          Required Participation Percentages for each Series of Notes plus the
          weighted average of the Overcollateralization Percentages used
          for purposes of determining the Overcollateralization Amounts for
          each Series of Notes; and

               (ii) second, after giving effect to the immediately preceding
     clause (i), the remaining Excess Available Principal Amounts, if any,
     shall be released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the
     Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement, so long as the
     Pool Balance (determined after giving effect to any Principal Receivables
     transferred to the Trust on such Payment Date) equals or exceeds the
     Aggregate Series


                                      53


<PAGE>


     Nominal Liquidation Amount for the immediately preceding Determination
     Date (after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals
     and deposits to be made on such Payment Date); it being understood that
     any Excess Available Principal Amounts not otherwise paid to the Trust as
     a result of the condition specified in this clause (ii) shall be
     transferred to the Collection Account and included as part of the
     Unallocated Principal Collections held therein.

          (c) All interest and earnings (net of losses and investment
expenses) on funds on deposit in the Excess Funding Account shall be allocated
to each Series of Notes pro rata on the basis of its Series Nominal
Liquidation Amount and on each Payment Date shall be withdrawn by the Trustee
for application under the Indenture Supplement for such Series of Notes;
provided, however, that beginning on the second Payment Date following the end
of the revolving period for a Series of Notes, no further net investment
earnings on funds in the Excess Funding Account shall be allocated to such
Series of Notes, unless the revolving period for such Series has recommenced
in accordance with the related Indenture Supplement.

          (d) Amounts (other than investment earnings) being deposited to the
Excess Funding Account from Excess Available Principal Amounts pursuant to
Section 4.06(b)(i) shall be allocated to each Series of Notes (other than any
Series of Notes that is not in its revolving period) pro rata on the basis of
its Series Nominal Liquidation Amount. On the Payment Date next following the
end of the revolving period for a Series of Notes, any funds (other than
investment earnings) on deposit in the Excess Funding Account that are
allocable to such Series of Notes shall be withdrawn by the Trustee for
application under the Indenture Supplement for such Series of Notes.

          (e) On each Determination Date, the Seller shall determine whether
the sum of the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount (after giving
effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made
on the Payment Date following such Determination Date), the amount on deposit
in the Excess Funding Account (other than any investment earnings) and the
amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Accounts for all Series of Notes
(other than any investment earnings) is greater than the aggregate Outstanding
Dollar Principal Amount of all Series of Notes plus the aggregate
Overcollateralization Amount for all Series of Notes. If on any such
Determination Date such sum is greater than the aggregate Outstanding
Principal Dollar Amount of all Series of Notes plus the aggregate
Overcollateralization Amount for all Series of Notes and thus there are
sufficient Principal Receivables in the Trust to permit an increase in the
Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount without causing an Early
Redemption Event to occur with respect to any outstanding Series of Notes, the
Seller shall notify the Trustee of the amount of the increase in the Aggregate
Series Nominal Liquidation Amount. Subject to the provisions set forth below
in this Section 4.06(e), upon receipt of such notice, the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount shall be increased by the amount specified, and the
Servicer shall instruct the Trustee to withdraw from the Excess Funding
Account and release to the Trust for distribution pursuant to the Trust
Agreement on the immediately succeeding Payment Date, an amount equal to the
amount of such increase in the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount.
Such payment shall be in payment or partial payment pursuant to the
Receivables Purchase Agreement for additional Principal Receivables
transferred to the Trust. To the extent that the Aggregate Series Nominal
Liquidation Amount is increased by release of funds to the Trust, the Seller's
Interest shall be


                                      54


<PAGE>


reduced by the amount of such payment. Such increase in the Aggregate Series
Nominal Liquidation Amount shall be allocated among each Series of Notes
(other than any Series of Notes that is not in its revolving period) pro rata
on the basis of the Series Nominal Liquidation Amounts of such Series of
Notes. In addition, any increase in the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation
Amount is subject to the condition that, after giving effect to such increase,
the Pool Balance equals or exceeds the Required Participation Amount (after
giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits). In
connection with the foregoing release of funds from the Excess Funding
Account, the Seller shall endeavor (taking into account any seasonality
experienced in the Accounts in the Trust) to minimize the amounts on deposit,
from time to time, in the Excess Funding Account.

          (f) Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in Section
3.01(a), the Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the Trustee, to
instruct the Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the Excess Funding
Account for the purposes of carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's
duties specified in this Agreement, the Indenture or an Indenture Supplement,
as the case may be.

     SECTION 4.07 Unallocated Principal Collections.

          The sum of those Seller's Principal Collections retained in the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 4.04(b) and those Excess Available
Principal Amounts transferred to the Collection Account pursuant to Section
4.06(b)(ii) (such sum, the "Unallocated Principal Collections") shall be
released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the Seller's Certificates
pursuant to the Trust Agreement at the time the Pool Balance (determined after
giving effect to any Principal Receivables transferred to the Trust at such
time) exceeds the Aggregate Series Nominal Liquidation Amount for the
immediately preceding Determination Date (after giving effect to the
allocations, distributions, withdrawals and deposits to be made on the Payment
Date immediately following such Determination Date); provided, however, that
any Unallocated Principal Collections on deposit in the Collection Account at
any time during which any Series is not in its revolving period shall be
deemed to be Miscellaneous Payments and shall be allocated to each Series as
provided in Section 4.03(a).

                     OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE SELLER

     SECTION 7.01 Liability of the Seller.

          The Seller shall be liable for all obligations, covenants,
representations and warranties of the Seller arising under or related to this
Agreement. Except as provided in the


                                      55


<PAGE>


preceding sentence, the Seller shall be liable only to the extent of the
obligations specifically undertaken by it in its capacity as Seller hereunder.

     SECTION 7.02 Limitation on Liability of the Seller.

          Subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.03, neither the Seller nor any of the
directors or officers or employees or agents of the Seller in its capacity as
Seller shall be under any liability to the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the
Trustee, the Noteholders or any other Person for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in the capacity as Seller pursuant to
this Agreement whether arising from express or implied duties under this
Agreement; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Seller
or any such Person against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by
reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and
duties hereunder. The Seller and any director or officer or employee or agent
of the Seller may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie
properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising
hereunder.

     SECTION 7.03 Seller Indemnification of the Trust, the Trustee, the
Owner Trustee and the Enhancement Providers.

          The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trustee,
the Owner Trustee and the Enhancement Providers, from and against any loss,
liability, expense, damage or injury suffered or sustained by reason of any
acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions arising out of activities of the
Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, including
any judgment, award, settlement, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs or
expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened
action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that the Seller shall not
indemnify the Trust, the Trustee, the Owner Trustee or any Enhancement
Provider if the acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions of such Person
constitute fraud, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty or willful
misconduct by such Person; and provided, further, that the Seller shall not
indemnify the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee for any liabilities,
cost or expense of the Trust with respect to any action taken by such Person
at the request of any Noteholder, Enhancement Provider or holder of a
Supplemental Certificate to the extent the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, is indemnified by such Noteholder, Enhancement
Provider or holder of a Supplemental Certificate with respect to such action,
or with respect to any Federal, state or local income or franchise taxes (or
any interest or penalties with respect thereto) required to be paid by the
Trust or any Noteholder, Enhancement Provider or holder of a Supplemental
Certificate in connection herewith or with the Notes, the Indenture, any
Indenture Supplement, any Enhancement Agreement, the Supplemental Certificates
or the Trust Agreement to any taxing authority. Subject to Section 7.01, any
indemnification pursuant to this Section shall only be from (i) the excess of
the Seller's Interest for any date of determination over the Required
Participation Amount as of such date and (ii) any other assets of the Seller
not pledged to third parties or otherwise encumbered in a manner permitted by
the Seller's organizational documents and shall only be made after payment in
full of any amounts that the Seller is obligated to deposit in the Collection
Account pursuant to this Agreement. Any indemnification under this Article VII
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

under any liability to the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee, the
Noteholders or any other Person for any action taken or for refraining from

          The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the

any acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions arising out of activities of
the Servicer, the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee pursuant to this

willful misconduct by such Person; and provided, further, that the Servicer
shall not indemnify the Trust, the Trustee or the Owner Trustee for any

Provider or holder of a Seller's Certificate with respect to such action, or
with respect to any Federal, state or local income or franchise taxes (or any
interest or penalties with respect thereto) required to be paid by the Trust
or any Noteholder, Enhancement Provider or holder of a Seller's Certificate in
connection herewith or with the Notes, the Indenture, any Indenture
Supplement, any Enhancement Agreement, the Seller's Certificates or the Trust
Agreement to any taxing authority. Any indemnification under this Article VIII
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation and
removal of the Trustee.

     SECTION 8.05 The Servicer Not to Resign.

          The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon determination that (a) the performance of its duties
hereunder is no longer permissible under applicable law and (b) there is no
reasonable action which the Servicer could take to make the performance of its
duties hereunder permissible under applicable law. Any such determination
permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced as to clause (a)
above by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Trust and the
Trustee. No such resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or a
Successor Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of
the Servicer in accordance with Section 10.02 hereof. If the Trustee is unable
within 120 days of the date of such determination to appoint a Successor
Servicer, the Trustee shall serve as Successor Servicer hereunder.

     SECTION 8.06 Access to Certain Documentation and Information
Regarding the Receivables.

          The Servicer shall provide to the Trustee access to the
documentation regarding the Accounts and the Receivables in such cases where
the Trustee is required in connection with the enforcement of the rights of
the Noteholders, or by applicable statutes or regulations to review such
documentation, such access being afforded without charge but only (a) upon
reasonable request, (b) during normal business hours, (c) subject to the
Servicer's normal security and confidentiality procedures and (d) at offices
designated by the Servicer. Nothing in


                                      59


<PAGE>


this Section 8.06 shall derogate from the obligation of the Seller, the Trust,
the Trustee or the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting
disclosure of information regarding the Dealers and the failure of the
Servicer to provide access as provided in this Section 8.06 as a result of
such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section 8.06.

     SECTION 8.07 Delegation of Duties.

          Subject to Section 3.01, in the ordinary course of business, the
Servicer may at any time delegate any duties hereunder to any Person who
agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with the Floorplan Financing
Guidelines and this Agreement. The Servicer shall give prompt written notice
of any such delegation of a material function to the Note Rating Agencies, any
Agent and any Enhancement Providers. Such delegation shall not relieve the
Servicer of its liability and responsibility with respect to such duties, and
shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section 8.05 and the
Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to such
delegation prior to such delegation.

     SECTION 8.08 Examination of Records.

          The Seller and the Servicer shall indicate generally in its computer
files or other records that the Receivables arising in the Accounts have been
conveyed to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller and the Servicer
shall, prior to the sale or transfer to a third party of any receivable held
in its custody, examine its computer and other records to determine that such
receivable is not a Receivable.

     SECTION 8.09 Optional Repurchase by the Servicer.

          Pursuant to Section 1202 of the Indenture, and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, the Servicer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to cause the Trust to redeem a Series or Class of Notes in whole
but not in part by paying to the Trust the applicable redemption price for
such Series or Class of Notes.

          (a) any failure by the Servicer to make any payment, transfer or
deposit or to give instructions or to give notice to the Trustee to make such
payment, transfer or deposit or to give notice to the Trustee as to any action

instruction or notice is required to be made or given, as the case may be,
under the terms of this Agreement, the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement;

          (b) failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or perform
any other covenants or agreements of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement,
the Indenture or any Indenture Supplement which has a material adverse effect
on the Noteholders of any Series, which continues unremedied for a period of
30 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the
same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the Trustee; or
the Servicer shall delegate its duties under this Agreement, except as
permitted by Sections 3.01 and 8.07;

          (c) any representation, warranty or certification made by the
Servicer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall prove to have been incorrect when made, which has a material
adverse effect on the rights of the Noteholders of any Series and which
material adverse effect continues for a period of 60 days after the date on
which written notice thereof, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
been given to the Servicer by the Trustee;

          (d) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator
or receiver or liquidator or other similar official in any bankruptcy,
insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or
similar proceedings of or relating to the Servicer or of or relating to all or
substantially all of its property, or a decree or order of a court or agency
or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises for the
appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or other similar
official in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and
liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of
its affairs, shall have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or
order shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed; or the Servicer
shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization statute, make any assignment for the benefit of
its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations;

then, in the event of any Service Default, so long as the Service Default
shall not have been remedied, the Trustee, by notice then given in writing to
the Servicer (a "Termination Notice"), may terminate all but not less than all
of the rights and obligations (other than its obligations that have accrued up
to the time of such termination) of the Servicer as Servicer under this
Agreement and in and to the Receivables and the proceeds thereof. After
receipt by the Servicer of a Termination Notice, and on the date that a
Successor Servicer shall have been appointed by the Trustee pursuant to
Section 10.02, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement
shall pass to and be vested in a Successor Servicer (a "Service Transfer")
and, without limitation, the Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered (upon
the failure of the Servicer to cooperate) to execute and deliver, on behalf of
the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other
instruments upon the failure of the Servicer to execute or deliver such
documents or instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such Service Transfer. The
Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Trustee and such Successor Servicer in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer
to conduct servicing hereunder, including the transfer to such Successor
Servicer of all authority of the Servicer to service the Receivables provided
for


                                      61
<PAGE>


under this Agreement, including all authority over all Collections which shall
on the date of transfer be held by the Servicer for deposit, or which have
been deposited by the Servicer, in the Collection Account, or which shall
thereafter be received with respect to the Receivables, and in assisting the
Successor Servicer. The Servicer shall promptly transfer its electronic
records relating to the Receivables to the Successor Servicer in such
electronic form as the Successor Servicer may reasonably request and shall
promptly transfer to the Successor Servicer all other records, correspondence
and documents necessary for the continued servicing of the Receivables in the
manner and at such times as the Successor Servicer shall reasonably request.
To the extent that compliance with this Section 10.01 shall require the
Servicer to disclose to the Successor Servicer information of any kind which
the Servicer reasonably deems to be confidential, the Successor Servicer shall
be required to enter into such customary licensing and confidentiality
agreements as the Servicer shall deem necessary to protect its interest.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance
under Section 10.01(a) for a period of ten Business Days or under Section
10.01(b) or (c) for a period of 60 Business Days shall not constitute a
Service Default if such delay or failure could not be prevented by the
exercise of reasonable diligence by the Servicer and such delay or failure was
caused by an act of God or the public enemy, acts of declared or undeclared
war, public disorder, rebellion or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning,
fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or similar causes. The preceding
sentence shall not relieve the Servicer from using its best efforts to perform
its respective obligations in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Servicer shall provide the Trustee, any Agents, any
Enhancement Providers, the Seller, the Trust and the Noteholders with an
Officers' Certificate giving prompt notice of such failure or delay by it,
together with a description of its efforts so to perform its obligations. The
Servicer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the Seller and the Rating
Agencies in writing of any Service Default.

     SECTION 10.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

          (a) On and after the receipt by the Servicer of a Termination Notice
pursuant to Section 10.01, the Servicer shall continue to perform all
servicing functions under this Agreement until the date specified in the
Termination Notice or otherwise specified by the Trustee in writing or, if no
such date is specified in such Termination Notice, or otherwise specified by
the Trustee, until a date mutually agreed upon by the Servicer and the
Trustee. The Trustee shall as promptly as possible after the giving of a
Termination Notice appoint an Eligible Servicer as a successor servicer (the
"Successor Servicer"), subject to the consent of any Enhancement Providers and
any Agents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and such
Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a
form acceptable to the Trustee. In the event that a Successor Servicer has not
been appointed or has not accepted its appointment at the time when the
Servicer ceases to act as Servicer, the Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer. The Trustee may delegate
any of its servicing obligations to an affiliate or agent in accordance with
Sections 3.01 and 8.07. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee shall, if it is
legally unable so to act, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint any established institution having a net worth of not less than
$100,000,000 and whose regular business includes the servicing of wholesale
receivables as the Successor Servicer hereunder. The Trustee shall immediately
give notice to


                                      62


<PAGE>


the Trust, the Note Rating Agencies, any Enhancement Providers, any Agents and
the Noteholders upon the appointment of a Successor Servicer.

          (b) Upon its appointment, the Successor Servicer shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer with respect to servicing functions
under this Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and
provisions hereof (except that the Successor Servicer shall not be liable for
any liabilities incurred by the predecessor Servicer), and all references in
this Agreement to the Servicer shall be deemed to refer to the Successor
Servicer. Any Successor Servicer, by its acceptance of its appointment, will
automatically agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of any Enhancement
Agreement.

          (c) In connection with any Termination Notice, the Trustee will
review any bids which it obtains from Eligible Servicers and shall be
permitted to appoint any Eligible Servicer submitting such a bid as a
Successor Servicer for servicing compensation not in excess of the Servicing
Fee (provided that if all such bids exceed the Servicing Fee the Seller at its
own expense shall pay when due the amount of any compensation in excess of the
Servicing Fee); provided, however, that the Seller shall be responsible for
payment of the Seller's portion of the Servicing Fee as determined pursuant to
this Agreement and all other amounts in excess of the Aggregate Series
Servicing Fee, and that no such monthly compensation paid out of Collections
shall be in excess of the Aggregate Series Servicing Fee permitted to the
Servicer. The holders of the Seller's Certificates agree that if DCS (or any
Successor Servicer) is terminated as Servicer hereunder, the portion of
Collections to be released to the Trust for distribution in respect of the
Seller's Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement shall be reduced by an
amount sufficient to pay Seller's share of the compensation of the Successor
Servicer.

          (d) All authority and power granted to the Successor Servicer under
this Agreement shall automatically cease and terminate upon termination of the
Trust pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Trust Agreement, and shall pass to and
be vested in the Seller and, without limitation, the Seller is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Successor
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other
instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing rights. The
Successor Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Seller in effecting the
termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Successor Servicer to
conduct servicing on the Receivables. The Successor Servicer shall transfer
its electronic records relating to the Receivables to the Seller in such
electronic form as the Seller may reasonably request and shall transfer all
other records, correspondence and documents to the Seller in the manner and at
such times as the Seller shall reasonably request. To the extent that
compliance with this Section 10.02 shall require the Successor Servicer to
disclose to the Seller information of any kind which the Successor Servicer
deems to be confidential, the Seller shall be required to enter into such
customary licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Successor Servicer
shall deem necessary to protect its interests.

     SECTION 12.01 Termination of Agreement.

          This Agreement and the respective obligations and responsibilities
of the Seller, the Servicer and the Trust shall terminate, except with respect
to the duties described in Sections 7.03 and 8.04, upon the Trust Termination
Date. The Servicer will give the Rating Agencies prompt notice of the
occurrence of the Trust Termination Date.

                                 ARTICLE XIII

                           Miscellaneous Provisions

     SECTION 13.01 Amendment.

          (a) This Agreement may be amended from time to time (including in
connection with the issuance of a Supplemental Certificate pursuant to the
Trust Agreement) by the Servicer, the Seller and the Trust without the consent
of any of the Noteholders; provided that (i) such action shall not, as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel for the Seller, addressed and delivered to
the Trust and the Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Noteholder and (ii) the Trustee shall have received written
confirmation from each Note Rating Agency that such amendment will not have a
Ratings Effect.

          (b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time (including
in connection with the issuance of a Supplemental Certificate pursuant to the
Trust Agreement) by the Servicer, the Seller and the Trust, with the consent
of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 66-2/3% of the aggregate
Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes of all adversely affected
Series or Classes, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders; provided, however, that
no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of or delay the
timing of any distributions to be made to Noteholders or deposits of amounts
to be so distributed or the amount available under any Enhancement Agreement
without the consent of each affected Noteholder, (ii) change the definition of
or the manner of calculating the interest of any Noteholder without the
consent of each affected Noteholder, (iii) reduce the aforesaid percentage
required to consent to any such amendment without the consent of each
Noteholder or (iv) adversely affect the rating of any Series or Class by each
Note Rating Agency without the consent of each affected Noteholder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any amendment to be
effected pursuant to this paragraph (b) without the consent of each adversely
affected Noteholder shall be subject to the Trustee's receipt of written
confirmation from each applicable Note Rating Agency that such amendment will
not have a Ratings Effect with respect to the adversely affected Notes.


                                      64
<PAGE>


Any amendment to be effected pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be deemed to
adversely affect all outstanding Series and Classes, other than any Series or
Class with respect to which such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion
of Counsel for the Seller, addressed and delivered to the Trust and the
Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any
Noteholder of such Series or Class. The Owner Trustee may, but shall not be
obligated to, enter into on behalf of the Trust any such amendment which
affects the Owner Trustee's rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement
or otherwise.

          (c) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent
(other than an amendment pursuant to paragraph (a)), the Servicer shall
furnish notification of the substance of such amendment to the Trustee, each
Rating Agency, each Agent and each Enhancement Provider. Upon its receipt of
any such notice, the Trustee shall promptly forward a copy of such notice to
each Noteholder in accordance with the Indenture.

          (d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders under
this Section 13.01 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment,
but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance
thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders shall be subject to such
reasonable requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.

          (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no
amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Enhancement Provider without the consent
of such Enhancement Provider.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no
amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any holders of the Seller's Certificates
issued by the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement without the consent of the
holders of Seller's Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the
Percentage Interests (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the outstanding
Seller's Certificates.

     SECTION 13.02 Protection of Right, Title and Interest to Trust.

          (a) The Servicer shall cause this Agreement, all amendments hereto
and/or all financing statements and continuation statements and any other
necessary documents covering the Trust's right, title and interest in and to
the Receivables and the Collateral Security to be promptly recorded,
registered and filed, and at all times to be kept recorded, registered and
filed, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law fully
to preserve and protect the right, title and interest of the Trust hereunder.
The Servicer shall deliver to the Trust and the Trustee file-stamped copies
of, or filing receipts for, any document recorded, registered or filed as
provided above, as soon as available following such recording, registration or
filing. The Seller shall cooperate fully with the Servicer in connection with
the obligations set forth above and will execute any and all documents
reasonably required to fulfill the intent of this Section 13.02(a).

          (b) Within 30 days after the Seller or the Servicer makes any change
in its name, identity or corporate structure which would make any financing
statement or continuation


                                      65


<PAGE>


statement filed in accordance with Section 13.02(a) seriously misleading
within the meaning of Section 9-506 of the UCC (including as a result of a
Designated Affiliate Transfer), the Seller shall give the Trust, the Trustee
and any Agent notice of any such change and shall file such financing
statements or amendments as may be necessary to continue the perfection of the
Trust's security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.

          (c) The Seller and the Servicer will give the Trust, the Trustee and
any Agent prompt written notice of any relocation of any office from which it
services Receivables or keeps records concerning the Receivables or of its
principal executive office and whether, as a result of such relocation, the
applicable provisions of the UCC would require the filing of any amendment of
any previously filed financing or continuation statement or of any new
financing statement and shall file such financing statements or amendments as
may be necessary to perfect or to continue the perfection of the Trust's
security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof. The Seller and
the Servicer will at all times maintain each office from which it services
Receivables and its principal executive officer within the United States of
America.

          (d) The Servicer will deliver to the Trust, the Trustee, any Agent
and any Enhancement Provider: (i) upon the execution and delivery of each
amendment of this Agreement, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect specified in
Exhibit G-1; (ii) on each Addition Date on which any Additional Accounts are

                                    FORM OF
               ASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS

                         (As required by Section 2.05
                     of the Sale and Servicing Agreement)


          ASSIGNMENT NO. ___ OF RECEIVABLES IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS dated as of
_______________, _____ (this "Assignment"), among DaimlerChrysler Wholesale
Receivables LLC, as seller (the "Seller"), DaimlerChrysler Services North
America LLC, as servicer (the "Servicer"), and DaimlerChrysler Master Owner
Trust (the "Trust"), pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement referred to
below.

                                  WITNESSETH:

          WHEREAS the Seller, the Servicer and the Trust are parties to a Sale
and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended or
supplemented, the "Agreement");

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, the Seller wishes to designate
Additional Accounts to be included as Accounts and to convey the Receivables
and related Collateral Security of such Additional Accounts, whether now
existing or hereafter created, to the Trust which, in turn, shall grant a
security interest in all such conveyed property to the Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture (as each such term is defined in the Agreement); and

          WHEREAS the Trust is willing to accept such designation and
conveyance subject to the terms and conditions hereof;

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Seller, the Servicer and the Trust hereby agree
as follows:

          1. Defined Terms. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.

          "Addition Date" shall mean, with respect to the Additional Accounts
     designated hereby, _________________, _____.

          "Additional Accounts" shall mean, the Additional Accounts, as
     defined in the Agreement, that are designated hereby and listed on
     Schedule 1 hereto.

          "Additional Cut-Off Date" shall mean, with respect to the Additional
     Accounts designated hereby, ___________, _____.

          2. Designation of Additional Accounts. The Seller hereby delivers
herewith a computer file or microfiche or written list containing a true and
complete list of all such


                                     B-1


<PAGE>


Additional Accounts specifying for each such Account, as of the Additional
Cut-Off Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables
outstanding in such Account and the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables
in such Account. Such file, microfiche or list shall be marked as Schedule 1
to this Assignment and shall, as of the date of this Assignment, be
incorporated into and made a part of this Assignment and shall supplement
Schedule 1 to the Agreement.

          3. Conveyance of Receivables. (a) The Seller does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey, without recourse (except as
expressly provided in the Agreement), to the Trust, all of its right, title
and interest in, to and under the Receivables in such Additional Accounts and
all Collateral Security with respect thereto owned by the Seller and existing
at the close of business on the Additional Cut-Off Date and thereafter created
from time to time until the termination of the Trust, all monies due or to
become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds
(including Recoveries) thereof. The foregoing sale, transfer, assignment,
set-over and conveyance does not constitute, and is not intended to result in
the creation or an assumption by the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee,
any Agent, any Noteholder or any Enhancement Provider of any obligation of the
Servicer, the Seller, DCS, DaimlerChrysler or any other Person in connection
with the Accounts, the Receivables or under any agreement or instrument
relating thereto, including any obligation to any Dealers.

          (b) In connection with such sale, the Seller agrees to record and
file, at its own expense, a financing statement on form UCC-1 (and
continuation statements when applicable) with respect to the Receivables now
existing and hereafter created for the sale of "tangible chattel paper",
"accounts" or "payment intangibles" (each as defined in Section 9-102 of the
UCC as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction) meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect the sale and assignment of the Receivables and the Collateral
Security to the Trust, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing
statements or other evidence of such filing to the Trustee on or prior to the
Addition Date. The Trustee shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file
such financing statement, or a continuation statement to such financing
statement, or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection with such
sales.

          (c) In connection with such sale, the Seller further agrees, at its
own expense, on or prior to the Addition Date, to indicate in its computer
files that the Receivables created in connection with the Additional Accounts
designated hereby have been sold and the Collateral Security assigned to the
Trust pursuant to this Assignment, and pledged by the Trust to the Trustee for
the benefit of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the
Indenture.

          (d) The parties hereto intend that the transfers of Receivables and
related Collateral Security effected by this Assignment be sales.
Nevertheless, if such transfers are deemed to be transfers for security, then
this Assignment also shall be deemed to be and hereby is a security agreement
within the meaning of the UCC, and the conveyance by the Seller provided for
in this Assignment shall also be deemed to be and hereby is a grant by the
Seller to the Trust of a security interest in all of the Seller's right, title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under such
Receivables and related Collateral Security. For tax purposes, the parties
hereto intend that all transfers of Receivables and related Collateral
Security


                                      B-2


<PAGE>


under this Assignment constitute transfers of such Receivables and
related Collateral Security as security for a loan.

          4. Acceptance by the Trust. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6 of this Assignment, the Trust hereby
acknowledges its acceptance of all right, title and interest previously held
by the Seller to the property, now existing and hereafter created, conveyed to
the Trust pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Assignment. The Trust further
acknowledges that, prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Assignment, the Seller delivered to the Trust and the Trustee the
computer file or microfiche or written list relating to the Additional
Accounts described in Section 2 of this Assignment. The Trustee shall be under
no obligation whatsoever to verify the accuracy or completeness of the
information contained in such file or list.

          5. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Trust as of the date of this Assignment and as
of the Addition Date that:

               (a) Legal, Valid and Binding Obligation. This Assignment
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
     enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
     effect affecting creditors' rights in general and except as such
     enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity (whether
     considered in a suit at law or in equity);

               (b) Eligible Accounts. Each Additional Account designated
     hereby is an Eligible Account;

               (c) Selection Procedures. No selection procedures believed by
     the Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust, the
     Noteholders or any Enhancement Providers were utilized in selecting
     the Additional Accounts designated hereby;

               (d) Insolvency. As of the Notice Date and the Addition Date,
     the Seller is not insolvent nor, after giving effect to the
     conveyance set forth in Section 3 of this Assignment, will the
     Seller have been made insolvent, nor is the Seller aware of any
     pending insolvency;

               (e) Valid Transfer. This Assignment constitutes a valid sale,
     transfer and assignment to the Trust of all right, title and
     interest of the Seller in the Receivables and the Collateral
     Security and the proceeds thereof and upon the filing of the
     financing statements described in Section 3 of this Assignment with
     the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and other applicable
     states and, in the case of the Receivables and the Collateral
     Security hereafter created and the proceeds thereof, upon the
     creation thereof, the Trust shall have a first priority perfected
     ownership interest in such property, subject to the rights of the
     Purchased Receivables Owners in any Collateral Security in respect
     of the Partial Accounts (other than the Vehicles relating to
     Principal Receivables arising in the Partial Accounts), except for
     Liens permitted under the Receivables Purchase


                                     B-3


<PAGE>


     Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement and except for
     Liens permitted under the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the other
     Transaction Documents, neither the Seller nor any Person claiming through
     or under the Seller has any claim to or interest in the Collateral of the
     Trust;

               (f) No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Assignment,
     the performance of the transactions contemplated by this Assignment
     and the fulfillment of the terms hereof, will not conflict with,
     result in any breach of any of the material terms and provisions of,
     or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a
     material default under, any indenture, contract, agreement,
     mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to which the Seller is
     a party or by which it or its properties are bound;

               (g) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Assignment
     by the Seller, the performance of the transactions contemplated by
     this Assignment and the fulfillment of the terms hereof applicable
     to the Seller will not conflict with or violate any material
     Requirements of Law applicable to the Seller;

               (h) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or, to the best
     knowledge of the Seller, investigations pending or threatened
     against the Seller before any Governmental Authority (i) asserting
     the invalidity of this Assignment, (ii) seeking to prevent the
     consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
     Assignment, (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that, in the
     reasonable judgment of the Seller, would materially and adversely
     affect the performance by the Seller of its obligations under this
     Assignment, (iv) seeking any determination or ruling that would
     materially and adversely affect the validity or enforceability of
     this Assignment or (v) seeking to affect adversely the income tax
     attributes of the Trust under the United States Federal or any State
     income, single business or franchise tax systems;

               (i) Record of Accounts. As of the Addition Date, Schedule 1 to
     this Assignment is an accurate and complete listing in all material
     respects of all the Additional Accounts as of the Additional Cut-Off
     Date and the information contained therein with respect to the
     identity of such Accounts and the Receivables existing thereunder is
     true and correct in all material respects as of the Additional
     Cut-Off Date;

               (j) No Liens. Each Receivable and all Collateral Security
     existing on the Addition Date has been conveyed to the Trust free
     and clear of any Lien, subject to the rights of the Purchased
     Receivables Owners in any Collateral Security in respect of the
     Partial Accounts (other than the Vehicles relating to Principal
     Receivables arising in the Partial Accounts) and except for Liens
     permitted under the Receivables Purchase Agreement;

               (k) All Consents Required. With respect to each Receivable and
     all Collateral Security existing on the Addition Date, all consents,
     licenses, approvals or authorizations of or registrations or
     declarations with any Governmental Authority required to be
     obtained, effected or given by the Seller in connection with the
     conveyance of such Receivable or Collateral Security to the Trust,

     have been duly obtained, effected or given and are in full force and

     Receivable conveyed to the Trust as of such date is an Eligible
     Receivable or, if such Receivable is not an Eligible Receivable,
     such Receivable is conveyed to the Trust in accordance with Section

             Provisions to be Included in Opinion of Counsel to be
                   Delivered Pursuant to Section 13.02(d)(i)


          (i) The Amendment to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, attached
hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Amendment"), has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Seller and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement
of the Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally from time to time in effect. The enforceability of the Seller's
obligations is also subject to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          (ii) The Amendment has been entered into in accordance with the
terms and provisions of Section 13.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

          (iii) The Amendment will not adversely affect in any material
respect the interests of the Noteholders. [Include this clause (iii) only in
the case of amendments effected pursuant to Section 13.01(a) of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement.]

                                    FORM OF
                              OPINION OF COUNSEL

             Provisions to be Included in Opinion of Counsel to be
            Delivered Pursuant to Section 13.02(d)(ii) and (iii)*


          The opinions set forth below may be subject to all the
qualifications, assumptions, limitations and exceptions taken or made in the
opinion of counsel to DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC (the "Seller")
delivered on any Closing Date. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
are used as defined in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of December
16, 2004 (as amended and supplemented, the "Sale and Servicing Agreement"),
among the Seller, as seller, DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC, as
servicer (the "Servicer"), and DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust (the
"Trust").

          [(a) The Assignment has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Seller, and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms.]

          (b) Assuming the Receivables [in the Additional Accounts] are
created under, and are evidenced solely by, Floorplan Financing Agreements,
such Receivables will constitute "tangible chattel paper", "accounts" or
"payment intangibles" (each as defined under Section 9-102 of the UCC as in
effect in the relevant jurisdiction). We note that DaimlerChrysler Services
North America LLC has given us an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the
Receivables are created under Floorplan Financing Agreements.

          (c) If the transfer of the Receivables [in the Additional Accounts]
and all [of the related] Collateral Security to the Trust pursuant to the Sale
and Servicing Agreement constitutes a true sale of such Receivables and
Collateral Security to the Trust:

               (i) with respect to such Receivables and Collateral Security in
     existence on the date hereof, such sale transfers all of the right,
     title and interest of the Seller in and to such Receivables and
     Collateral Security to the Trust, free and clear of any liens now
     existing or hereafter created, but subject to the rights of the
     Seller as holder of the DCMOT Certificate;

               (ii) with respect to such Receivables and Collateral Security
     which come into existence after the date hereof, upon the creation
     of such Receivables and Collateral Security and the subsequent
     transfer of such Receivables and Collateral Security to the Trust in
     accordance with the Sale and Servicing

<PAGE>


     Agreement and receipt by the Seller of the consideration therefor
     required pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, such sale will
     transfer all of the right, title and interest of the Seller in and to
     such Receivables and Collateral Security to the Trust free and clear of
     any liens, but subject to the rights of the Seller as holder of the DCMOT
     Certificate;

and, in either case, no further action will thereafter be required under
Michigan, Delaware or federal law to protect the Trust's ownership interest in
the Receivables and the Collateral Security against creditors of, or
subsequent purchasers from, the Seller.

          (d) If the transfer of the Receivables and Collateral Security to
the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement does not constitute a
true sale of the Receivables and the Collateral Security to the Trust, then
the Sale and Servicing Agreement as amended and supplemented by the Assignment
creates a valid security interest in favor of the Trust in the Seller's right,
title and interest in and to the Receivables and the Collateral Security and
the proceeds thereof securing the obligations of the Seller thereunder.
Financing statements on form UCC-1 having been filed in the offices of the
Secretaries of State of the States of Michigan and [other applicable states]
and accordingly, such security interest constitutes a perfected security
interest in such Receivables and Collateral Security and the proceeds thereof
subject to no prior liens, enforceable as such against creditors of, and
subsequent purchasers from, the Seller, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to
or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equity principles.

                REASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN REMOVED ACCOUNTS

                         (As required by Section 2.07
                     of the Sale and Servicing Agreement)


          REASSIGNMENT NO. ___ OF RECEIVABLES IN REMOVED ACCOUNTS dated as of
_______________, _____ (this "Reassignment"), by and between DaimlerChrysler
Wholesale Receivables LLC, , a Delaware limited liability company (the
"Seller"), and DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust, Delaware statutory trust
(the "Trust"), pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement referred to below.

                                  WITNESSETH:

          WHEREAS the Seller, DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC, as
servicer (the "Servicer"), and the Trust are parties to a Sale and Servicing
Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as amended or supplemented, the
"Agreement");

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, the Seller wishes to remove all
Receivables from certain Removed Accounts (the "Removed Accounts") and the
Collateral Security thereof and to cause the Trust to reconvey the Receivables
of such Removed Accounts and such Collateral Security, whether now existing or
hereafter created, from the Trust to the Seller (as each such term is defined
in the Agreement); and

          WHEREAS the Trust is willing to accept such designation and to
reconvey the Receivables in the Removed Accounts and such Collateral Security
subject to the terms and conditions hereof;

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Seller and the Trust hereby agree as follows:

          1. Defined Terms. All terms defined in the Agreement and used herein
shall have such defined meanings when used herein, unless otherwise defined
herein.

          "Removal Commencement Date" shall mean, with respect to the Removal
     Accounts designated hereby, ---------------, -----.

          "Removal Date" shall mean, with respect to the Removed Accounts
     designated hereby, _________________, ______.

          "Removed Accounts" shall mean, the Removed Accounts, as defined in
     the Agreement, that are designated hereby and listed on Schedule 1
     hereto.

          2. Designation of Removed Accounts. The Seller shall deliver to the
Trust and the Trustee, any Enhancement Providers and the Rating Agencies a
computer file or


<PAGE>


microfiche or written list containing a true and complete list of the Removed
Accounts, specifying for each such Account, as of the Removal Commencement
Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in
such Accounts and the Designated Balance. Such list shall be marked as
Schedule 1 to this Reassignment and shall be incorporated into and made a part
of this Reassignment as of the Removal Date and shall amend Schedule 1 to the
Agreement.

          3. Conveyance of Receivables and Accounts. (a) The Trust does hereby
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without
recourse, representation or warranty on and after the Removal Date, all right,
title and interest of the Trust in, to and under all Receivables now existing
at the close of business on the Removal Date and thereafter created from time
to time until the termination of the Trust in Removed Accounts designated
hereby, all Collateral Security thereof, all monies due or to become due and
all amounts received with respect thereto (including all Non-Principal
Receivables) and all proceeds (including Recoveries) thereof.

          (b) If requested by the Seller, in connection with such transfer,
the Trust agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to the Seller on or prior to the date of this Reassignment, a
termination statement with respect to the Receivables existing at the close of
business on the Removal Date and thereafter created from time to time and
Collateral Security thereof in the Removed Accounts reassigned hereby (which
may be a single termination statement with respect to all such Receivables and
Collateral Security) evidencing the release by the Trust or by the Trustee, as
applicable, of its lien on the Receivables in the Removed Accounts and the
Collateral Security, and meeting the requirements of applicable state law, in
such manner and such jurisdictions as are necessary to remove such lien.

          4. Acceptance by the Trust. The Trust hereby acknowledges that,
prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Reassignment, the Seller delivered to the Trust and the Trustee the computer
file or such microfiche or written list described in Section 2 of this
Reassignment.

          5. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Trust as of the date of this Reassignment and
as of the Removal Date:

          (a) Legal, Valid and Binding Obligation. This Reassignment
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
     enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
     effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
     except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of
     equity (whether considered in a suit at law or in equity);

          (b) No Early Redemption Event. The removal of the Accounts hereby
     removed shall not, in the reasonable belief of the Seller, cause an Early
     Redemption Event to occur or cause the Pool Balance to be less than the
     Required Participation Amount;


                                     H-2


<PAGE>

          (c) Selection Procedures. No selection procedures believed by the
     Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or
     any Enhancement Providers were utilized in selecting the Designated
     Accounts [and the selection procedures were applied so as to randomly
     select the Designated Account from the entire population of Accounts];
     and

          (d) True and Complete List. The list of Removed Accounts described
     in Section 2 of this Reassignment is, as of the Removal Commencement
     Date, true and complete in all material respects;

provided, however, that in the event that the removal on such Removal Date
relates solely to Ineligible Accounts, the Seller shall be deemed to make only
the representations and warranties contained in paragraph 5(a) above.

          6. Conditions Precedent. In addition to the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 2.07 of the Agreement, the obligation of the Trust to execute
and deliver this Reassignment is subject to the satisfaction, on or prior to
the Removal Commencement Date, of the following additional condition
precedent:

               Officers' Certificate. The Seller shall have delivered to the
     Trust and the Trustee an Officers' Certificate certifying that (i) as of
     the Removal Commencement Date, all requirements set forth in Section 2.07
     of the Agreement for designating Removed Accounts and reconveying the
     Receivables of such Removed Accounts and the Collateral Security, whether
     existing at the close of business on the Removal Date or thereafter
     created from time to time until the termination of the Trust, have been
     satisfied, and (ii) each of the representations and warranties made by
     the Seller in Section 5 hereof is true and correct as of the date of this
     Reassignment and as of the Removal Commencement Date. The Trustee may
     conclusively rely on such Officers' Certificate, shall have no duty to
     make inquiries with regard to the matters set forth therein and shall
     incur no liability in so relying.

          7. Ratification of Agreement. As supplemented by this Reassignment,
the Agreement is in all respects ratified and confirmed and the Agreement as
so supplemented by this Reassignment shall be read, taken and construed as one
and the same instrument.

                  8. Counterparts. This Reassignment may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of
which shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

          9. GOVERNING LAW. THIS REASSIGNMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF
LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL
BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

          10. Limitation on Liability of the Owner Trustee and Trustee. (a)

any beneficial owner of the Trust have any liability for the representations,

hereto, as to all of which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the
Trust. For all purposes of this Reassignment, in the performance of its duties
or obligations hereunder or in the performance of any duties or obligations of
the Trust hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be subject to, and entitled to
the benefits of, the terms and provisions of Articles V, VI and XI of the
Trust Agreement.

Reassignment has been accepted by The Bank of New York, not in its individual
capacity but solely as Trustee and in no event shall The Bank of New York have
any liability for the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
other obligations of the Trust hereunder or in any of the certificates,

                               SUBORDINATED NOTE

                                                            New York, New York
                                                             December 16, 2004


          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, DaimlerChrysler Wholesale
Receivables LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), hereby
unconditionally promises to pay to the order of DaimlerChrysler Services North
America LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("DCS"), in lawful money of
the United States of America in immediately available funds the principal
amount outstanding on December 16, 2024 (the "Maturity Date"), in respect of
monies borrowed by the Company from time to time to fund the purchase of
Receivables by the Company from DCS pursuant to the Second Amended and
Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Receivables Purchase
Agreement"), between the Company and DCS. The Company may, at its option,
prepay this Subordinated Note in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time from and after the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall
the holder hereof have any right to demand any payment of principal hereunder
prior to the Maturity Date.

          Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the
meanings assigned to them in the Sale and Servicing Agreement dated as of
December 16, 2004 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Sale and
Servicing Agreement"), among the Company, as seller, DCS, as servicer, and
DaimlerChrysler Master Owner Trust (the "Issuer").

          The undersigned further agrees to pay interest in like money on the
unpaid principal amount hereof from time to time from the date hereof at a
rate per annum equal to [___________________________]. Interest shall be
payable in arrears on each Payment Date commencing on the first such date to
occur after the date hereof and upon final payment of the unpaid principal
amount hereof.

          This Subordinated Note is subordinate and junior in right and time
of payment to all "Senior Debt" of the Company, which is any Indebtedness of
the Company and all renewals, extensions, refinancings and refundings thereof,
except any such Indebtedness that expressly provides that it is not senior or
superior in right of payment hereto. "Indebtedness" is any indebtedness,
whether or not contingent, in respect of borrowed money or evidenced by bonds,
notes, debentures or similar instruments or letters of credit (or
reimbursement agreements in respect thereto) whether any such indebtedness
would appear as a liability upon a balance sheet of the Company prepared on a
consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

          All scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of
Senior Debt must be paid before this Subordinated Note shall be payable, and
all scheduled payments of principal and interest on this Subordinated Note
shall be payable only to the extent that the Company, after


                                     J-1



<PAGE>


paying all of its accounts payable and other current expenses, has the funds
to make such payments. The Company agrees, and the holder hereof by accepting
this Subordinated Note agrees, to the subordination provisions herein
contained. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the
obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be recourse to the Issuer or
any assets thereof pledged under the Amended and Restated Indenture dated as
of December 16, 2004, between the Issuer and The Bank of New York, as
indenture trustee.

          The holder of this Subordinated Note, by its acceptance hereof,
hereby covenants and agrees that it will not at any time institute against the
Company or the Issuer any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency
or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States
federal or state bankruptcy or similar law.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Subordinated Note to
be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

                          Form of Opinion of Counsel

          DCWR has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited
liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
with full power and authority (limited liability company and other) to own its

existing as a [_______] in good standing under the laws of the State of

under the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and to assume and to perform the
obligations of DCWR under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Related
Documents and the Trust Documents.

          The Designated Affiliate is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing, and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals, in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to qualify or to obtain such licenses or
approvals would render any Receivable unenforceable by the Designated
Affiliate, the Trust or the Trustee on behalf of any Noteholder or other
Secured Party.

          The Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by DCWR, and is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of DCWR enforceable against DCWR in accordance with its terms, except (y) the
enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights, and (z) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

          The Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Designated Affiliate, and the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Related Documents
and the Trust Documents are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Designated Affiliate. The Assignment and Assumption Agreement is enforceable
against the Designated Affiliate in accordance with its terms, except (y) the
enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights, and (z) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

          Neither the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance by DCWR of
DCWR's right, title and interest in the Collateral, the Seller's Interest, the
DCMOT Certificate, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Related Documents and
the Trust Documents or its obligations as


                                     K-5


<PAGE>


Seller thereunder to the Designated Affiliate, nor the consummation of any
other transaction contemplated in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, nor
the execution and delivery of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement by DCWR,
will conflict with, or result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or
constitute a default under, any term or provision of the limited liability
company agreement of DCWR or DCS, or of any indenture or other agreement or
instrument to which DCWR or DCS is a party or by which any of them is bound,
or result in a violation of, or contravene the terms of any statute, order or
regulation applicable to DCWR or DCS of any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over any of
them.

          Neither the execution and delivery of the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement by the Designated Affiliate, nor the assumption of the obligations
of DCWR as Seller under the Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Related Documents or the Trust Documents, nor the consummation
of any other transaction contemplated in the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the Amended and Restated
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Related Documents or the Trust Documents
by the Designated Affiliate, will conflict with, or result in a breach,
violation or acceleration of, or constitute a default under, any term or
provision of the [constituent documents] of the Designated Affiliate, or of
any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Designated
Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound, or result in a violation of, or
contravene the terms of any statute, order or regulation applicable to the
Designated Affiliate of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
governmental body having jurisdiction over it.

          There are no actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to
the best of such counsel's knowledge after due inquiry, threatened before any
court, administrative agency, or other tribunal (1) asserting the invalidity
of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (2) seeking to prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement or the execution and delivery thereof, or (3) that might
materially and adversely affect the performance by DCWR or the Designated
Affiliate of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Related Documents or the Trust Documents.

          No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or notice to or
filing with, any court or governmental agency or body is required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, except the filing of amendments to UCC financing statements to
reflect the change of the "Seller" described in such financing statements to
the Designated Affiliate.

                  (ii) The Administrator will:

                        (A) pay the Indenture Trustee from time to time
      reasonable compensation for all services rendered by the Indenture
      Trustee under the Indenture (which compensation shall not be limited by

      themselves against any claim or liability (whether asserted by the
      Issuer, the Servicer, any Holder or any other Person) in connection with
      the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties under the
      Indenture; and

                        (D) indemnify the Owner Trustee and its agents for,

      Agreements, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending
      themselves against any claim or liability in connection with the
      exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties under the Trust
      Agreement or any Related Agreement.

      The provisions of paragraphs (A) through (C) above will survive the
      termination of this Agreement, the Indenture and the resignation or
      removal of the Indenture Trustee under Section 810 of the Indenture, and
      the provisions of paragraph (D) above will survive the termination of

      and the Person to or on behalf of whom such payments are made thereafter
      collects any such amount from others, such Person will promptly repay
      such amounts to the Administrator.

            (b) Additional Duties.

                  (i) In addition to the duties of the Administrator set forth
      above, the Administrator shall perform such calculations and shall
      prepare or shall cause the preparation by other appropriate persons of,
      and shall execute on behalf of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee, all such
      documents, reports, filings, instruments, certificates and opinions that
      it shall be the duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to prepare, file
      or deliver pursuant to the Related Agreements, and at the request of the
      Owner Trustee shall



                                      6
<PAGE>

      take all appropriate action that it is the duty of the Issuer or the
      Owner Trustee to take pursuant to the Related Agreements. In furtherance
      thereof, the Owner Trustee shall, on behalf of itself and of the Issuer,
      execute and deliver to the Administrator and to each successor
      Administrator appointed pursuant to the terms hereof, one or more powers
      of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, appointing
      the Administrator the attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee and the
      Issuer for the purpose of executing on behalf of the Owner Trustee and
      the Issuer all such documents, reports, filings, instruments,
      certificates and opinions. Subject to Section 5 of this Agreement, and
      in accordance with the directions of the Owner Trustee, the
      Administrator shall administer, perform or supervise the performance of
      such other activities in connection with the Collateral (including the
      Related Agreements) as are not covered by any of the foregoing
      provisions and as are expressly requested by the Owner Trustee and are
      reasonably within the capability of the Administrator.

                  (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
      Related Agreements to the contrary, the Administrator shall be
      responsible for promptly notifying the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
      Paying Agent (as defined in the Trust Agreement) in the event that any
      withholding tax is imposed on the Issuer's payments (or allocations of
      income) to the Beneficiary or any other holder of a Seller's Certificate
      as contemplated in Section 4.01(b) of the Trust Agreement. Any such
      notice shall specify the amount of any withholding tax required to be
      withheld by the Certificate Paying Agent pursuant to such provision. The
      Administrator shall perform all other duties expressly required to be
      performed by the Administrator under the Trust Agreement.

                  (iii) In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its
      other obligations under this Agreement, the Administrator may enter into
      transactions or otherwise deal with any of its affiliates; provided,
      however, that the terms of any such transactions or dealings shall be in
      accordance with any directions received from the Issuer and shall be, in
      the Administrator's opinion, no less favorable to the Issuer than would
      be available from unaffiliated parties.

            (c) Non-Ministerial Matters.

                  (i) With respect to matters that in the reasonable judgment
      of the Administrator are non-ministerial, the Administrator shall not
      take any action unless within a reasonable time before the taking of
      such action, the Administrator shall have notified the Owner Trustee of
      the proposed action and the Owner Trustee shall not have withheld
      consent or provided an alternative direction. For the purpose of the
      preceding sentence, "non-ministerial matters" shall include, without
      limitation:

                        (A) the amendment of or any supplement to the
      Indenture;

                        (B) the initiation of any claim or lawsuit by the
      Issuer and the compromise of any action, claim or lawsuit brought by or

      Receivables);

                  (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
      Agreement, the Administrator shall not be obligated to, and shall not,
      (x) make any payments to the Noteholders under the Related Agreements,
      (y) sell the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture or (z) take any other
      action that the Issuer directs the Administrator not to take on its
      behalf.

      2. Records. The Administrator shall maintain appropriate books of

      4. Additional Information to Be Furnished to Issuer. The Administrator
shall furnish to the Issuer from time to time such additional information

the Administrator shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject

manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder.
Unless expressly authorized by the Issuer, the Administrator shall have no
authority to act for or represent the Issuer or the Owner Trustee in any way
and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee.

      6. No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall
constitute the Administrator and either of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee as
members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate,
unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to
impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer
on any of them any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any

Administrator or its Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its
sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity as an administrator for any
other person or entity even though such

the immediately preceding sentence, any amendment to be effected pursuant to
such sentence without the consent of each adversely affected Noteholder shall
be subject to the Indenture Trustee's receipt of written confirmation from
each applicable Note Rating Agency that such amendment will not have a Ratings
Effect with respect to the adversely affected Notes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrator may not amend this Agreement without the written
consent of the Beneficiary, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      12. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by the
Administrator unless such assignment is previously consented to in writing by
the Issuer and the Owner Trustee and subject to receipt of a confirmation from
each Note Rating Agency that such assignment will not cause a reduction,
qualification or withdrawal of any then current rating of any Notes. An
assignment with such consent and confirmation, if accepted by the assignee,
shall bind the assignee hereunder in the same manner as the Administrator is
bound hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be assigned
by the Administrator without the consent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to
a corporation or other organization that is a successor (by merger,
consolidation or purchase of assets) to the Administrator; provided that such
successor organization executes and delivers to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee an agreement in which such corporation or other
organization agrees to be bound hereunder by the terms of said assignment in
the same manner as the Administrator is bound hereunder. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall bind any successors or assigns of the parties
hereto.

      13. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT

meaning, construction or effect of this Agreement.

      15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which when so executed shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

      16. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

      17. Not Applicable to DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC in
Other Capacities. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any obligation
DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC may have in any other capacity.

of the certificates, notices or agreements delivered pursuant hereto, as to
all of which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the Issuer.

beneficiary to this Agreement and is entitled to the rights and benefits
hereunder and may enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto.

third paragraph of Section 2.01.

          SECTION 1.02. Other Definitional Provisions.

          The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article, section,
subsection, schedule and exhibit references are to this Agreement unless

                                  ARTICLE II

                           CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES

          SECTION 2.01. Conveyance of Receivables.

          By execution of this Agreement, the Seller does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey, without recourse (except as
expressly provided herein), to the Buyer on the first Closing Date, in the
case of Initial Accounts, and on the applicable Addition Date, in the case of
Additional Accounts, all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the
Receivables in each Account and all Collateral Security with respect thereto
owned by the Seller at the close of business on the Cut-Off Date, in the case
of the Initial Accounts, and on the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, in the
case of Additional Accounts, and all monies due or to become due and all
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds (including Recoveries)
thereof. Subject to Article VI, as of each Business Day prior to the earlier

Servicer, the Buyer or DaimlerChrysler and (y) the Trust Termination Date, on
which Receivables are created in the Accounts (a "Transfer Date"), the Seller
does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey, without
recourse (except as expressly provided herein), to the Buyer, all of its
right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables in each Account
(other than any Receivables created in any Designated Account from and after
the applicable Removal Commencement Date) and all Collateral Security with
respect thereto owned by the Seller at the close of business on such Transfer
Date and not theretofore conveyed to the Buyer, all monies due or to become
due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds (including
Recoveries) thereof. The foregoing sale, transfer, assignment, set-over and
conveyance and any subsequent sales, transfers, assignments, set-overs and
conveyances do not constitute, and are not intended to result in, the creation
or an assumption by the Buyer of any obligation of the Servicer, the Seller,
DaimlerChrysler or any other Person in connection with the Accounts, the
Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto, including
any obligation to any Dealers.

          In connection with such sales, the Seller agrees to record and file,
at its own expense, a financing statement on form UCC-1 (and continuation
statements when applicable) naming the Seller as "seller" and the Buyer as
"buyer" thereon with respect to the Receivables now existing and hereafter
created for the sale of "tangible chattel paper", "accounts" or "payment
intangibles" (each as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC as in effect in the
relevant jurisdiction) meeting the requirements of applicable state law in
such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary to perfect the sale and
assignment of the Receivables and the


                                      3
<PAGE>


Collateral Security to the Buyer, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such
financing statements or other evidence of such filing to the Buyer on or prior
to the first Closing Date, in the case of Initial Accounts, and (if any
additional filing is so necessary) the applicable Addition Date, in the case
of Additional Accounts. In addition, the Seller shall cause to be timely filed
in the appropriate filing office any UCC-1 financing statement and
continuation statement necessary to perfect any sale of Receivables to the
Seller. The Buyer shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file such
financing statement, or a continuation statement to such financing statement,
or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection with such sales.

          In connection with such sales, the Seller further agrees, at its own
expense, on or prior to the first Closing Date, in the case of Initial
Accounts, the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Additional Accounts,
and the applicable Removal Commencement Date, in the case of Removed Accounts,
(a) to indicate in its computer files that the Receivables created in
connection with the Accounts (other than Removed Accounts) have been sold, and
the Collateral Security assigned, to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and
that, from and after the Effective Date, such Receivables and the related
Collateral Security (including the outstanding Receivables and related
Collateral Security created in connection with the Existing Accounts
previously sold by the Buyer to the CARCO Trust pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement) have been sold to the Trust pursuant to the Program
Amendment Agreement and the Sale and Servicing Agreement and pledged by the
Trust to the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and the other Secured
Parties pursuant to the Indenture and (b) to deliver to the Buyer a computer
file or microfiche or written list containing a true and complete list of all
such Accounts (other than Removed Accounts) specifying for each such Account,
as of the Cut-Off Date, in the case of Initial Accounts, and the applicable
Additional Cut-Off Date, in the case of Additional Accounts, (i) its account
number, (ii) the aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account
and (iii) the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in such Account. Such
file, microfiche or list, as amended and/or supplemented from time to time to
reflect Additional Accounts and Removed Accounts, shall be marked as Schedule
1 to this Agreement and is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this
Agreement. The Seller also agrees, at its own expense, to deliver to the Buyer
an updated Schedule 1 to this Agreement (the "Schedule of Existing Accounts")
specifying, as of the Effective Cut-Off Date, for each Existing Account (1)
its account number, (2) the aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in
such Existing Account and (3) the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in
such Existing Account.

          In consideration for the sale of Receivables, together with the
related Collateral Security, sold to the Buyer on the first Closing Date, the
Buyer shall pay to the Seller $495,855,802.38 in cash. Subject to Article VI,
the purchase price for the Receivables sold by the Seller to the Buyer on each
Addition Date and on each Transfer Date thereafter shall be a price agreed to
by the Buyer and the Seller at the time of acquisition by the Buyer, which
price shall not, in the opinion of the Buyer, be materially less favorable to
the Buyer than prices for transactions of a generally similar character at the
time of the acquisition taking into account the quality of such Receivables
and other pertinent factors; provided that such consideration shall in any
event not be less than reasonably equivalent value therefor.

          The parties hereto intend that the transfers of Receivables and
related Collateral Security effected by this Agreement be sales. Nevertheless,
if such transfers are deemed to be



                                      4
<PAGE>


transfers for security, then this Agreement also shall be deemed to be and
hereby is a security agreement within the meaning of the UCC, and the
conveyance by the Seller provided for in this Agreement shall also be deemed
to be and hereby is a grant by the Seller to the Buyer of a security interest
in all of the Seller's right, title and interest, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, in, to and under such Receivables and related Collateral
Security.

          SECTION 2.02. Representations and Warranties of the Seller Relating
to the Seller and the Agreement.

          The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer as of each
Closing Date and the Effective Date that:

          (a) Organization and Good Standing. The Seller is a limited
     liability company duly organized and validly existing and in good
     standing under the law of the State of Michigan and has, in all material
     respects, full power, authority and legal right to own its properties and
     conduct its business as such properties are presently owned and such
     business is presently conducted, and to execute, deliver and perform its
     obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) Due Qualification. The Seller is duly qualified to do business
     and, where necessary, is in good standing as a foreign company (or is
     exempt from such requirement) and has obtained all necessary licenses and
     approvals in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business
     requires such qualification except where the failure to so qualify or
     obtain licenses or approvals would not have a material adverse effect on
     its ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

          (c) Due Authorization. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
     and the consummation of the transactions provided for or contemplated by
     this Agreement have been duly authorized by the Seller by all necessary
     corporate action on the part of the Seller.

          (d) No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
     performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
     fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof, will not conflict with,
     result in any breach of any of the material terms and provisions of, or
     constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a material
     default under, any indenture, contract, agreement, mortgage, deed of
     trust, or other instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which it
     or its properties are bound.

          (e) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
     performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
     fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof applicable to the Seller,
     will not conflict with or violate any material Requirements of Law
     applicable to the Seller.

          (f) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or, to the best
     knowledge of the Seller, investigations, pending or threatened against
     the Seller, before any Governmental Authority (i) asserting the
     invalidity of this Agreement, (ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of
     any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,


                                      5
<PAGE>



     (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that, in the reasonable
     judgment of the Seller, would materially and adversely affect the
     performance by the Seller of its obligations under this Agreement, (iv)
     seeking any determination or ruling that would materially and adversely
     affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or (v) seeking to
     affect adversely the income tax attributes of the Trust (or the CARCO
     Trust, as applicable) under the United States Federal or any State
     income, single business or franchise tax systems.

          (g) All Consents Required. All appraisals, authorizations, consents,
     orders, approvals or other actions of any Person or of any governmental
     body or official required in connection with the execution and delivery
     of this Agreement, the performance of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement, and the fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof, have
     been obtained.

          (h) Enforceability. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
     binding obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in
     accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
     by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
     similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of
     creditors' rights in general and except as such enforceability may be
     limited by general principles of equity (whether considered in a suit at
     law or in equity).

          (i) Record of Accounts. As of the first Closing Date, in the case of
     Initial Accounts and, as of the applicable Addition Date, in the case of
     the Additional Accounts, Schedule 1 to this Agreement is an accurate and
     complete listing in all material respects of all the Accounts as of the
     Cut-Off Date or the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date, as the case may
     be, and the information contained therein with respect to the identity of
     such Accounts and the Receivables existing thereunder is true and correct
     in all material respects as of the Cut-Off Date or such applicable
     Additional Cut-Off Date, as the case may be. As of the Effective Date,
     the Schedule of Existing Accounts delivered by the Seller pursuant to the
     fourth paragraph of Section 2.01 is an accurate and complete listing in
     all material respects of all the Existing Accounts as of the Effective
     Cut-Off Date and the information contained therein with respect to the
     identity of the Existing Accounts and the Receivables existing thereunder
     is true and correct in all material respects as of the Effective Cut-Off
     Date.

          (j) Valid Transfer. This Agreement or, in the case of Additional
     Accounts, the related Assignment constitutes a valid sale, transfer and
     assignment to the Buyer of all right, title and interest of the Seller in
     the Receivables and the Collateral Security and the proceeds thereof.
     Upon the filing of the financing statements described in Section 2.01
     with the Secretary of State of the State of Michigan and, in the case of
     the Receivables hereafter created and the proceeds thereof, upon the
     creation thereof, the Buyer shall have a first priority perfected
     ownership interest in such property, subject to the rights of the
     Purchasers in any Collateral Security in respect of the Partial Accounts
     (other than the Vehicles relating to Principal Receivables arising in the
     Partial Accounts). Except for Liens permitted hereunder and under the
     Sale and Servicing Agreement (or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as
     applicable), neither the Seller nor any Person


                                      6
<PAGE>

     claiming through or under the Seller has any claim to or interest in the
     Collateral of the Trust (or the assets of the CARCO Trust, as
     applicable).

          The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.02
shall survive the transfer and assignment of the Receivables to the Buyer.
Upon discovery by the Seller or the Buyer of a breach of any of the foregoing
representations and warranties, the party discovering such breach shall give
prompt written notice to the other party.

          In the event of any breach of any of the representations and
warranties set forth in this Section 2.02 and if, in connection therewith, the
Buyer shall be obligated to purchase the Noteholders' Interest pursuant to
Section 2.03 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Seller shall repurchase
the Receivables and the Collateral Security and shall pay to the Buyer on the
Business Day preceding the Payment Date on which such purchase of the
Noteholders' Interest is to be made an amount equal to the purchase price for
the Noteholders' Interest as specified in the Sale and Servicing Agreement.
The obligation of the Seller to purchase the Receivables pursuant to this
Section 2.02 shall constitute the sole remedy against the Seller respecting an
event of the type specified in the first sentence of this paragraph available
to the Buyer and to the Noteholders (or the Trustee on behalf of the
Noteholders).

          SECTION 2.03. Representations and Warranties of the Seller Relating
to the Receivables.

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Buyer that:

              (i) Each Receivable and all Collateral Security existing on the
     first Closing Date or, in the case of Additional Accounts, on the
     applicable Addition Date, and on each Transfer Date, has been conveyed to
     the Buyer free and clear of any Lien, subject to the rights of the
     Purchasers in any Collateral Security in respect of the Partial Accounts
     (other than the Vehicles relating to the Principal Receivables arising in
     the Partial Accounts) and except for Liens permitted hereunder and under
     the Sale and Servicing Agreement (or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
     as applicable). Each outstanding Receivable and all Collateral Security
     existing on the Effective Date under the Existing Accounts has been
     conveyed to the Buyer on or before the Effective Date free and clear of
     any Lien, subject to the rights of the Purchasers in any Collateral
     Security in respect of the Partial Accounts (other than the Vehicles
     relating to the Principal Receivables arising in the Partial Accounts)
     and except for Liens permitted hereunder and under the Sale and Servicing
     Agreement (or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as applicable).

              (ii) With respect to each Receivable and all Collateral Security
     existing on the first Closing Date or, in the case of Additional
     Accounts, on the applicable Addition Date, and on each Transfer Date, all
     consents, licenses, approvals or authorizations of or registrations or
     declarations with any Governmental Authority required to be obtained,
     effected or given by the Seller in connection with the conveyance of such
     Receivable or Collateral Security to the Buyer have been duly obtained,
     effected or given and are in full force and effect. With respect to each
     outstanding Receivable and all Collateral Security existing on the
     Effective Date, all consents, licenses, approvals or



                                      7
<PAGE>

     authorizations of or registrations or declarations with any Governmental
     Authority required to be obtained, effected or given by the Seller in
     connection with the conveyance of such Receivable or Collateral Security
     to the Buyer have been duly obtained, effected or given and are in full
     force and effect.

              (iii) On the Cut-Off Date and each Closing Date, each Initial
     Account is an Eligible Account and, in the case of Additional Accounts,
     on the applicable Additional Cut-Off Date and each subsequent Closing
     Date, each such Additional Account is an Eligible Account. On the
     Effective Cut-Off Date, the Effective Date and each subsequent Closing
     Date, each Existing Account is an Eligible Account.

              (iv) On the first Closing Date, in the case of the Initial
     Accounts, and, in the case of the Additional Accounts, on the applicable
     Additional Cut-Off Date, and on each Transfer Date, each Receivable
     conveyed to the Buyer on such date is an Eligible Receivable or, if such
     Receivable is not an Eligible Receivable, such Receivable is conveyed to
     the Buyer in accordance with Section 2.08. On the Effective Date, each
     outstanding Receivable under the Existing Accounts conveyed to the Buyer
     on or before the Effective Date is an Eligible Receivable as of the
     Effective Cut-Off Date or, if later, the applicable Transfer Date or, if
     such Receivable is not an Eligible Receivable, such Receivable was
     conveyed to the Buyer in accordance with Section 2.08.

          (b) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 2.03 shall survive the transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Buyer. Upon discovery by the Seller or the Buyer of a
breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this Section
2.03, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to
the other party.

          (c) Repurchase. In the event any representation or warranty under
Section 2.03(a) is not true and correct as of the date specified therein with
respect to any Receivable or Account and the Buyer is, in connection
therewith, required to purchase such Receivable or all Receivables in such
Account pursuant to Section 2.04(c) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, then,
within 30 days (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Buyer) of the
earlier to occur of the discovery of any such event by the Seller or the
Buyer, or receipt by the Seller or the Buyer of written notice of any such
event given by the Trustee or any Enhancement Providers, the Seller shall
repurchase the Receivable or Receivables of which the Buyer is required to
accept reassignment pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement on the
Business Day preceding the Determination Date on which such reassignment is to
occur.

          The Seller shall purchase each such Receivable by making a payment
to the Buyer in immediately available funds on the Business Day preceding the
Determination Date on which such reassignment is to occur in an amount equal
to the Purchase Price for such Receivable. Upon payment of the Purchase Price,
the Buyer shall automatically and without further action be deemed to sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without
recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the
Buyer in and to such Receivable, all Collateral Security and all monies due or
to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof. The Buyer shall
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall reasonably be requested by the Seller to effect the



                                      8
<PAGE>


conveyance of such Receivables pursuant to this Section 2.03. The obligation
of the Seller to repurchase any such Receivable shall constitute the sole
remedy respecting the event giving rise to such obligation available to the
Buyer, the Trust and to the Noteholders (or the Trustee on behalf of
Noteholders).

          SECTION 2.04. Addition of Accounts.

          (a) The Seller may from time to time offer to voluntarily designate
additional Eligible Accounts (including Partial Accounts) to be included as
Accounts ("Additional Accounts"), subject to the conditions specified in
paragraph (b) below. If any such offer is accepted by the Buyer, Receivables
and Collateral Security from such Additional Accounts shall be sold to the
Buyer effective on a date (the "Addition Date") specified in a written notice
provided by the Seller (or the Servicer on its behalf) to the Buyer and any
Enhancement Providers specifying the Additional Cut-Off Date and the Addition
Date for such Additional Accounts (the "Addition Notice") on or before the
fifth Business Day but not more than 30th day prior to the related Addition
Date (the "Notice Date"). The Addition Notice shall also specify whether such
Additional Accounts are Partial Accounts.

          (b) The Seller shall be permitted to convey to the Buyer the
Receivables and all Collateral Security related thereto in any Additional
Accounts designated by the Seller as such pursuant to Section 2.04(a) only
upon satisfaction of each of the following conditions on or prior to the
related Addition Date:

              (i) The Seller shall provide the Buyer and any Enhancement
     Providers with a timely Addition Notice.

              (ii) Such Additional Accounts shall all be Eligible Accounts.

              (iii) The Seller shall have delivered to the Buyer a duly
     executed written assignment (including an acceptance by the Buyer) in
     substantially the form of Exhibit A (the "Assignment") and the computer
     file microfiche or written list required to be delivered pursuant to
     Section 2.01.

              (iv) The Seller shall have delivered to the Buyer for deposit in
     the Collection Account all Collections with respect to such Additional
     Accounts since the Additional Cut-Off Date.

              (v) (A) No selection procedures believed by the Seller to be
     adverse to the interests of the Buyer, the Trust or the Secured Parties
     were used in selecting such Additional Accounts; (B) the list of
     Additional Accounts delivered pursuant to clause (iii) above is true and
     correct in all material respects as of the Additional Cut-Off Date and
     (C) as of each of the Notice Date and the Addition Date, neither the
     Seller, the Buyer nor the Servicer are insolvent nor will have been made
     insolvent by such transfer nor are aware of any pending insolvency.

              (vi) The Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied.


                                      9
<PAGE>


              (vii) The addition of the Receivables arising in such Additional
     Accounts shall not result in the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event.

              (viii) The Seller shall have delivered to the Buyer and any
     Enhancement Providers a certificate of a Vice President or more senior
     officer confirming the items set forth in paragraphs (ii) through (vii)
     above.

              (ix) On or before each Addition Date, the Seller shall deliver to
     the Buyer and any Enhancement Providers an opinion of counsel with

     the form of Exhibit B.

          (c) The Seller hereby represents and warrants as of the applicable
Addition Date as to the matters set forth in Section 2.04(b)(v). The
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.04(b)(v) shall survive
the sale and assignment of the respective Receivables and Collateral Security
to the Buyer. Upon discovery by the Seller or the Buyer of a breach of any of
the foregoing representations and warranties, the party discovering the breach
shall give prompt written notice to the other party and to any Enhancement
Providers.

          (d) At least 20 days prior to each Addition Date in respect of the
designation of any Additional Accounts pursuant to this Section 2.04, the
Seller shall have given written notice of such designation to the Rating
Agencies.

          The Seller and the Buyer each hereby ratifies, confirms and adopts
each Assignment that was executed and delivered under the Existing Agreement
prior to the Effective Date.

          SECTION 2.05. Covenants of the Seller.

          The Seller hereby covenants that:

          (a) No Liens. Except for the conveyances hereunder, the Seller will
not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant, create,
incur, assume or (subject to the rights of the Purchasers with respect to the
Collateral Security arising in the Partial Accounts (other than the Vehicles
relating to any Principal Receivables) and except as permitted under Section
2.09 hereof and under the Sale and Servicing Agreement) suffer to exist any
Lien on, any Receivable or any Collateral Security, whether now existing or
hereafter created, or any interest therein, and the Seller shall defend the
right, title and interest of the Buyer and the Trust in, to and under the
Receivables and the Collateral Security, whether now existing or hereafter
created, against all claims of third parties claiming through or under the
Seller.

          (b) Floorplan Financing Agreements and Guidelines. The Seller shall
comply with and perform its servicing obligations with respect to the Accounts
and Receivables in accordance with the Floorplan Financing Agreements relating
to the Accounts and the Floorplan Financing Guidelines, except insofar as any
failure to so comply or perform would not materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Trust or any of the Secured Parties. Subject to compliance with
all Requirements of Law, the Seller may change the terms and provisions of the
Floorplan Financing Agreement or the Floorplan Financing Guidelines in any
respect (including the calculation of the amount or the timing of charge-offs
and the rate of the finance charge assessed


                                      10
<PAGE>


thereon) only if such change would be permitted pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

          (c) Account Allocations. In the event that the Seller is unable for
any reason to transfer Receivables to the Buyer then the Seller agrees that it
shall allocate, after the occurrence of such event, payments on each Account
with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the oldest
principal balance of such Account and to have such payments applied as
Collections in accordance with the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement;
provided, however, that in the case of Partial Accounts Collections of
Principal Receivables shall be allocated to the Principal Receivables to which
such Collections relate. The parties hereto agree that Non-Principal
Receivables, whenever created, accrued in respect of Principal Receivables
which have been conveyed to the Buyer and by the Buyer to the Trust shall
continue to be a part of the Trust notwithstanding any cessation of the
transfer of additional Principal Receivables to the Buyer and Collections with
respect thereto shall continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with
Article IV of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

          (d) Delivery of Collections. In the event that the Seller receives
Collections, the Seller agrees to pay the Servicer or any Successor Servicer
all payments received by the Seller in respect of the Receivables as soon as
practicable after receipt thereof by the Seller, but in no event later than
two days after the receipt by the Seller thereof.

          (e) Notice of Liens. The Seller shall notify the Buyer and the
Trustee promptly after becoming aware of any Lien on any Receivable other than
the conveyances hereunder or under the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

          (f) Compliance with Law. The Seller hereby agrees to comply in all
material respects with all Requirements of Law applicable to the Seller.

          SECTION 2.06. Removal of Eligible Accounts.

          (a) On each Determination Date on which Accounts are removed from
the Trust pursuant to Section 2.07 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Buyer shall be deemed to have offered to the Seller automatically and without
notice to or action by or on behalf of the Buyer, the right to remove Eligible
Accounts from the operation of this Agreement in the manner prescribed in
Section 2.06(b).

          (b) To accept such offer and remove Accounts, the Seller (or the
Servicer on its behalf) shall take the following actions and make the
following determinations:

              (i) not less than five Business Days prior to the Removal
     Commencement Date, furnish to the Buyer, the Trustee, any Enhancement
     Providers and the Rating Agencies a written notice (the "Removal Notice")
     specifying the Determination Date (which may be the Determination Date on
     which such notice is given) on which removal of the Receivables of one or
     more Accounts will commence (a "Removal Commencement Date") and the
     Accounts the future generated Receivables of which are to be removed from
     the Trust and retransferred (the "Designated Accounts");


                                      11
<PAGE>


              (ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with respect to
     such Designated Accounts the aggregate balance of Principal Receivables
     in respect of each such Designated Account (the "Designated Balance") and
     amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Buyer a computer file or microfiche
     or written list containing a true and complete list of the Removed
     Accounts specifying for each such Account, as of the Removal Commencement
     Date, its account number, the aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding
     in such Account and the Designated Balance;

              (iii) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, cease to
     transfer to the Buyer any and all Receivables arising in such Designated
     Accounts;

              (iv) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, allocate all
     Collections of Principal Receivables in respect of each Designated
     Account, first to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     Designated Account, until the Determination Date on which the Designated
     Balance with respect to such Designated Account is reduced to zero (the
     "Removal Date");

              (v) on each Business Day from and after such Removal Commencement
     Date to and until the related Removal Date, allocate (A) to the Buyer
     Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in
     respect of each Designated Account, based on the ratio of the aggregate
     amount of Principal Receivables in all Designated Accounts sold to the
     Buyer on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of Principal
     Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such Business Day and (B)
     to the Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and Collections
     of Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such
     Business Day;

              (vi) represent and warrant that the removal of any such Eligible
     Account on any Removal Date shall not, in the reasonable belief of the
     Seller, cause an Early Redemption Event to occur or cause the Pool
     Balance to be less than the Required Participation Amount;

              (vii) represent and warrant that no selection procedures believed
     by the Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust or the Secured
     Parties were utilized in selecting the Designated Accounts;

              (viii) represent and warrant as of the Removal Date that the list
     of Removed Accounts delivered pursuant to clause (ii) above, as of the
     Removal Commencement Date, is true and complete in all material respects;
     and

              (ix) on or before the related Removal Commencement Date, deliver
     to Buyer, the Trust, the Trustee and any Enhancement Providers an
     Officers' Certificate confirming the items set forth in clauses (vi) and
     (viii) above and confirming that the Seller reasonably believes that the
     removal of the Removed Accounts will not result in the occurrence of an
     Early Redemption Event; the Buyer may conclusively rely on such Officers'
     Certificate and shall have no duty to make inquiries with regard to the
     matters set forth therein and shall incur no liability in so relying.

          (c) Subject to Section 2.06(b), on the Removal Date with respect to
any such Designated Account, the Seller shall cease to allocate any
Collections therefrom in accordance with Section 2.06(b) and such Designated
Account shall be deemed removed by operation of this Agreement for all
purposes (a "Removed Account"). After the Removal Date and upon the written
request of the Servicer, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a reassignment
in substantially the form of Exhibit D (the "Reassignment").

          The Seller and the Buyer each hereby ratifies, confirms and adopts
each Removed Account that has been removed in accordance with the terms of the
Existing Agreement prior to the Effective Date.

          SECTION 2.07. Removal of Ineligible Accounts.

          (a) On any date on which an Account becomes an Ineligible Account
(which shall be deemed the Removal Commencement Date with respect to such
Account), the Seller shall commence removal of the Receivables of such
Ineligible Account in the manner prescribed in Section 2.07(b).

          (b) With respect to each Account that becomes an Ineligible Account,
the Seller (or the Servicer on its behalf) shall take the following actions
and make the following determinations:

              (i) furnish to the Buyer, the Trust, the Trustee and any
     Enhancement Providers a Removal Notice specifying a Removal Commencement
     Date and the Ineligible Accounts to be treated as Designated Accounts;

              (ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with respect to
     such Designated Accounts the Designated Balance with respect to each such
     Designated Account and amend Schedule 1 by delivering to the Buyer a
     computer file or microfiche or written list containing a true and
     complete list of the Removed Accounts specifying for each such Account,
     as of the Removal Commencement Date, its account number, the aggregate
     amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account and the Designated
     Balance;

              (iii) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, cease to
     transfer to the Buyer any and all Receivables arising in such Designated
     Accounts;

              (iv) from and after such Removal Commencement Date, allocate
     Collections of Principal Receivables in respect of each Designated
     Account, first to the oldest outstanding principal balance of such
     Designated Account, until the Removal Date with respect thereto; and

              (v) on each Business Day from and after such Removal Commencement
     Date to and until the related Removal Date, allocate (A) to the Buyer
     Defaulted Receivables and Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in
     respect of each Designated Account, based on the ratio of the aggregate
     amount of Principal Receivables in all Designated Accounts sold to the
     Buyer on such Business Day to the total aggregate amount of Principal
     Receivables in all such Designated Accounts on such Business Day


                                      13
<PAGE>


     and (B) to the Seller, the remainder of the Defaulted Receivables and
     Collections of Non-Principal Receivables in all such Designated Accounts
     on such Business Day.

          (c) On the Removal Date with respect to any such Designated Account,
the Seller shall cease to allocate any Collections therefor in accordance
herewith and such Designated Account shall be deemed a Removed Account. After
the Removal Date and upon the written request of the Servicer, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller a Reassignment.

          SECTION 2.08. Sale of Ineligible Receivables.

          The Seller shall sell to the Buyer on each Transfer Date any and all
Receivables arising in any Eligible Accounts that are Ineligible Receivables,
provided that on the Cut-Off Date or, in the case of Receivables arising in
Additional Accounts, on the related Additional Cut-Off Date, and on the
applicable Transfer Date, the Account in which such Receivables arise is an
Eligible Account.

          SECTION 2.09. Common Collateral Security.

          (a) With respect to a Dealer that is the obligor under Receivables
that have been or will be sold to the Buyer hereunder, the Seller may be or
become a lender to such Dealer under an agreement or arrangement other than a
Floorplan Financing Agreement (a "Nonfloorplan Agreement") pursuant to which
the Seller (either directly, or as assignee of the originator of the Account)
has been granted a security interest in the same Collateral Security (the
"Common Collateral Security") in which the Floorplan Financing Agreement for
such Dealer creates a security interest. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) a
Nonfloorplan Agreement and a Floorplan Financing Agreement entered into by a
Dealer and the Seller may be evidenced by a single master financing agreement
between such parties and (ii) reference in this Section 2.09 to the Common
Collateral Security includes the collateral in which the Dealer has granted a
security interest pursuant to the Nonfloorplan Agreement.

          (b) The Seller agrees that with respect to each Receivable of each
such Dealer (i) the security interest in such Common Collateral Security
granted to the Seller pursuant to any Nonfloorplan Agreement is junior and
subordinate to the security interest in such Common Collateral Security
created by the related Floorplan Financing Agreement, (ii) the Seller has no
legal right to realize upon such Common Collateral Security or exercise its
rights under the Nonfloorplan Agreement in any manner that is materially
adverse to the Buyer, the Trust, the Trustee, the Noteholders or the other
Secured Parties in respect of the Common Collateral Security until all
required payments in respect of such Receivable under the Floorplan Financing
Agreement have been paid, (iii) in realizing upon such Common Collateral
Security, none of the Buyer, the Trust or the Trustee will have any obligation
to protect or preserve the rights of the Seller in such Common Collateral
Security and (iv) in the event that the Seller receives any proceeds in
respect of such Common Collateral Security prior to the payment in full of
such Receivable under the Floorplan Financing Agreement, the Seller shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Buyer, the Trust, the Trustee,
the Noteholders and/or the other Secured Parties and shall pay over and
deliver forthwith such proceeds to the Trustee. The Seller and the Buyer each
hereby convenants and agrees that the foregoing agreement in this paragraph


                                      14
<PAGE>

constitutes a subordination agreement for purposes of Section 510(a) of Title
11 of the United States Code, as amended.

          (c) If the Seller in any manner assigns or transfers any rights
under, or any obligation evidenced or secured by, a Nonfloorplan Agreement,
the Seller will make such assignment or transfer subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.09 and require such assignee or transferee to acknowledge that
it takes such assignment or transfer subject to the provisions of this Section
2.09 and to agree that it will require the same acknowledgment from any
subsequent assignee or transferee.

to the Servicer.

          (a) The Seller agrees to act as the Servicer under this Agreement.
Prior to the Effective Date, the Seller was the Servicer under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement. From and after the Effective Date, the Seller will be the

have the authority to make any management decisions relating to such
Receivables, to the extent such authority is granted to the Servicer under
this Agreement and under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, as applicable.

          (b) The Servicer shall service and administer the Receivables in
accordance with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement prior to
the Effective Date and in accordance with the provisions of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement from and after the Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.02. Servicing Compensation.

servicing activities hereunder and under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee on each
Distribution Date (each as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement).
Such Servicing Fee shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement.

          (b) From and after the Effective Date, as full compensation for its
servicing activities hereunder and under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee on each Payment Date.

          SECTION 5.01. Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption, of the
Obligations of the Seller.

          The Seller shall not consolidate with or merge into any other Person
or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety
to any Person, unless:

          (a) The Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Seller
is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer the
properties and assets of the Seller substantially as an entirety shall be a
Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America
or any State or the District of Columbia and, if the Seller is not the
surviving entity, such Person shall assume, without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, the
performance of every covenant and obligation of the Seller hereunder; and

          (b) the Seller has delivered to the Buyer, the Trust and the Trustee
an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such
consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer comply with this Section 5.01
and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such
transaction have been complied with.

          SECTION 5.02. Seller Indemnification of the Buyer.

of or based on the arrangement created by this Agreement and the activities of
the Seller taken pursuant thereto, including any judgment, award, settlement,
reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs or expenses incurred in connection
with the defense of any actual or threatened action, proceeding or claim;
provided, however, that the Seller shall not indemnify the Buyer if such acts,
omissions or alleged acts or omissions constitute fraud, gross negligence or
wilful misconduct by the Buyer; and provided further, that the Seller shall
not indemnify the Buyer for any liabilities, cost or expense of the Buyer with
respect to any Federal,


                                      16
<PAGE>

                                  ARTICLE VI

                                  TERMINATION

          SECTION 6.01. Termination.

          This Agreement will terminate immediately after the Trust dissolves
pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Trust Agreement. In addition, the Buyer shall
not purchase Receivables nor shall the Seller designate Additional Accounts if
the Seller shall become an involuntary party to (or be made the subject of)
any proceeding provided for by any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to
the Seller or relating to all or substantially all of its property (an
"Involuntary Case") and such Involuntary Case shall have continued for a
period of ten Business Days from and including the day of receipt by the
Seller at its principal corporate office of notice of such Involuntary Case;
provided, that during such ten Business Day period, the Buyer shall suspend
its purchase of Receivables and shall hold all Collections of Principal
Receivables that would have been available to purchase Receivables in the
Collection Account and (a) if by the first Business Day after such ten
Business Day period, the Buyer has not obtained an order from the court having
jurisdiction of such case or filing which order approves the continuation of
the sale of Receivables by the Seller to the Buyer and which provided that the
Buyer and any of its transferees (including the Trustee) may rely on such
order for the validity and nonavoidance of such transfer (the "Order"), the
Buyer shall hold such Collections in the Collection Account until such time as
they may be paid as elsewhere provided herein and shall not purchase
Receivables thereafter or designate Additional Accounts for transfer to the
Buyer, or (b) if by such first Business Day, the Buyer has obtained such
Order, the Seller may continue selling Receivables, and the Buyer may continue
purchasing Receivables, pursuant to the terms hereof, as modified by the
immediately succeeding sentence. During the period after the ten Business Day
period described above and before the 60-day period before filing described
below, the purchase price of the Receivables transferred during such period,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shall be paid to
the Seller by the Buyer in cash not later than the same Business Day of any
sale of Receivables. During such period, Receivables will be considered
transferred to the Buyer only to the extent that the purchase price therefor
has been paid in cash on the same Business Day. If an order is obtained but
subsequently is reversed or rescinded or expires, the Seller shall immediately
cease selling Receivables to the Buyer and the Buyer shall immediately cease
buying Receivables. If by the first Business Day after the 60-day period after
such involuntary filing, such Involuntary Case has not been dismissed, the
Buyer shall not purchase thereafter Receivables or designated Additional
Accounts for transfer to the Trust.

                           MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

          SECTION 7.01. Amendment.

          (a) This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Seller
and the Buyer; provided, however, that such action shall not, as evidenced by
an Opinion of Counsel for the Seller addressed and delivered to the Trust and
the Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any
Noteholder.

          (b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the
Buyer and Seller with the consent of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less
than 66-2/3% of the aggregate Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of the Notes
of all adversely affected Series or Classes, for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the
amount of or delay the timing of any distributions to be made to Noteholders
or deposits of amounts to be so distributed with the amount available under
any Enhancement Agreement without the consent of each affected Noteholder,
(ii) change the definition of or the manner of calculating the interest of any
Noteholders without the consent of each affected Noteholder, (iii) reduce the
aforesaid percentage required to consent to any such amendment without the
consent of each Noteholder or (iv) adversely affect the rating of any Series
or Class by each Note Rating Agency without the consent of each affected
Noteholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any
amendment to be effected pursuant to this paragraph (b) without the consent of
each adversely affected Noteholder shall be subject to the Trustee's receipt
of written confirmation from each applicable Note Rating Agency that such
amendment will not have a Ratings Effect with respect to the adversely
affected Notes. Any amendment to be effected pursuant to this paragraph (b)
shall be deemed to adversely affect all outstanding Series and Classes, other
than any Series or Class with respect to which such action shall not, as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel for the Seller, addressed and delivered to
the Trust and the Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Noteholder of such Series or Class.

          (c) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent
(other than an amendment pursuant to paragraph (a)), the Seller shall furnish
notification of the substance of such amendment to the Trust, the Trustee,
each Rating Agency and each Enhancement Provider. Upon its receipt of any such
notice, the Trustee shall promptly forward a copy of such notice to each
Noteholder in accordance with the Indenture.

          (d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders under
this Section 7.01 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment,
but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance
thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders shall be subject to such
reasonable requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.


                                      18
<PAGE>


          (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.01 to the contrary,
no amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Enhancement Provider without the consent
of such Enhancement Provider.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.01 to the contrary,
no amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any holders of the Seller's Certificates
issued by the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement without the consent of the
holders of Seller's Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the
Percentage Interests (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the outstanding
Seller's Certificates.

          SECTION 7.02. Protection of Right, Title and Interest to
Receivables.

          (a) The Seller shall cause this Agreement, all amendments hereto

Receivables and Collateral Security relating thereto to be promptly recorded,
registered and filed, and at all times to be kept recorded, registered and
filed, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law fully
to preserve and protect the right, title and interest of the Buyer hereunder.
The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer file-stamped copies of, or filing
receipts for, any document recorded, registered or filed as provided above, as
soon as available following such recording, registration or filing. The Buyer
shall cooperate fully with the Seller in connection with the obligations set
forth above and will execute any and all documents reasonably required to
fulfill the intent of this Section 7.02(a).

          (b) Within 30 days after the Seller makes any change in its name,
identity or corporate structure which would make any financing statement or
continuation statement filed in accordance with Section 7.02(a) seriously
misleading within the meaning of Section 9-506 of the UCC as in effect in the
State of Michigan, the Seller shall give the Buyer notice of any such change
and shall file such financing statements or amendments as may be necessary to
continue the perfection of the Buyer's security interest in the Receivables
and the proceeds thereof.

          (c) The Seller will give the Buyer prompt written notice of any
relocation of any office at which it keeps records concerning the Receivables
or of its jurisdiction of organization and whether, as a result of such
relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would require the filing of
any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation statement or
of any new financing statement and shall file such financing statements or
amendments as may be necessary to perfect or to continue the perfection of the
Buyer's security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof. The
Seller will at all times maintain its jurisdiction of organization within the
United States of America.

          (d) The Seller will deliver to the Buyer: (i) upon the execution and
delivery of each amendment of this Agreement, an Opinion of Counsel to the

Interest on any date of determination which is in excess of the Required
Participation Amount and (b) any other assets of the Buyer not pledged to
third parties or otherwise encumbered in a manner permitted by the Seller's
organizational documents; provided, however, that any payment by the Seller
made in accordance with this Section 7.03 shall be made only after payment in
full of any amounts that the Seller is obligated to deposit in the Collection
Account pursuant to this Agreement; provided further that the Noteholders
shall be entitled to the benefits of the subordination, if any, of the
Collections allocable to the Seller's Interest to the extent provided in the
Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements.

          SECTION 7.04. No Petition.

          The Seller hereby covenants and agrees that it will not at any time
institute against the Buyer any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United

          If any one or more of the covenants, agreements, provisions or terms
of this Agreement shall for any reason whatsoever be held invalid, then such
covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the
remaining covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement and

                                    FORM OF
               ASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS

                        (As required by Section 2.04 of
                      the Receivables Purchase Agreement)

          ASSIGNMENT NO. __ OF RECEIVABLES IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS, dated as of
___________, _____, between DaimlerChrysler Wholesale Receivables LLC, as
buyer (the "Buyer") and DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC, as seller
(the "Seller"), pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement referred to
below.

                            W I T N E S S E T H :

          WHEREAS, the Seller and the Buyer are parties to the Second Amended
and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2004 (as
amended or supplemented, the "Receivables Purchase Agreement");

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Seller
wishes to designate Additional Accounts to be included as Accounts and to
convey the Receivables of such Additional Accounts, whether now existing or
thereafter created, to the Buyer (as each such term is defined in the
Receivables Purchase Agreement); and

          WHEREAS, the Buyer is willing to accept such designation and
conveyance subject to the terms and conditions hereof;

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Seller and the Buyer hereby agree as follows:

          1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Receivables Purchase Agreement unless
otherwise defined herein.

          "Addition Date" shall mean, with respect to the Additional Accounts
     designated hereby, ___________, _____.

          "Additional Accounts" shall mean, the Additional Accounts, as
     defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, that are designated hereby
     and listed on Schedule 1 hereto.

          "Additional Cut-Off Date" shall mean, with respect to the Additional
     Accounts designated hereby, ___________, _____.

          2. Designation of Additional Accounts. The Seller hereby delivers
herewith a computer file or microfiche or written list containing a true and
complete list identifying all such Additional Accounts specifying for each
such Account, as of the Additional Cut-Off Date, its account number, the
aggregate amount of Receivables outstanding in such Account and the



                                     A-1
<PAGE>


aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in such Account. Such file,
microfiche or list shall, as of the date of this Assignment supplement
Schedule 1, to the Agreement.

          3. Conveyance of Receivables. (a) The Seller does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey, without recourse (except as
expressly provided in the Receivables Purchase Agreement), to the Buyer, on
the Addition Date all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the
Receivables in such Additional Accounts and all Collateral Security with
respect thereto owned by the Seller and existing at the close of business on
the Additional Cut-Off Date and all monies due or to become due and all
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds (including Recoveries)
thereof. The foregoing sale, transfer, assignment, set-over and conveyance
does not constitute and is not intended to result in the creation or an
assumption by the Buyer of any obligation of the Servicer, the Seller,
DaimlerChrysler or any other Person in connection with the Accounts, the
Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto, including
any obligation to any Dealers.

          (b) In connection with such sale, the Seller agrees to record and
file, at its own expense, a financing statement on form UCC-1 (and
continuation statements when applicable) with respect to the Receivables now
existing and hereafter created for the sale of "tangible chattel paper",
"accounts" or "payment intangibles" (each as defined in Section 9-102 of the
UCC as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction) meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect the sale and assignment of the Receivables and the Collateral
Security to the Buyer, and to deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing
statements or other evidence of such filing to the Buyer on or prior to the
Addition Date. In addition, the Seller shall cause to be timely filed in the
appropriate filing office any UCC-1 financing statement and continuation
statement necessary to perfect any sale of Receivables to the Seller. The
Buyer shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file such financing
statement, or a continuation statement to such financing statement, or to make
any other filing under the UCC in connection with such sale.

          (c) In connection with such sale, the Seller further agrees, at its
own expense, on or prior to the Addition Date to indicate in its computer
files that the Receivables created in connection with the Additional Accounts
designated hereby have been sold and the Collateral Security assigned, to the
Buyer pursuant to this Assignment and sold to the Trust pursuant to the Sale
and Servicing Agreement and pledged by the Trust to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the
Indenture.

          (d) The parties hereto intend that the transfers of Receivables and
related Collateral Security effected by this Assignment be sales.
Nevertheless, if such transfers are deemed to be transfers for security, then
this Assignment also shall be deemed to be and hereby is a security agreement
within the meaning of the UCC, and the conveyance by the Seller provided for
in this Assignment shall also be deemed to be and hereby is a grant by the
Seller to the Buyer of a security interest in all of the Seller's right, title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under such
Receivables and related Collateral Security.

          4. Acceptance by the Buyer. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6 of this Assignment, the Buyer hereby
acknowledges its acceptance of all right, title and interest to the property,
now existing and hereafter created, conveyed to the Buyer


                                     A-2
<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Assignment. The Buyer further acknowledges
that, prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Assignment, the Seller delivered to the Buyer the computer file or microfiche
or written list described in Section 2 of this Assignment.

          5. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Buyer as of the date of this Assignment and as
of the Addition Date that:

               (a) Legal, Valid and Binding Obligation. This Assignment
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
     enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
     effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and
     except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of
     equity (whether considered in a suit at law or equity).

               (b) Organization and Good Standing. The Seller is a limited
     liability company duly organized and validly existing and in good
     standing under the law of the State of Michigan and has, in all material
     respects, full power, authority and legal right to own its properties
     and conduct its business as such properties are presently owned and such
     business is presently conducted, and to execute, deliver and perform its
     obligations under this Assignment.

              (c) Due Qualification. The Seller is duly qualified to do
     business and, where necessary, is in good standing as a foreign company
     (or is exempt from such requirement) and has obtained all necessary
     licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
     business requires such qualification except where the failure to so
     qualify or obtain licenses or approvals would not have a material adverse
     effect on its ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

              (d) Eligible Accounts. Each Additional Account designated
     hereby is an Eligible Account.

              (e) Selection Procedures. No selection procedures believed
     by the Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Buyer, the Trust or
     the Secured Parties were used in selecting the Additional Accounts
     designated hereby.

              (f) Insolvency. As of the Notice Date and the Addition Date,
     neither the Seller, the Buyer nor the Servicer are insolvent nor will any
     of them have been made insolvent after giving effect to the conveyance
     set forth in Section 3 of this Assignment, nor are any of them aware of
     any pending insolvency.

              (g) Valid Transfer. This Assignment constitutes a valid
     sale, transfer and assignment to the Buyer of all right, title and
     interest of the Seller in the Receivables and the Collateral Security
     thereof. Upon the filing of the financing statements described in Section
     3 of this Assignment with the Secretary of State of the State of Michigan
     [and other applicable states] and, in the case of the Receivables
     hereafter created and the proceeds thereof, upon the creation thereof,
     the Buyer shall have a first priority perfected


                                     A-3

     ownership interest in such property, subject to the rights of the
     Purchasers in any Collateral Security in respect of the Partial Accounts
     (other than vehicles relating to Principal Receivables arising in the
     Partial Accounts). Except for Liens permitted under the Receivables
     Purchase Agreement and under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, neither
     the Seller nor any Person claiming through or under the Seller has any
     claim to or interest in the Collateral of the Trust.

              (h) Due Authorization. The execution and delivery of this
     Assignment and the consummation of the transactions provided for or
     contemplated by this Assignment have been duly authorized by the Seller
     by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Seller.

              (i) No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this
     Assignment, the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
     Assignment and the fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof, will not
     conflict with, result in any breach of any of the material terms and
     provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
     both) a material default under, any indenture, contract, agreement,
     mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to which such Seller is a
     party or by which it or its properties are bound.

              (j) No Violation. The execution and delivery of this
     Assignment by the Seller, the performance of the transactions
     contemplated by this Assignment and the fulfillment of the terms hereof
     and thereof, will not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the
     material terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice
     or lapse of time or both) a material default under, any indenture,
     contract, agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument to
     which the Seller is a party or by which it or its properties are bound.

              (k) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or, to the best
     knowledge of the Seller, investigations pending or threatened against the
     Seller, before any Governmental Authority (i) asserting the invalidity of
     this Assignment, (ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the
     transactions contemplated by this Assignment, (iii) seeking any
     determination or ruling that, in the reasonable judgment of the Seller,
     would materially and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of
     its obligations under this Assignment, (iv) seeking any determination or
     ruling that would materially and adversely affect the validity or
     enforceability of this Assignment, (v) seeking any determination or
     ruling that would materially and adversely affect the validity or
     enforceability of this Agreement or the Certificates or (vi) seeking to
     affect adversely the income tax attributes of the Trust under the United
     States Federal or any state income, single business or franchise tax
     systems.

              (l) Record of Accounts. As of the Addition Date, Schedule 1
     to this Assignment is an accurate and complete listing in all material
     respects of all the Additional Accounts as of the Additional Cut-Off Date

pursuant to Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code or subject to the automatic

Schedule 1 to this Reassignment and shall be incorporated into and made a part
of this Reassignment as of the Removal Date and shall amend Schedule 1 to the
Receivables Purchase Agreement.

          (iii) Conveyance of Receivables and Accounts.

               (1) The Buyer does hereby transfer, assign, set over and
     otherwise convey to the Seller, without recourse, representation or
     warranty on and after the Removal Date, all right, title and interest of
     the Trust in, to and under all Receivables now existing at the close of
     business on the Removal Date and thereafter created from time to time
     until the termination of the Trust in Removed Accounts designated hereby,
     all Collateral Security thereof, all monies due or to become due and all
     amounts received with respect thereto (including all Non-Principal
     Receivables), all proceeds (as defined in Section 9-315 of the UCC as in
     effect in the State of Michigan and Recoveries) thereof relating thereto.

              (2) If requested by the Buyer, in connection with such
     transfer, the Buyer agrees to execute and deliver to the Seller on or
     prior to the date of this Reassignment, a termination statement with
     respect to the Receivables existing at the close of business on the
     Removal Date and thereafter created from time to time and Collateral
     Security thereof in the Removed Accounts reassigned hereby (which may be
     a single termination statement with respect to all such Receivables and
     Collateral Security) evidencing the release by the Trust of its lien on
     the Receivables in the Removed Accounts and the Collateral Security, and
     meeting the requirements of applicable state law, in such manner and such
     jurisdictions as are necessary to remove such lien.

          (iv) Acceptance by Buyer. The Buyer hereby acknowledges that, prior
to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Reassignment, the
Seller delivered to the Buyer the computer file or microfiche or written list
described in paragraph (ii) of this Reassignment.

          (v) Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Buyer as of the Removal Date:

              (1) Legal, Valid and Binding Obligation. This Reassignment
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
     enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in
     effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
     except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of
     equity (whether considered in a suit at law or in equity);

              (2) No Early Redemption Event. The removal of any such
     Eligible Account hereby removed shall not, in the reasonable belief of
     the Seller, cause an Early


                                     D-2

     Redemption Event to occur or cause the Pool Balance to be less than the
     Required Participation Amount;

              (3) Selection Procedures. No selection procedures believed
     by the Seller to be adverse to the interests of the Trust or the Secured
     Parties were utilized in selecting the Designated Accounts; and

              (4) List of Removed Accounts. The list of Removed Accounts
     delivered pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this Reassignment, as of the
     Removal Commencement Date, is true and complete in all material respects;
     provided, however, that in the event that the removal on such Removal
     Date relates solely to Ineligible Accounts, the Seller shall be deemed
     to make only the representations and warranties contained in paragraph
     (v)(1) above.

          (vi) Conditions Precedent. The ratification of the Receivables
Purchase Agreement set forth in paragraph (vii) hereof is subject to the
satisfaction, on or prior to the Removal Date, of the following condition
precedent:

              Officers' Certificate. The Seller shall have delivered to the
     Buyer, the Trust, the Trustee and the Enhancement Providers an Officers'
     Certificate certifying that each of the representations and warranties
     made by the Seller in paragraph (v) hereof is true and correct as of the
     Removal Date and that the Seller reasonably believes that the removal of
     the Removed Accounts will not result in the occurrence of an Early
     Redemption Event. The Buyer may conclusively rely on such Officers'
     Certificate, shall have no duty to make inquiries with regard to the
     matters set forth therein and shall incur no liability in so relying.

          (vii) Ratification of Receivables Purchase Agreement. As
supplemented by this Reassignment, the Receivables Purchase Agreement is in
all respects ratified and confirmed and the Receivables Purchase Agreement as
so supplemented by this Reassignment shall be read, taken and construed as one
and the same instrument.

          (viii) Counterparts. This Reassignment may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of
which shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

          (ix) GOVERNING LAW. THIS REASSIGNMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS
CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.
