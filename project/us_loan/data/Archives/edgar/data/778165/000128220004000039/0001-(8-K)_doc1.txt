Item  4.01  Changes  in  Registrant's  Certifying  Accountant

Registrant's  independent accountant, DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, who was engaged
as  principal  accountant to audit the registrant's financial statements for the
registrant's  two  most  recent  years,  resigned  effective  December 22, 2004.

DeCoria,  Maichel & Teague's report on the financial statements for the past two
did  not  contain  in  adverse  opinion  or  disclaimer  of opinion, and was not
modified  as  to  uncertainty,  audit  scope,  or  accounting  principles.

There  were  no  disagreements  with  DeCoria,  Maichel  &  Teague,  resolved or
unresolved,  on  any  matter  of  accounting  principles or practices, financial
statement  disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to
the  former accountant's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to
the  subject  matter  of  the  disagreements  in  connection  with  its reports.



                                   SIGNATURES

     Pursuant  to  the  requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrant  has  duly  caused  this  report  to  be  signed on its behalf by the
undersigned  hereunto  duly  authorized.
