          THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of _______________, between Atlas Air
Worldwide Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and

          WHEREAS, the Director has been granted an award under the Company's

and


          WHEREAS, the plan of reorganization for the Company became effective

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties
hereto agree as follows.


          1. AWARD OF SHARES. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference, the Director is hereby awarded

the Plan and those herein set forth. The Award is granted as of _______________
(the "DATE OF Grant"). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have
the meanings set forth in the Plan. In the event of any conflict between this
Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control.


          2. VESTING OF AWARD; TREATMENT UPON TERMINATION OF SERVICE. Unless
otherwise provided by the Committee, all Awards of Restricted Shares under this
Agreement and all dividends and other amounts receivable in connection with any
adjustments to the Shares under Section 4(c) of the Plan shall be subject to the
vesting schedule in this Section 2.


               (a) VESTING GENERALLY. Subject to the following provisions of
this Section 2 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Award
shall become vested in three (3) annual installments, with (i) the first
installment (equal to _____ of the Restricted Shares) vesting on _____, (ii) the

<PAGE>


SERVICE", as it relates to the Director, means the termination of the Director's
directorship with the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, as the case
may be, with (a) the Director ceasing to serve as a director of a Subsidiary of
the Company or one of its Affiliates being deemed to incur a Termination of
Service if the Subsidiary of the Company or Affiliate ceases to be such a
Subsidiary or an Affiliate, as the case may be, unless the Director immediately
thereafter becomes a director of the Company, another Subsidiary of the Company
or an Affiliate, and (b) transfers among the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates not being considered a Termination of Service.


               (b) TERMINATION. In the event of Termination of Service of the
Director by reason of the Director's death or Disability (as defined below), the
Award shall become immediately vested in full. For purposes of this Agreement, a
Termination of Service shall be due to "DISABILITY" of the Director if upon such
Termination of Service the Director qualifies for long term disability benefits
under the Company's Long Term Disability Plan.


               (c) CHANGE IN CONTROL. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section 2 to the contrary, the Award shall become immediately vested in full
upon a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below). For purposes of this
Agreement, "CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY" means and shall be deemed to have
occurred if (i) any Person (within the meaning of the Exchange Act) or any two
(2) or more Persons acting in concert shall have acquired beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of voting securities of the Company (or other securities convertible
into voting securities of the Company) representing 40% or more of the combined
voting power of all securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election
of directors, other than securities having such power only by reason of the
happening of a contingency, or (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
not consist of a majority of Continuing Directors. For purposes of this
Agreement, "CONTINUING DIRECTORS" shall mean the directors of the Company on the
date hereof, and any person becoming a director after the date hereof, if such
other director's nomination for election to the Board of Directors of the
Company is recommended by a majority of the then Continuing Directors.

               (d) FORFEITURE. That portion of the Award which is not vested
immediately following the Director's Termination of Service, as described above,
shall be immediately forfeited to the Company.
