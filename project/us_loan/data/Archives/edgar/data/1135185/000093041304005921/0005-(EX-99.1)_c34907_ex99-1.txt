                       ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS, INC.
                       REPORTS PRELIMINARY NOVEMBER SYSTEM
                         STATISTICS AND TRAFFIC RESULTS

PURCHASE,  N.Y., DECEMBER 23, 2004 - Atlas Air Worldwide  Holdings,  Inc. (AAWW)
(OTC: AAWWV.PK),  a leading provider of global air cargo services,  has reported
preliminary  system  statistics  and traffic  results  for  November  2004,  the
eleven-month  period  ended  November 30, 2004,  and the  corresponding  periods
during 2003.

During  November,  AAWW  operated  an average  of 39.0  wide-body  747  aircraft
compared  with an  average  of 45.0 in  November  2003,  principally  due to the
rejection  and return of aircraft  in  conjunction  with  AAWW's  restructuring.
Despite the 13.3% reduction in operating fleet, total block-hour activity during
November  decreased just 3.5% compared with the same month in 2003.  Block hours
operated in the ACMI  segment  increased  20.9% year over year,  while  Military
Charter hours increased 44.4% and Commercial Charter hours declined 40.3%.

Traffic in the  Scheduled  Service  business  (as  measured by revenue ton miles
"RTM's")  decreased  22.2%  year over  year,  while  capacity  (as  measured  by
available ton miles  "ATM's")  decreased  32.3% year over year,  resulting in an
increased load factor of 66.2% in November compared with 57.6% in November 2003.

For the eleven months ended November 30, 2004,  AAWW operated an average of 37.6
wide-body 747 aircraft,  16.4% less than the 45.0 aircraft averaged in the first
eleven  months  of 2003.  Total  block-hour  activity  during  the 2004  period,
however,  declined just 3.2% compared with the same period in 2003.  Block hours
operated in the ACMI segment rose 21.0% during the eleven months ended  November
30, 2004 versus the same time frame in 2003.  Commercial  Charter hours declined
45.9% and Military Charter hours declined 38.9%.

Traffic in the Scheduled Service business  increased 13.0% (in RTM terms) during
the eleven  months ended  November 30, 2004 compared with the same period during
the prior year, and capacity (in ATM's)  increased 2.8% compared with the eleven
months ended  November 30, 2003,  resulting in an increased load factor of 62.7%
for the 2004 period compared with 57.0% for the 2003 period.

The  preliminary  system  statistics  and  traffic  results  that  follow do not
constitute financial statements,  were not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted  accounting  principles,  and

assumptions  not  identified  above  are also  involved  in the  preparation  of
forward-looking   statements,   and  the  failure  of  such  other  factors  and
assumptions  to be realized may also cause actual  results to differ  materially
from those discussed.

AAWW assumes no obligation to update such  statements  contained in this release
to reflect  actual  results,  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors
