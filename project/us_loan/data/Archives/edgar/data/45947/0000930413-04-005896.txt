020  Funding  Agreement  and the  2004-021  Funding  Agreement  are  referred to
collectively  herein as the  "Funding  Agreements."  The Trusts  were  formed on
December  20,  2004  (the  "Formation  Date")  and the  Notes  will be issued on
December 23, 2004 (the "Issuance Date").

         We have  acted as  special  counsel  to Bear  Stearns  & Co.  Inc.,  in
connection  with the  preparation  and filing with the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission")  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act"),  by Hartford  Life, of a  Registration  Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos.
333-112244),  as amended by Amendment  No. 1 filed with the  Commission on March
16, 2003, Amendment No. 2 filed with the Commission on May 4, 2004 and Amendment
No. 3 filed with the Commission on July 27, 2004 (the "Registration Statement"),
including a prospectus (the "Prospectus") relating to secured notes to be issued
by newly formed  statutory trusts formed under the laws of the State of Delaware
and a prospectus  supplement  relating to Hartford  Life  IncomeNotes(sm)  to be
issued by the trusts (the  "Retail  Prospectus  Supplement").  The  Registration
Statement  provides for: (i) the  registration of up to  $2,000,000,000,  or the
equivalent amount in one or more foreign currencies,  aggregate principal amount
of  notes  to be  issued  by the  trusts  and  (ii)  the  registration  of up to
$2,000,000,000,  or the equivalent amount in one or more foreign currencies,  of
Hartford  Life's funding  agreements to be sold to the trusts in connection with
the sale of notes.

         In furnishing  this opinion,  we have  reviewed:  (i) the  Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and the Retail Prospectus Supplement,  and each of the
pricing  supplements related to the Notes, each such pricing supplement dated as
of the  Formation  Date,  (ii)  each of the  trust  agreements,  dated as of the
Formation Date (the "Trust  Agreements"),  between Wilmington Trust Company,  as
trustee,  and AMACAR Pacific Corp., as trust beneficial  owner,  which adopt and
incorporate  the  standard  trust terms dated July 23,  2004,  (iii) each of the
indentures,  dated as of the Issuance Date (the "Indentures"),  between JPMorgan
Chase Bank,  N.A.,  as  indenture  trustee  (the  "Indenture  Trustee")  and the
relevant Trust,  which adopt and incorporate the standard  indenture terms dated
July  23,  2004,  (iv)  each of the  distribution  agreements,  dated  as of the
Formation Date (the  "Distribution  Agreements"),  between  Hartford Life,  Bear
Stearns & Co. Inc.,  on behalf of itself and each of the other  agents,  and the
relevant Trust, which adopt and incorporate the standard distribution  agreement
terms dated July 23, 2004, (v) each of the omnibus instruments,  dated as of the
Formation  Date,  which  include the relevant  Trust  Agreement,  Indenture  and
Distribution  Agreement  executed in connection  with the creation of the Trusts
and  the  issuance  by the  Trusts  of  the  Notes,  (vi)  each  of the  closing
instruments,  dated as of the Issuance  Date,  related to each  relevant  Trust,
(vii) the Notes and (viii) each of the Funding Agreements.

         We have also reviewed the trust action of the Trusts in connection with
the issuance of the Notes,  and have examined,  and have relied as to matters of
fact  upon,  originals  or  copies  certified  or  otherwise  identified  to our
satisfaction, of such records, agreements,  documents, and other instruments and
such  certificates or comparable  documents of public  officials and of officers
and   representatives   of  the  Trust,   and  have  made  such  other   further
investigations  as we

have deemed  relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions  hereinafter set
forth. In such  examination,  we have assumed the  authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as  originals,  the  genuineness  of all  signatures,  the legal
capacity of all natural persons and the conformity  with the original  documents
of any copies submitted to us for our examination.  We have relied as to factual
matters upon, and have assumed the accuracy of, representations,  statements and
certificates  of  or  from  public   officials  and  of  or  from  officers  and
representations of all persons whom we have deemed appropriate.

         Based  upon  the  foregoing,  and  subject  to the  qualifications  and
limitations  stated  herein,  we are of the  opinion  that  upon the  execution,
issuance,  authentication  and delivery of the Notes, the relevant Notes will be
the valid and binding  obligations of the relevant  Trust,  enforceable  against
such Trust in accordance with their terms.

         The above opinions with regard to the  enforceability of the Notes: (i)
are  qualified  by  the  effects  of  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting  creditors' rights generally
and general  principles of equity  (regardless  of whether such  principles  are
considered  in a  proceeding  in equity or at law),  and (ii) are subject to the
further  qualification  that, to the extent that the Notes are  denominated in a
currency  other than  United  States  dollars,  a claim  thereunder  (or foreign
currency  judgment  in respect to such  claim)  would be  converted  into United
States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to
applicable law.

         We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
laws of the State of New York, as currently in effect.  This opinion is rendered
as of the date  hereof  based  upon the facts and law in  existence  on the date
hereof.  We assume no obligation to update or supplement  this letter to reflect
any circumstances  which may hereafter come to our attention with respect to the
opinion and statements set forth above,  including any changes in applicable law
which may hereafter occur.

         We hereby  consent  to the  filing of this  letter as an exhibit to the
Current  Report  on Form  8-K  filed by  Hartford  Life in  connection  with the
issuance and sale of the Notes,  incorporated  by reference in the  Registration
Statement.  In giving such consent, we do not thereby concede that we are within
the category of persons whose consent is required  under Section 7 of the Act or
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

                                      Very truly yours,

                                      /s/ Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP

December 23, 2004

To:  Board of Directors of Hartford Life Insurance Company

RE:    Enforceability of Funding Agreements Issued to Certain Trusts

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am Counsel to Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Hartford Life"), a Connecticut
life insurance corporation.

I am furnishing this opinion in connection with the issuance by Hartford Life of
the funding  agreements  listed below (each a "Contract")  to the trusts (each a
"Trust") listed below on or about the date of this letter:

    CONTRACT                       CONTRACTHOLDER
    --------                       --------------

    Funding Agreement FA-404019    Hartford Life Global Funding Trust 2004 - 019
    Funding Agreement FA-404020    Hartford Life Global Funding Trust 2004 - 020
    Funding Agreement FA-404021    Hartford Life Global Funding Trust 2004 - 021


In each instance the Trust was established  pursuant to the Hartford Life Global
Funding  note  issuance  program  (the  "Program")  described  in  that  certain
registration  statement on Form S-3 (File No.  333-112244)  filed on January 27,
2004 (the "Registration  Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as amended
by Amendment  No. 1 thereto,  filed with the SEC on March 16, 2004; by Amendment
No.  2  thereto,  filed  with the SEC on May 4,  2004;  and by  Amendment  No. 3
thereto,  filed  with  the SEC on July  27,  2004.  The  Registration  Statement
describes (i) the registration  and public offering of up to $2 billion,  in the
aggregate  principal  amount of notes (the  "Notes") to be issued by a series of
trusts and (ii) the  registration  of up to  $2,000,000,000,  or the  equivalent
amount in one or more  foreign  or  composite  currencies,  aggregate  principal
amount of Hartford Life's funding  agreements (each, a "Contract") to be sold to
the trusts  described  below in  connection  with the  issuance  and sale of the
Notes.

Each of the  Trusts  is  intended  to be a  trust  described  in the  prospectus
(including the prospectus  supplement relating to  IncomeNotes(sm)),  both dated
September 7, 2004, and included in the  Registration  Statement  (together,  the
"Prospectus").  Once duly formed, each Trust is authorized to issue no more than
a  single  series  of Notes  and to take  certain  other  actions  necessary  or
appropriate to such issuance. The proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes
are to be used by each Trust to purchase separately from Hartford Life a funding
agreement,  such as the Contracts  listed above. As described in the Prospectus,
the  Notes  issued by each  Trust  are to be  secured  by the  assignment  to an
indenture trustee of its Contract and all proceeds from its Contract.

In  connection  with the  foregoing,  I, or persons under my  supervision,  have
examined an original or copies certified to my satisfaction as being a true copy
of the  certificate  of  incorporation  and bylaws of  Hartford  Life,  and have
reviewed such other corporate records, instruments and other documents as deemed
necessary or appropriate in order to render the opinions set forth herein. I, or
persons under my supervision,  have also reviewed,  in unexecuted  form, each of
the Contracts.

In the  examination of various  documents,  instruments  and records,  including
without  limitation  any referred to in this opinion  letter,  and in connection
with the  opinions  herein  expressed,  I have  assumed  the  competency  of all
individual  signatories,  the  genuineness  of  all  signatures,   submitted  as
certified,  photostatic  or  electronic  copies,  and  the  authenticity  of the
originals of such latter documents.

        (a)   Hartford Life is a Connecticut  domiciled  insurance  company duly
              organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
              Connecticut as a corporation formed for the purposes of conducting
              the business of a life  insurance  company.  Hartford Life has the
              necessary  corporate authority to enter into each of the Contracts
              and to perform its respective obligations thereunder.

        (b)   Hartford Life has obtained licenses from the states of Connecticut
              and  Delaware,  which  authorize  Hartford  Life to  conduct  life
              insurance  business and to issue  insurance  contracts  (including
              each of the  Contracts)  in those  states.  Hartford  Life has all
              necessary  authority to execute and to issue such Contracts  under
              applicable Connecticut and Delaware insurance laws and regulations
              and  orders  and  interpretations  of  the  Connecticut  Insurance
              Department and the Delaware Insurance Department.

        (c)   The  issuance of each of the  Contracts  has been  approved by all
              necessary  corporate action on the part of Hartford Life; and each
              Contract  constitutes the legal,  valid and binding  obligation of
              Hartford Life, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to
              the  extent   enforceability   thereof   may  be  limited  by  (i)
              bankruptcy,   insolvency,   fraudulent   conveyances,   fraudulent
              transfers, reorganization, or moratorium or other similar laws now
              or hereafter in effect relating to or effecting the enforcement of
              creditors'   rights  or  remedies   generally   and  (ii)  general
              principles of equity  (regardless  of whether such  enforcement is
              considered  in a proceeding  in equity or at law),  including  the
              discretion  of  the  court  before  which  any  proceeding  may be
              brought, concepts of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing.


I consent  to the  filing  of this  opinion  with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission as an exhibit to the Current  Report of Hartford Life on Form 8-K and
to the use of my name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus and to
the  incorporation  by  reference of this opinion and consent as exhibits to the
Registration  Statement  filed in accordance  with Rule 462(b) under the Act. In
giving the  foregoing  consents,  I do not thereby  admit that I come within the
category of persons, whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended,  or the rules and  regulations  of the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission thereunder.

Very truly yours,

as the  "Funding  Agreements."  The Trusts were formed on December 20, 2004 (the
"Formation  Date") and the Notes were issued on December 23, 2004 (the "Issuance
Date").

         With your  consent,  we have acted as special  tax  counsel to Hartford
Life  and as  counsel  to Bear  Stearns  & Co.  Inc.,  in  connection  with  the
preparation  and  filing  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the
"Commission")  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended (the  "Act"),  by
Hartford  Life, of a Registration  Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos.  333-112244)
filed with the  Commission  on January 27, 2004,  as amended by Amendment  No. 1
filed with the  Commission  on March 18,  2004,  Amendment  No. 2 filed with the
Commission on May 4, 2004 and Amendment No. 3 filed with the  Commission on July
27,  2004  (the   "Registration   Statement"),   including  a  prospectus   (the
"Prospectus")  relating to secured notes to be issued by newly formed  statutory
trusts  formed  under  the  laws  of the  State  of  Delaware  and a  prospectus
supplement relating to Hartford Life  IncomeNotes(sm) to be issued by the trusts
(the "Retail Prospectus  Supplement").  The Registration Statement provides for:
(i) the registration of up to $2,000,000,000, or the equivalent amount in one or
more foreign currencies, aggregate principal amount of notes to be issued by the
trusts and (ii) the  registration  of up to  $2,000,000,000,  or the  equivalent
amount in one or more foreign currencies,  of Hartford Life's funding agreements
to be sold to the trusts in connection with the sale of notes.

         In furnishing  this opinion,  we have  reviewed:  (i) the  Registration
Statement,  the  Prospectus,  the Retail  Prospectus  Supplement and each of the
pricing  supplements related to the Notes, each such pricing supplement dated as
of the Formation  Date (each,  a "Pricing  Supplement"),  (ii) each of the trust
agreements, dated as of the Formation Date (each, a "Trust Agreement"),  between
Wilmington  Trust  Company,  as  trustee,  and AMACAR  Pacific  Corp.,  as trust
beneficial  owner,  which adopt and  incorporate  the standard trust terms dated
July 23,  2004,  (iii) each of the  indentures,  dated as of the  Issuance  Date
(each, an "Indenture"), between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as indenture trustee,
and the relevant Trust, which adopt and incorporate the standard indenture terms
dated July 23, 2004, (iv) each of the distribution  agreements,  dated as of the
Formation Date (each, a "Distribution  Agreement"),  between Hartford Life, Bear
Stearns & Co. Inc.,  on behalf of itself and each of the other  agents,  and the
relevant Trust, which adopt and incorporate the standard distribution  agreement
terms dated July 23, 2004, (v) each of the omnibus instruments,  dated as of the
Formation  Date,  which  include the relevant  Trust  Agreement,  Indenture  and
Distribution  Agreement  executed in connection  with the creation of the Trusts
and  the  issuance  by the  Trusts  of  the  Notes,  (vi)  each  of the  closing
instruments,  dated as of the Issuance  Date,  related to each  relevant  Trust,
(vii) the  Notes,  (viii)  each of the  Funding  Agreements  and (ix) such other
records,  documents,  certificates or other  instruments as in our judgment were
necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinion  expressed below. We
have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons and the
conformity  with the original  documents  of any copies  submitted to us for our

         Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations,  qualifications
and  assumptions  set forth  herein,  the  discussion  set  forth in the  Retail
Prospectus  Supplement under the heading  "Material United States Federal Income
Tax  Considerations," as supplemented by the discussion set forth in the Pricing
Supplement  related to the 2004-020 Notes, to the extent  describing  matters of
United States federal income tax law or legal  conclusions with respect thereto,
is our opinion.

         In  rendering  the  opinion set forth  above,  we have  considered  the
applicable  provisions  of the Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended (the
"Code"),  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  by the  United  States  Treasury
Department (the  "Regulations"),  pertinent  judicial  authorities,  rulings and
other  administrative  interpretations  of the Internal Revenue Service and such
other  authorities as we have considered  relevant.  It should be noted that the
Code, the Regulations and such judicial authorities, rulings, and administrative
interpretations  and other authorities are subject to change at any time and, in
some  circumstances,  with retroactive  effect; and any such change could affect
the opinion stated herein.

         This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof based upon the facts and
law in  existence  on the date  hereof.  We  assume no  obligation  to update or
supplement this letter to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter
come to our  attention  with  respect to the  opinion and  statements  set forth
above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.

         We hereby  consent  to the  filing of this  letter as an exhibit to the
Current  Report  on Form  8-K  filed by  Hartford  Life in  connection  with the
issuance and sale of the Notes,  incorporated  by reference in the  Registration
Statement.  In giving such consent, we do not thereby concede that we are within
the category of persons whose consent is required  under Section 7 of the Act or
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

                                             Very truly yours,
