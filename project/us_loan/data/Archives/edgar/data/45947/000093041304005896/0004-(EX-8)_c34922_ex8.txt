as the  "Funding  Agreements."  The Trusts were formed on December 20, 2004 (the
"Formation  Date") and the Notes were issued on December 23, 2004 (the "Issuance
Date").

         With your  consent,  we have acted as special  tax  counsel to Hartford
Life  and as  counsel  to Bear  Stearns  & Co.  Inc.,  in  connection  with  the
preparation  and  filing  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the
"Commission")  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended (the  "Act"),  by
Hartford  Life, of a Registration  Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos.  333-112244)
filed with the  Commission  on January 27, 2004,  as amended by Amendment  No. 1
filed with the  Commission  on March 18,  2004,  Amendment  No. 2 filed with the
Commission on May 4, 2004 and Amendment No. 3 filed with the  Commission on July
27,  2004  (the   "Registration   Statement"),   including  a  prospectus   (the
"Prospectus")  relating to secured notes to be issued by newly formed  statutory
trusts  formed  under  the  laws  of the  State  of  Delaware  and a  prospectus
supplement relating to Hartford Life  IncomeNotes(sm) to be issued by the trusts
(the "Retail Prospectus  Supplement").  The Registration Statement provides for:
(i) the registration of up to $2,000,000,000, or the equivalent amount in one or
more foreign currencies, aggregate principal amount of notes to be issued by the
trusts and (ii) the  registration  of up to  $2,000,000,000,  or the  equivalent
amount in one or more foreign currencies,  of Hartford Life's funding agreements
to be sold to the trusts in connection with the sale of notes.

         In furnishing  this opinion,  we have  reviewed:  (i) the  Registration
Statement,  the  Prospectus,  the Retail  Prospectus  Supplement and each of the
pricing  supplements related to the Notes, each such pricing supplement dated as
of the Formation  Date (each,  a "Pricing  Supplement"),  (ii) each of the trust
agreements, dated as of the Formation Date (each, a "Trust Agreement"),  between
Wilmington  Trust  Company,  as  trustee,  and AMACAR  Pacific  Corp.,  as trust
beneficial  owner,  which adopt and  incorporate  the standard trust terms dated
July 23,  2004,  (iii) each of the  indentures,  dated as of the  Issuance  Date
(each, an "Indenture"), between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as indenture trustee,
and the relevant Trust, which adopt and incorporate the standard indenture terms
dated July 23, 2004, (iv) each of the distribution  agreements,  dated as of the
Formation Date (each, a "Distribution  Agreement"),  between Hartford Life, Bear
Stearns & Co. Inc.,  on behalf of itself and each of the other  agents,  and the
relevant Trust, which adopt and incorporate the standard distribution  agreement
terms dated July 23, 2004, (v) each of the omnibus instruments,  dated as of the
Formation  Date,  which  include the relevant  Trust  Agreement,  Indenture  and
Distribution  Agreement  executed in connection  with the creation of the Trusts
and  the  issuance  by the  Trusts  of  the  Notes,  (vi)  each  of the  closing
instruments,  dated as of the Issuance  Date,  related to each  relevant  Trust,
(vii) the  Notes,  (viii)  each of the  Funding  Agreements  and (ix) such other
records,  documents,  certificates or other  instruments as in our judgment were
necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinion  expressed below. We
have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons and the
conformity  with the original  documents  of any copies  submitted to us for our

         Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations,  qualifications
and  assumptions  set forth  herein,  the  discussion  set  forth in the  Retail
Prospectus  Supplement under the heading  "Material United States Federal Income
Tax  Considerations," as supplemented by the discussion set forth in the Pricing
Supplement  related to the 2004-020 Notes, to the extent  describing  matters of
United States federal income tax law or legal  conclusions with respect thereto,
is our opinion.

         In  rendering  the  opinion set forth  above,  we have  considered  the
applicable  provisions  of the Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended (the

Department (the  "Regulations"),  pertinent  judicial  authorities,  rulings and
other  administrative  interpretations  of the Internal Revenue Service and such
other  authorities as we have considered  relevant.  It should be noted that the
Code, the Regulations and such judicial authorities, rulings, and administrative
interpretations  and other authorities are subject to change at any time and, in
some  circumstances,  with retroactive  effect; and any such change could affect
the opinion stated herein.

         This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof based upon the facts and
law in  existence  on the date  hereof.  We  assume no  obligation  to update or
supplement this letter to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter
come to our  attention  with  respect to the  opinion and  statements  set forth
above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.

         We hereby  consent  to the  filing of this  letter as an exhibit to the
Current  Report  on Form  8-K  filed by  Hartford  Life in  connection  with the
issuance and sale of the Notes,  incorporated  by reference in the  Registration
Statement.  In giving such consent, we do not thereby concede that we are within
the category of persons whose consent is required  under Section 7 of the Act or
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

                                             Very truly yours,
