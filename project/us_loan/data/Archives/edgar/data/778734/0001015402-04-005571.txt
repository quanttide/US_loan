FAIRFIELD, NJ, DECEMBER 20, 2004 - Measurement Specialties, Inc. (AMEX: MSS), a

growth opportunities, strong margins and seasoned European management team make
this an excellent addition to our portfolio. For calendar 2004, Humirel will
post approximately $7.9 million in sales, a 64% increase over 2003. For MSI's
Fiscal 2006 (beginning April 05), we expect Humirel to contribute $12 million to
$15 million in sales and $2 million to $3 million in operating profit. Humirel's
proprietary technology offers customers a combination of low cost, durability
and high performance. Accordingly, we anticipate Humirel's annual growth rate
will significantly exceed that of our core sensor business for several years. We
will review the Humirel and recently announced MWS Sensorik acquisitions and
their impact to Fiscal 2006 in a conference call later today."
