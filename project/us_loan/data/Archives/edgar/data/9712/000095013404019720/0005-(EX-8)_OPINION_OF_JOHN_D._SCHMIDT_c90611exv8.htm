<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Vice President and Senior Tax Counsel of Principal Life Insurance Company (&#147;Principal
Life&#148;). I or other attorneys in the Law Department of Principal Life, under my supervision, have
reviewed the documents relating to the establishment of a program pursuant to which newly formed
common law trusts formed under the laws of the State of New York will issue notes, with each
trust&#146;s notes to be secured by a funding agreement (in the form filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (as defined below)) to be entered into between Principal Life and the
relevant Trust, and a guarantee issued by Principal Financial Group, Inc. (&#147;PFG&#148;) which fully and
unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations of Principal Life. Principal Life and PFG filed
a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-110499 and 333-110499-01) with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) on November&nbsp;14, 2003, as amended by Amendment No.&nbsp;1
filed with the Commission on December&nbsp;19, 2003 and Amendment No.&nbsp;2 filed with the Commission on
March&nbsp;3, 2004 (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
including a prospectus relating to the notes (the &#147;Prospectus&#148;), a prospectus supplement relating
to secured medium-term notes to be issued by the trusts (the &#147;Institutional Prospectus Supplement&#148;)
and a prospectus supplement relating to Principal<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Life CoreNotes<SUP>&#174;</SUP> to be
issued by the trusts (the &#147;Retail Prospectus Supplement&#148;). This opinion letter is delivered to you
in connection with the issuance by Principal Life Income Fundings Trust 2004-79 (the &#147;Trust&#148;) of
$749,000.00 aggregate principal amount of the Trust&#146;s 5.250% Principal<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Life
CoreNotes<SUP>&#174;</SUP> due 2019 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) and the delivery of Funding Agreement No.&nbsp;8-01862 by
Principal Life (the &#147;Funding Agreement&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furnishing this opinion, we have reviewed: (i)&nbsp;the Registration Statement, the Prospectus,
the Retail Prospectus Supplement and the pricing supplement dated December&nbsp;17, 2004 (the &#147;Pricing
Supplement&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the trust agreement, dated as of the date of the Pricing Supplement (the &#147;Trust
Agreement&#148;), which adopts and incorporates the standard trust terms dated March&nbsp;5, 2004, between
U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as trustee, and GSS Holdings II, Inc., as trust beneficial
owner, (iii)&nbsp;the indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), which adopts and incorporates the standard indenture
terms dated March&nbsp;5, 2004, between Citibank, N.A., as indenture trustee and the Trust, (iv)&nbsp;the
Distribution Agreement, dated March&nbsp;5, 2004 entered into by and among Principal Life, PFG and the
agents named therein, acknowledged and agreed to by the Trust pursuant to the terms agreement dated
as of the date of the Pricing Supplement executed by the Trust through the execution of the Omnibus
Instrument, (v)&nbsp;the Omnibus Instrument, dated December&nbsp;17, 2004, that includes the Trust Agreement
and the Indenture executed in connection with the creation of the Trust and the issuance by the
Trust of the Notes, (vi)&nbsp;the Closing Instrument, dated December&nbsp;22, 2004, (vii)&nbsp;the Notes, (viii)
the Funding Agreement, and (ix)&nbsp;the Guarantee, dated as of the Effective Date (as defined in the
Funding Agreement), executed by PFG.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set
forth herein, the discussion set forth in the Retail Prospectus Supplement under the heading
&#147;Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,&#148; to the extent describing matters of
United States federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, is my opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering the opinion set forth above, I have considered the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), regulations promulgated thereunder by the
United States Treasury Department (the &#147;Regulations&#148;), pertinent judicial authorities, rulings and
other administrative interpretations of the Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as
we have considered relevant. It should be noted that the Code, the Regulations and such judicial
authorities, rulings, and administrative interpretations and other authorities are subject to
change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect; and any such change could
affect the opinion stated herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof based upon the facts and law in existence on
the date hereof. I assume no obligation to update or supplement this letter to reflect any
circumstances which may hereafter come to my attention with respect to the opinion and statements
set forth above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.
