<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Principal Life Insurance Company
(&#147;Principal Life&#148;). I or other attorneys in the Law Department of Principal Life, under my
supervision, have reviewed the documents relating to the establishment of a program pursuant to
which newly formed common law trusts formed under the laws of the State of New York will issue
notes, with each trust&#146;s notes to be secured by a funding agreement (in the form filed as an
exhibit to the Registration Statement (as defined below)) to be entered into between Principal Life
and the relevant Trust, and a guarantee issued by Principal Financial Group, Inc. (&#147;PFG&#148;) which
fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations of Principal Life. Principal Life and
PFG filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-110499 and 333-110499-01) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) on November&nbsp;14, 2003, as amended by Amendment
No.&nbsp;1 filed with the Commission on December&nbsp;19, 2003 and Amendment No.&nbsp;2 filed with the Commission
on March&nbsp;3, 2004 (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
including a prospectus relating to the notes, a prospectus supplement relating to secured
medium-term notes to be issued by the trusts and a prospectus supplement relating to
Principal<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Life Core Notes<SUP>&#174;</SUP> to be issued by the trusts. This opinion letter
is delivered to you in connection with the issuance by Principal Life Income Fundings Trust 2004-79
(the &#147;Trust&#148;) of $749,000.00 aggregate principal amount of the Trust&#146;s 5.250% Principal<SUP>&#174;</SUP>
Life Core Notes<SUP>&#174; </SUP>due 2019 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) and the delivery of Funding Agreement No.
8-01562 by Principal Life (the &#147;Funding Agreement&#148;).

records, documents, certificates and other instruments that were necessary or appropriate to enable
me to render the opinion expressed below. In rendering the opinion expressed below, I have assumed
the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Funding Agreement by the parties thereto,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the
limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, I am of the opinion that:

Life enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or

creditors&#146; rights and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).</TD>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I express no opinion herein other than as to the law of the State of Iowa. This opinion is
rendered as of the date hereof and I assume no obligation to update or supplement this letter to
reflect any circumstances which may hereafter come to my attention with respect to the opinion and
statements set forth above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K

reference in the Registration Statement and to the use of my name in the Pricing Supplement. In
giving such consent, I do not thereby concede that I am within the category of persons whose
consent is required under Section&nbsp;7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder.
