       SECTION 4 - MATTERS RELATED TO ACCOUNTANTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ITEM 4.01         CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT


(a)  Previous independent registered public accounting firm.

     (i) Prior to its acquisition by Incentra  Solutions,  Inc.,  ManagedStorage
International,  Inc.  ("MSI")  engaged KPMG LLP on June 14, 2004,  to conduct an
audit of MSI's  financial  statements as of and for the year ended  December 31,
2003.  MSI is  considered  to be the  accounting  acquirer  in the  transaction,
consummated on August 18, 2004, whereby MSI became a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
the registrant. On October 28, 2004, KPMG LLP informed the registrant that, upon
the issuance of its audit report on  financial  statements  of MSI as of and for
the year ended  December 31, 2003,  KPMG LLP would not continue as the principal
accountants  for the  registrant.  As of the date of this filing,  the financial
statements of MSI and the related audit report have not been issued. As reported
in our Current  Report on Form 8-K dated  November 5, 2004,  we have engaged GHP
Horwath as our new independent  registered public accounting firm for the fiscal
year ending  December 31, 2004. The decision to change  accountants was approved
by our board of directors.

     (ii) Through December 23, 2004,  there were no disagreements  with KPMG LLP
on any  matter  of  accounting  principles  or  practices,  financial  statement
disclosure,  or  auditing  scope  or  procedures,  which  disagreements,  if not
resolved  to the  satisfaction  of KPMG  LLP,  would  have  caused  them to make
reference  in  connection  with  their  opinion  on the  subject  matter  of the
disagreement.

     (iii) Through December 23, 2004,  there were no reportable  events required
to be disclosed under paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv)(B) of Regulation S-B.

     (iv) The  registrant  has requested  that KPMG LLP furnish it with a letter
addressed to the Securities and Exchange  Commission  stating  whether or not it
agrees with the above  statements.  A copy of such letter is attached as Exhibit
16 hereto.


(b)  New independent accountants

     (i) As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated November
     5, 2004,  we have  engaged  GHP Horwath as our new  independent  registered
     public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004.

December 23, 2004

Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, D.C.  20549


Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are principal accountants for ManagedStorage International, Inc., who is
considered to be the accounting acquiror in the transaction, consummated on
August 18, 2004, whereby ManagedStorage International, Inc. became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Incentra Solutions, Inc. On October 28, 2004, we
informed Incentra Solutions, Inc. that we would not continue as the principal
accountant of ManagedStorage International, Inc. after the issuance of our
report on the financial statements of ManagedStorage International, Inc. as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2003. We have read Incentra Solutions,
Inc.'s statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K dated December 23,
2004, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to
agree or disagree with Incentra Solutions' statement that the change was
approved by the board of directors.

Very truly yours,


/s/ KPMG LLP
