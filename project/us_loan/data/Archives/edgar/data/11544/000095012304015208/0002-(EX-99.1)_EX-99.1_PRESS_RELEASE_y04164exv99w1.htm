<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING<BR>
INDUSTRY REGULATORY INFORMATION REQUESTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Greenwich, CT, December&nbsp;23, 2004 &#151; W. R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE: BER) </B>today announced
that, as previously disclosed, W. R. Berkley Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) had retained outside legal
counsel to conduct an internal investigation following the announcement by the New York Attorney
General&#146;s Office of its investigation into alleged anti-competitive activities in the insurance
industry. The Company commenced this internal investigation at its own initiative, not as a result
of any specific inquiry. Although the internal investigation is ongoing, outside legal counsel
have interviewed a number of employees and reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since commencing its internal investigation, the Company and certain of its operating units,
like many others in the insurance industry, have received information requests from various state
insurance regulators and other state authorities. These requests, for the most part, relate to
inquiries into inappropriate solicitation activities, producer compensation practices and the
underwriting of legal malpractice insurance. We are responding to each of these inquiries and are
cooperating with the applicable regulatory authorities. As a result of our investigation, a single
insurance operating unit reported certain limited instances of conduct which could be characterized
as involving inappropriate solicitation practices. To address these limited instances, the Company
has implemented certain additional internal procedures and is taking other corrective action.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded in 1967, W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that operates in
five segments of the property casualty insurance business: specialty insurance, regional property
casualty insurance, alternative markets, reinsurance and international.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a &#147;Safe Harbor&#148; Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Any forward-looking statements contained herein, including statements related to our outlook
for the industry and for our performance for the year 2004 and beyond, are based upon the Company&#146;s
historical performance and on current plans, estimates and expectations. The inclusion of this
forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person
that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. They are
subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the cyclical nature of
the property casualty industry, the long-tail and potentially volatile nature of the reinsurance
business, product demand and pricing, claims development and the process of estimating reserves,
the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts, increases in the level of our retention,
natural and man-made catastrophic losses, including as a result of terrorist activities, the impact
of competition, the availability of reinsurance, the ability of our reinsurers to pay reinsurance
recoverables owed to us, investment risks, including those relating to fixed income securities,
merger arbitrage investments, and other equity securities, exchange rate and political risks
relating to our international operations, legislative and regulatory developments, including
potential regulatory or legal actions arising from the Company&#146;s conduct of business practices,
changes in the ratings assigned to us by ratings agencies, the availability of dividends from our
insurance company subsidiaries, our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and
invest in new insurance ventures, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and other
risks detailed from time to time in the Company&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These risks could cause actual results of the industry or our actual results for the
year 2004 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement
made by or on behalf of the Company. Any projections of growth in the Company&#146;s net premiums
written and management fees would not necessarily result in commensurate levels of underwriting and
operating profits. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made,
and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
