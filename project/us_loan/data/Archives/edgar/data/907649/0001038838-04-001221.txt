              ITEM 1.01--ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 24, 2004, FX Energy, Inc. adopted a restated 401(k) stock
bonus plan effective January 1, 2004.

         The 401(k) stock bonus plan covers all eligible employees employed by
FX Energy on the applicable plan entry dates that have completed 90 days of
continuous service. All employees, except those that are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement that does not provide for participation in the plan, that
have not reached at least 21 years of age, or that are designated by FX Energy
to be a consultant, independent contractor, or leased employee, are eligible to
participate as of a plan entry date nearest their date of hire, which is the
first day of each calendar quarter.

         The 401(k) plan provides for voluntary compensation deferrals between
1% and 100% of annual eligible compensation, subject to a maximum limit allowed
under the Internal Revenue Code, which is subject to adjustment for cost of
living increases. Each pay period, FX Energy will make a matching contribution
to each participant's account in an amount to be determined at the discretion of
FX Energy, but not to exceed 25% of a participant's contribution, subject to the
limitations that the combined allocation of all deferrals and contributions may
not exceed a maximum limit allowed under the Internal Revenue Code, which is
subject to adjustment for cost of living increases in future years.

         Prior to normal retirement at age 65, FX Energy's profit sharing and
matching contributions vest 100% after three years of service. In addition,
participants will become vested in the balance of their profit-sharing
contribution account attributable to profit-sharing contributions after January
1, 2004, at a graduated vesting schedule over three years, except in the case of
death, disability, or reaching age 65 while employed, in which instances such
contributions are fully vested.

         FX Energy may make additional discretionary contributions to the
accounts of plan participants at the end of each plan year, which are subject to
the same vesting rules as matching contributions. Participant compensation
deferrals and rollover contributions accepted by the 401(k) plan are at all
times fully vested.

         The trustee under the 401(k) plan, at the direction of each
participant, invests the assets of the 401(k) plan, except for nonelective
contributions of FX Energy securities, in any of a number of investment options
allowable under the standardized prototype plan. Participants are eligible for a
distribution from the 401(k) plan upon reaching age 59-1/2, reaching age 65
(normal retirement), death, disability, or separation from service with FX
Energy, in the form of a lump sum payment or installments.

         On December 24, 2004, FX Energy contributed 21,893 shares of common
stock as a discretionary, nonelective contribution, allocated among plan
participants as follows:
