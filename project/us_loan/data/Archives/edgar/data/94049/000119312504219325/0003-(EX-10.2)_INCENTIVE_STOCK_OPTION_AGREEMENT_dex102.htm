Incentive Stock Option to purchase a total of <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> shares of common stock of the Company (&#147;Common Stock&#148;). The option price of each share of Common Stock subject to
this Agreement shall be $<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>. The right to exercise the option shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, shall not be exercisable until
the Participant completes two (2) years of employment with the Company following the date first written above and shall expire at the earliest of ten (10) years after the date first written above; the date established by the Compensation and
