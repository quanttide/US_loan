 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MORTGAGE LOAN POOL AND THE MORTGAGED PROPERTIES(1)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On December 21, 2004, Citicorp Mortgage Securities, Inc. ("CMSI")
transferred to the Trustee, U.S. Bank National Association, mortgage loans with
an aggregate scheduled principal balance outstanding (after deducting principal
payments due on or before December 1, 2004) as of December 1, 2004 of
$572,678,710.94. The mortgage loans that have original maturities of at least 20
but not more than 30 years, the "pool I mortgage loans", have an aggregate
scheduled principal balance outstanding (after deducting principal payments due
on or before December 1, 2004) as of December 1, 2004 of $472,766,861.10. The
mortgage loans that have original maturities of 15 years, the "pool II mortgage
loans", have an aggregate scheduled principal balance outstanding (after
deducting principal payments due on or before December 1, 2004) as of December
1, 2004 of $99,911,849.84. The mortgage loans were delivered in exchange for the
certificates, authenticated by the paying agent, evidencing 100% of the regular
interests in the Trust. Distributions on the certificates will be made by
Citibank, N.A., as paying agent, by wire transfer or by such other means as the
person entitled thereto and CMSI shall agree. CMSI may repurchase all mortgage
loans remaining in the mortgage loan pool pursuant to the pooling agreement if
at the time of repurchase the aggregate scheduled principal balance of such
mortgage loans is less than $57,267,871.09. Information below is provided with
respect to the pool I mortgage loans, the pool II mortgage loans and/or all
mortgage loans included in the mortgage loan pool as indicated.

     The total numbers of the pool I mortgage loans, the pool II mortgage loans
and all mortgage loans as of December 1, 2004 were 925, 185 and 1,110,
respectively. The weighted average interest rates of the pool I mortgage loans,
the pool II mortgage loans and all mortgage loans (before deduction of the
servicing fee) as of December 1, 2004 were 6.044%, 5.483% and 5.946%,
respectively. The weighted average remaining terms to stated maturity of the
pool I mortgage loans, the pool II mortgage loans and all mortgage loans as of
December 1, 2004 were 357.35 months, 178.16 months and 326.09 months,
respectively. All mortgage loans have original maturities of at least 15 but not
more than 30 years. None of the pool I mortgage loans or the pool II mortgage
loans were originated prior to March 1, 2003 and May 1, 2003, respectively, or
after December 1, 2004. The weighted average original terms to stated maturity
of the pool I mortgage loans, the pool II mortgage loans and all mortgage loans
as of December 1, 2004 were 359.06 months, 180.00 months and 327.82 months,
respectively.

     None of the pool I mortgage loans have a scheduled maturity later than

$35,000 respectively, nor more than $1,000,000 and $1,495,000, respectively. No
pool II mortgage loans, as of December 1, 2004, had loan-to-value ratios at
origination in excess of 80%. Pool I mortgage loans having an aggregate
scheduled principal balance of $6,469,784, as of December 1, 2004, had
loan-to-value ratios at origination in excess of 80%, but no pool I mortgage
loans had loan-to-value ratios in excess of 95%. The weighted average
loan-to-value ratios at origination of the pool I mortgage loans, the pool II

mortgage loans are secured by Mortgaged Properties located in any one zip code.

     At least 95%(2), 90% and 94%, respectively, of the pool I mortgage loans,
the pool II mortgage loans and all mortgage loans, are secured by mortgaged
properties determined by CitiMortgage, Inc. to be the primary residence of the

stated income loan underwriting policies that do not require proof of the
prospective borrower's income as stated on the loan application but do require
telephone verification of employment and may also require proof of liquid
assets. No more than 9%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of the pool I mortgage
loans, the pool II mortgage loans and all mortgage loans will be mortgage loans
