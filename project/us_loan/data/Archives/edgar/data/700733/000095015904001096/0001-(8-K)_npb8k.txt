Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Change in Fiscal
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year.
- ----

         On December 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of National Penn
Bancshares, Inc. approved amendments to National Penn's Bylaws.

         The purpose of the amendments is to provide flexibility for the Board
to delegate to a Board Committee the power to elect officers other than the
Chairman or President. As before the amendments, the full Board designates
either the Chairman or the President as the Chief Executive Officer. The
amendments were effective upon adoption by the Board.

         The Bylaws, as amended, are filed in this Report as Exhibit 3.1.
Amended sections are indicated (sections 4.03, 4.08, 4.11, 4.12).

Item 5.05 Amendments to the Registrant's Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provision of the Code of Ethics
- -------------------------------

         On December 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of National Penn approved
amendments to National Penn's Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is National
Penn's code of conduct required by the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock
Market and the code of ethics required by Section 406(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The principal purpose of the amendments is to provide expressly that
temporary employees and consultants are subject to the Code. Previously, such
persons were deemed covered by the Code as being within the definition of
"agents". In addition, other changes were made to the Code regarding personal
investments, compliance with National Penn policies and procedures, and
cooperation with investigations. None of the changes related to any element of
the code of ethics required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the related SEC
regulations. The amendments were effective upon adoption by the Board.

         The Code of Conduct, as amended, is filed in this Report as Exhibit
14.1. Amended sections are indicated.

Item 8.01 Other Events
- ----------------------

         On December 22, 2004, the Board of Directors approved Amendment No. 8
to the National Penn Capital Accumulation Plan, a 401(k) plan.

         The purpose of this amendment is to merge The Peoples Bank of Oxford
401(k) Retirement Plan into the National Penn Capital Accumulation Plan
effective December 13, 2004.

         The National Penn Capital Accumulation Plan (Amended and Restated
Effective January 1, 1997) and Amendments No. 1 through No. 5 to that Plan were
included in National Penn's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as Exhibits 10.6 through 10.11, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2004. Amendments No. 6 through 8 to the
Capital Accumulation Plan are filed in this Report as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and
10.3, respectively.
