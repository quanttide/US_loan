ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.

On December 20, 2004, Fresh Choice, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Fresh Choice"
or "our"), filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of California (the "Bankruptcy Court") its Monthly Operating Report for
Debtors-in-Possession and Chapter 11 Trustees for the period ended November 28,
2004 (the "Report").

The Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Cautionary Statement
- --------------------
         Fresh Choice cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon the
information contained in the Report, which contains unaudited information and is
in a format prescribed by bankruptcy law. The Report is not prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and does not
accurately reflect our condition on a GAAP basis. The Report is not presented on
a consolidated basis and does not present the consolidated results of Fresh
Choice. The Report also contains information for periods that may be shorter or
otherwise different than those contained in reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act"). As such, the statements are not comparable with the
consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC. The Report may also be
subject to revision. Such information may not be indicative of Fresh Choice's
financial condition or operating results and readers are cautioned to refer to
our SEC filings.

Safe Harbor Forward-Looking Statements
- --------------------------------------
         Certain statements set forth in this current report on Form 8-K or in
the Report, including forecasts of future monthly expenditures, constitute
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Report, as well as other statements made by
Fresh Choice, may contain forward-looking statements that reflect, when made,
Fresh Choice's current views with respect to current events and financial
performance. Forward-looking statements are denoted by such words as "may,"
"will," "expect," "believe," "plan" "forecast," "post-petition" and other
similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the
case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to the
Fresh Choice's operations and business environment which may cause the actual
results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied,
by such forward-looking statements. Fresh Choice undertakes no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. In addition to the risks discussed
under the heading "Business - Business Risks" in our most recent Form 10-K and
Form 10-Q, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

    o   our ability to continue as a going concern;
    o   our ability to return to positive comparable-store sales;
    o   our ability to operate restaurants profitably;
    o   our ability to obtain vendor or debtor-in-possession financing;
    o   our ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions in the
        Chapter 11 proceeding prosecuted by it from time to time;
    o   our ability to develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate one or
        more plans of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 case;
    o   risks associated with third parties seeking to propose and confirm one
        or more plans of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 case;
    o   risks associated with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee and
        the ability of the Chapter 11 trustee to successfully manage our
        day-to-day operations;
    o   risks associated with the Chapter 11 trustee or third parties
        seeking to convert the case to a Chapter 7 case;
    o   our ability to obtain and maintain normal terms with vendors
        and service providers;
    o   our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;
    o   the potential adverse impact of Chapter 11 on our liquidity or
        results of operations;
    o   our ability to fund and execute our business plan;
    o   our ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and
        associates; and
    o   our ability to attract and retain customers.

                                       2

       Similarly, these and other factors, including the terms of any
reorganization plan ultimately confirmed, can affect the value of the Fresh
Choice's various pre-petition liabilities, common stock and/or other equity
securities. No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies.
Accordingly, Fresh Choice urges that the appropriate caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any of these liabilities and/or
securities.

         The Report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed
incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such filing.

Notes:

(1)  The Debtor's financial statements are not maintained on a calendar month
     end, they are maintained by period -- each with 4 weeks. The financial
     statements represented in this Monthly Operating Report cover the four-week
     period from November 1, 2004 through November 28, 2004. The petition was
     filed on July 12, 2004, so all of the activity is post-petition.

(2)  On July 12, 2004 and July 14, 2004, this court entered certain orders
     authorizing, but not requiring, the debtor to pay certain pre- petition
     obligations including: accrued employee wages, salaries and contributions
     to employee benefit's plan, the debtor's share of certain payroll taxes,
     pre-petition sales, use and similar taxes in the ordinary course of
     business. I declare under penalty of perjury I have reviewed the above
     summary and attached financial statements, and after making reasonable
     inquiry believe these documents are correct.

(a)  List total amount of claims even it under secured.

(b)  Estimated amount of claim to be allowed after compromise or litigation. As
     an example, you are a defendant in a lawsuit alleging damage of $10,000,000
     and a proof of claim is filed in that amount. You believe that you can
     settle the case for a claim of $3,000,000. For Schedule F reporting
     purposes you should list $10,000,000 as the Claimed Amount and $3,000,000
     as the Allowed Amount.
