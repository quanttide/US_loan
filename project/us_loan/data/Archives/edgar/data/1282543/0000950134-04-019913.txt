Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;21, 2004, Affirmative Insurance Holdings Statutory Trust I, a
Delaware statutory trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;), the newly formed, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;), issued
$30,000,000 of trust preferred securities (the &#147;Capital Securities&#148;) in a
private placement pursuant to an applicable exemption from registration. The
Capital Securities mature on March&nbsp;15, 2035, but may be redeemed at the
Company&#146;s option beginning on March&nbsp;15, 2010. The Capital Securities require
quarterly distributions by the Trust to the holder of the Capital Securities,
initially at a fixed rate of 7.545% per annum for five years, and thereafter at
a variable rate which will reset quarterly at the three-month LIBOR rate plus
3.60%. Distributions are cumulative and will accrue from the date of original
issuance but may be deferred by the Company for up to 20 consecutive quarterly
periods. The Company has irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the Capital
Securities pursuant to a guarantee agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to
this Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item
2.03.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The proceeds of the Capital Securities received by the Trust, along with
proceeds of $928,000 received by the Trust from the issuance of common
securities (the &#147;Common Securities&#148;) by the Trust to the Company, will be used
to purchase $30,928,000 of the Company&#146;s junior subordinated debt securities
(the &#147;Debt Securities&#148;), issued pursuant to an indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;)
entered into between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the
&#147;Trustee&#148;). The proceeds of the Debt Securities will be used to increase the
Company&#146;s policyholders surplus to approximately $135,000,000.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Debt Securities mature on March&nbsp;15, 2035, but the Company may redeem the
Debt Securities, in whole or in part, beginning on March&nbsp;15, 2010 in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture. The Debt Securities bear interest at a
fixed rate of 7.545% per annum for five years, and thereafter at a variable
rate which will reset quarterly at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.60%.
Interest is cumulative and will accrue from the date of original issuance but
may be deferred by the Company for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Early Redemption. </B>The Capital Securities and Debt Securities may be redeemed at
the option of the Company beginning on March&nbsp;15, 2010, and may be redeemed
earlier following the occurrence of a Special Event. &#147;Special Event&#148; is defined
in the transaction documents as either:

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>THROUGH TRUST PREFERRED OFFERING</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ADDISON, Texas (December&nbsp;21, 2004) </B>&#150; Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc.
(Nasdaq: AFFM) announced today that its newly formed Delaware trust subsidiary,
Affirmative Insurance Holdings Statutory Trust I, has completed a private
placement of $30.0&nbsp;million in 30-year floating rate trust preferred securities.
Proceeds of the offering will be contributed to Affirmative Insurance Company&#146;s
policyholders surplus, which will increase to approximately $135.0&nbsp;million.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;The increase to our insurance company&#146;s capital base resulting from the
proceeds of this offering will allow Affirmative to retain attractively
margined business that we would otherwise cede to reinsurers,&#148; said Thomas E.
Mangold, president and chief executive officer of Affirmative Insurance
Holdings, Inc.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The trust preferred securities, which can be redeemed in whole or in part by
the issuer after five years, bear an initial interest rate of 7.545&nbsp;percent
until December&nbsp;15, 2009, at which time the securities will adjust quarterly to
the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 3.6&nbsp;percentage points.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
offer to buy the trust preferred securities or any other securities.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE INSURANCE HOLDINGS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Headquartered in Addison, Texas, Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc., is a
producer and provider of non-standard automobile insurance policies to
individual consumers in highly targeted geographic markets. Affirmative

circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The duties and responsibilities of the Trustees and the Administrators

provision of this Declaration shall require any Trustee or Administrator to

performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity satisfactory to it against such
risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein
expressly so provided, every provision of this Declaration relating to the
conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees

any of the Securities shall cease to be such Administrator before the
Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates
nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates
had not ceased to be such Administrator. Any Certificate may be signed on
behalf of the Trust by such person who, at the actual date of execution of such

execution and delivery of the Declaration any such person was not such an
Administrator. A Capital Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the
manual signature of an Authorized Officer of the Institutional Trustee. Such
signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Capital Security has been
authenticated under this Declaration. Upon written order of the Trust signed by
one Administrator, the Institutional Trustee shall authenticate the Capital
Securities for original issue. The Institutional Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent that is a U.S. Person acceptable to the Trust to
authenticate the Capital Securities. A Common Security need not be so
authenticated and shall be valid upon execution by one or more Administrators.

temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Administrators shall
prepare and, in the case of the Capital Securities, the Institutional Trustee
shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities.

forward to the Institutional Trustee any Securities surrendered to it for
registration of transfer, redemption or payment. The Institutional Trustee
shall promptly cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer,
payment, replacement or cancellation and shall dispose of such canceled
Securities in accordance with its standard procedures or otherwise as the
Administrators direct. The Administrators may not issue new Securities to
replace Securities that have been paid or that have been delivered to the

Institutional Trustee, subject to the provisions hereof, fails to annul any
such acceleration and waive such default, the Holders of not less than a
Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to
the Institutional Trustee, the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind
and annul such acceleration and its consequences if:

arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this
Declaration, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default

or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

of the fact that such Person is or was an Indemnified Person against expenses
(including attorneys&#146; fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Person in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding if such Person acted in good faith and in a
manner such Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,

create a presumption that the Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which such Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to

proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.

permitted by law, any Indemnified Person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure
a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such Person is
or was an Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys&#146;
fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by such Person
in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit
if such Person acted in good faith and in a manner such Person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made
in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of
Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall
deem proper.

admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;of this Section
9.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such
Person shall be indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted by

counsel in a written opinion or (C)&nbsp;by the Common Security Holder
of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the
Administrators, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time
such determination is made, such Indemnified Person acted in bad
faith or in a manner that such Person either believed to be opposed

deliberately breached such Person&#146;s duty to the Trust or its Common

Holdings Statutory Trust I (the &#147;Trust&#148;), with an aggregate stated liquidation
amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of Thirty Million Dollars
($30,000,000) and a stated liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the
Trust of $1,000 per Capital Security (the &#147;Capital Securities&#148;). The Capital
Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially
in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions
thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or
practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital
Securities are listed, if any.

Securities&#148;) will be evidenced by Common Security Certificates substantially in
the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions
thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or
practice. In the absence of an Event of Default, the Common Securities will
have an aggregate stated liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the
Trust of Nine Hundred Twenty Eight Thousand Dollars ($928,000) and a stated
liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $1,000 per Common
Security.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Distributions. (a)&nbsp;Distributions payable on each Security will be
payable at a fixed rate of 7.545% (the &#147;Fixed Rate&#148;) per annum from December
21, 2004 until December&nbsp;15, 2009 (the &#147;Fixed Rate Period&#148;) and thereafter at a
variable per annum rate of interest, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR, as
determined on the LIBOR Determination Date for such Distribution Payment
Period, plus 3.60% (the &#147;Variable Rate&#148;) of the stated liquidation amount of
$1,000 per Security, (provided, however, that the Variable Rate for any
Distribution Payment Period may not exceed the highest rate permitted by New
York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general
applicability). The Coupon Rate (defined to include the Fixed Rate and
Variable Rate, as applicable, shall equal the rate of interest payable on the
Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Except as set forth below
in respect of an Extension Period, Distributions in arrears for more than one
quarterly period will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the
applicable Coupon Rate for each such quarterly period (to the extent permitted
by applicable law). The term &#147;Distributions&#148; as used herein includes cash
distributions, any such compounded distributions and any Additional Interest
payable on the Debentures unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable
only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by

months and the amount payable for any partial period shall be computed on the
basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Upon expiration of the Fixed Rate Period, distributions will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the relevant

obtained by the Calculation Agent for three-month U.S. Dollar
deposits in Europe, which appears on Telerate Page 3750 (as defined
in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 2000
Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Definitions) or such other page
as may replace such Telerate Page 3750, as of 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (London
time) on such LIBOR Determination Date, as reported by Bloomberg
Financial Markets Commodities News or any successor service. &#147;LIBOR
Business Day&#148; means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other
day on which commercial banking institutions in New York, New York
or Wilmington, Delaware are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to be closed. If such rate is superseded on

determined by the Calculation Agent) by reference to requests for
quotations as of approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (London time) on the
LIBOR Determination Date made by the Calculation Agent to the
Reference Banks. If, on any LIBOR Determination Date, at least two

such a quotation, LIBOR shall be deemed to be the arithmetic mean

Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall
be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Capital Securities.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) If the Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives
a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued
if the Debentures are redeemed as set out in this Section&nbsp;4 (which
notice will be irrevocable), then, provided, that the Institutional
Trustee has a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the
related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional
Trustee will pay the price payable upon redemption of the
Securities to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the
address of each such Holder appearing on the books and records of
the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution
Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
deposit, Distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so
called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such Securities
so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the
Holders of such Securities to receive the applicable price
specified in Section&nbsp;4(a). If any date of redemption of Securities
is not a Business Day, then payment of any such price payable on
such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a
Business Day except that, if such Business Day falls in the next
calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect
as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the
Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly
withheld or refused and not paid either by the Trust or by the
Debenture Issuer as guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee,
Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue at the
then applicable rate from the original redemption date to the
actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will
be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of
calculating the price payable upon redemption of the Capital
Securities. The Trust shall not be required to (i)&nbsp;issue, register
the transfer of or exchange any Security during a period beginning
at the opening of business 15&nbsp;days before any selection for
redemption of the Capital Securities and ending at the close of
business on the earliest date on which the relevant notice of
redemption is deemed to have been given to all Holders of the
Capital Securities to be so redeemed or (ii)&nbsp;register the transfer
of or exchange any Capital Securities so selected for redemption,
in whole or in part, except for the unredeemed portion of any
Capital Securities being redeemed in part.

to the Institutional Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon
the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct

provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would
require the consent or act of the holders of greater than a simple majority in
principal amount of Debentures (a &#147;Super Majority&#148;) affected thereby, the
Institutional Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the
written direction of the Holders of not less than the proportion in liquidation
amount of the Capital Securities outstanding which the relevant Super Majority
represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding. If
the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures

Securities have so directed the Institutional Trustee, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, a Holder of the Capital Securities may institute a legal
proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional
Trustee&#146;s rights under the Debentures without first instituting any legal
proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other person or entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture
Issuer to pay interest or premium, if any, on or principal of the Debentures on
the date the interest premium, if any, or principal is payable (or in the case
of redemption, the redemption date), then a Holder of record of the Capital
Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment, on
or after the respective due dates specified in the Debentures, to such Holder
directly of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Debentures

of the Capital Securities of such Holder. The Institutional Trustee shall
notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any default actually known to
the Institutional Trustee with respect to the Debentures unless (x)&nbsp;such
default has been cured prior to the giving of such notice or (y)&nbsp;the

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">&#091;FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY&#093;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be payable at a fixed
rate of 7.545% (the &#147;Fixed Rate&#148;) per annum from December&nbsp;21, 2004 until
December&nbsp;15, 2009 (the &#147;Fixed Rate Period&#148;) and thereafter at a variable per
annum rate of interest, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR (as defined in the
Declaration) plus 3.60% (the &#147;Variable Rate&#148;) of the stated liquidation amount
of $1,000 per Capital Security (provided, however, that the Coupon Rate,
defined to included the Fixed Rate and Variable Rate, as applicable, for any
Distribution Payment Period may not exceed the highest rate permitted by New
York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general
applicability), such Coupon Rate being the rate of interest payable on the
Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears
for more than one quarterly period will bear interest thereon compounded
quarterly at the then applicable Coupon Rate for each such quarterly period (to
the extent permitted by applicable law). The term &#147;Distributions&#148; as used
herein includes cash distributions, any such compounded distributions and any
Additional Interest payable on the Debentures unless otherwise stated. A
Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of
the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the
Institutional Trustee has funds legally available in the Property Account
therefor. During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of Distributions payable for
any period will be computed for any full quarterly Distribution period on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the amount payable for any
partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Upon expiration of the Fixed Rate
Period, distributions will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the
actual number of days elapsed in the relevant Distribution Payment Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital
Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance
and will be payable quarterly in arrears on March&nbsp;15, June&nbsp;15, September&nbsp;15 and
December&nbsp;15 of each year, commencing on March&nbsp;15, 2005 (each, a &#147;Distribution
Payment Date&#148;). Upon submission of Notice, the Debenture Issuer has the right
under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by
extending the interest payment period for up to 20 consecutive quarterly
periods (each such extended interest payment period together with all previous
and future consecutive extensions thereof, is referred to herein as an
&#147;Extension Period&#148;) at any time and from time to time on the Debentures,
subject to the conditions described below, and in the Declaration and the
Indenture, during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable
(except any Additional Interest that may be due and payable). During any
Extension Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and
interest on such accrued interest (such accrued interest and interest thereon
referred to herein as &#147;Deferred Interest&#148;) will accrue at an annual rate equal
to the Coupon Rate in effect for each such Extension Period, compounded
quarterly from the date such Deferred Interest would have been payable were it
not for the Extension Period, to the extent permitted by law. No Extension
Period may end on a date other than a Distribution Payment Date. At the end of
any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer shall pay all Deferred Interest
then accrued and unpaid on the Debentures; provided, however, that no Extension
Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or Special
Redemption Date. Prior to the termination of any Extension Period, the
Debenture Issuer may further extend such Extension Period, provided, that such
period together with all such previous and further consecutive extensions
thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the
Maturity Date. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the
payment of all Deferred Interest, the

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Debenture Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the
foregoing requirements. No interest or Deferred Interest (except any Additional
Amounts that may be due and payable) shall be due and payable during an
Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but Deferred Interest shall accrue
upon each installment of interest that would otherwise have been due and
payable during such Extension Period until such installment is paid. If
Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on the date
that the related Extension Period terminates to Holders of the Securities as
they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the record date
immediately preceding such date. Distributions on the Securities must be paid
on the dates payable (after giving effect to any Extension Period) to the
extent that the Trust has funds legally available for the payment of such
distributions in the Property Account of the Trust. The Trust&#146;s funds available
for Distribution to the Holders of the Securities will be limited to payments
received from the Debenture Issuer. The payment of Distributions out of moneys
held by the Trust is guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmative Insurance Holdings Statutory Trust I, a statutory trust
created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the &#147;Trust&#148;), hereby certifies
that Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc. (the &#147;Holder&#148;) is the registered
owner of 928 common securities of the Trust representing undivided beneficial
interests in the assets of the Trust (liquidation amount $1,000 per Common
Security)(the &#147;Common Securities&#148;). The Common Securities represented hereby
are issued pursuant to, and the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions,
preferences and other terms and provisions of the Common Securities shall in
all respects be subject to, the provisions of the Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust of the Trust, dated as of December&nbsp;21, 2004 among Timothy
A. Bienek and David B. Snyder, as Administrators, Chase Manhattan Bank USA,

Institutional Trustee, the Holder, as Sponsor, and the holders from time to
time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust, including
the designation of the terms of the Common Securities as set forth in Annex I

is continuing, the rights of Holder of Common Securities to payment in respect
of Distributions and payments upon Liquidation, redemption or otherwise are
subordinated to the rights of payment of holders of the Capital Securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acceptance of this Certificate, the Holder is bound by the Declaration
and is entitled to the benefits thereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acceptance of this Certificate, the Holder agrees to treat, for United

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">&#091;FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY&#093;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions payable on each Common Security will be identical in amount
to the Distributions payable on each Capital Security, which is at a fixed rate
of 7.545% (the &#147;Fixed Rate&#148;) per annum from <U>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</U><U>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</U>, 2004 until
December&nbsp;15, 2009 (the &#147;Fixed Rate Period&#148;) and thereafter at a variable per
annum rate of interest, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR (as defined in the
Declaration) plus 3.60% (the &#147;Variable Rate&#148;) of the stated liquidation amount
of $1,000 per Capital Security (provided, however, that the Coupon Rate,
defined to include the Fixed Rate and Variable Rate, as applicable, for any
Distribution Payment Period may not exceed the highest rate permitted by New
York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general
applicability), such Coupon Rate being the rate of interest payable on the
Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears
for more than one quarterly period will bear interest thereon compounded
quarterly at the then applicable Coupon Rate for each such quarterly period (to
the extent permitted by applicable law). The term &#147;Distributions&#148; as used
herein includes cash distributions, any such compounded distributions and any
Additional Interest payable on the Debentures unless otherwise stated. A
Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of
the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the
Institutional Trustee has funds legally available in the Property Account
therefor. During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of Distributions payable for
any period will be computed for any quarterly Distribution period on the basis
of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the amount payable for any
partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Upon expiration of the Fixed Rate
Period, the amount of distributions payable for any full quarterly Distribution
period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed in the relevant Distribution Payment Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Common
Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance
and will be payable quarterly in arrears on March&nbsp;15, June&nbsp;15, September&nbsp;15 and
December&nbsp;15 of each year, commencing on March&nbsp;15, 2005 (each, a &#147;Distribution
Payment Date&#148;). Upon submission of Notice, the Debenture Issuer has the right
under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by
extending the interest payment period for up to 20 consecutive quarterly
periods (each such extended interest payment period, together with all previous
and future consecutive extensions thereof, is referred to herein as an
&#147;Extension Period&#148;) at any time and from time to time on the Debentures,
subject to the conditions described below and in the Declaration and the
Indenture, during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable
(except any Additional Interest that may be due and payable). During any
Extension Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and
interest on such accrued interest (such accrued interest and interest thereon
referred to herein as &#147;Deferred Interest&#148;) will accrue at an annual rate equal
to the Coupon Rate in effect for each such Extension Period, compounded
quarterly from the date such Deferred Interest would have been payable were it
not for the Extension Period, to the extent permitted by law. No Extension
Period may end on a date other than a Distribution Payment Date. At the end of
any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer shall pay all Deferred Interest
then accrued and unpaid on the Debentures; provided, however, that no Extension
Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date, and Redemption Date or Special
Redemption Date. Prior to the termination of any Extension Period, the
Debenture Issuer may further extend such Extension Period, provided, that such
period together with all such previous and further consecutive extensions
thereof shall

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the Maturity
Date. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all
Deferred Interest, the Debenture Issuer may commence a new Extension Period,
subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest or Deferred Interest shall
be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but
Deferred Interest shall accrue upon each installment of interest that would
otherwise have been due and payable during such Extension Period until such
installment is paid. If Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall
be paid on the date that the related Extension Period terminates to Holders of
the Securities as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the
record date immediately preceding such date.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions on the Securities must be paid on the dates payable (after
giving effect to any Extension Period) to the extent that the Trust has funds
legally available for the payment of such distributions in the Property Account
of the Trust. The Trust&#146;s funds legally available for Distribution to the
Holders of the Securities will be limited to payments received from the
Debenture Issuer. The payment of Distributions out of moneys held by the Trust
is guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Common Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the Declaration.

of subparagraph (a)(1), (2), (3), (7)&nbsp;or (8)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;501 under the Securities

cases in accordance with any applicable state securities laws and any
requirements of law that govern the disposition of our property. If any resale
or other transfer of the Capital Securities is proposed to be made pursuant to
clause (c)&nbsp;or (e)&nbsp;above, the transferor shall deliver a letter from the
transferee substantially in the form of this letter to the Institutional
Trustee as Transfer Agent, which shall provide as applicable, among other

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;We acknowledge that each Plan, by its purchase of the Capital
Securities, will be deemed to have directed the Trust to invest in the junior

In case any Debt Security which has matured or is about to mature or has been
called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or
stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Debt Security, pay or
authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case
of a mutilated Debt Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish
to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by
them to save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft,

execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery
temporary Debt Securities that are typed, printed or lithographed. Temporary
Debt Securities shall be issuable in any authorized denomination, and
substantially in the form of the definitive Debt Securities but with such
omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Debt
Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Debt
Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee
upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the
same effect, as the definitive Debt Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the
Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent
definitive Debt Securities and thereupon any or all temporary Debt Securities
may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the Principal Office of the Trustee
or at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose as
provided in Section&nbsp;3.02, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall
authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary
Debt Securities a like aggregate principal amount of such definitive Debt
Securities. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and
without any charge therefor except that in case of any such exchange involving
a registration of transfer the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto. Until so exchanged, the temporary Debt Securities shall in all
respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive
Debt Securities authenticated and delivered hereunder.

Period, the original date of issuance of such Debt Security to, but excluding,
the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or, in the case of the last Interest
Payment Period, the Redemption Date, Special Redemption Date or Maturity Date,

which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on
each such Debt Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same
time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or
shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit
prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held
in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as
in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date
for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than fifteen
nor less than ten days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less
than ten days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed
payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name
and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment
of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed,
first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder at his or her address as it
appears in the Debt Security Register, not less than ten days prior to such
special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest
and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such
Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Debt
Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such

the interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months and the amount payable for any partial period shall be computed on the
basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Upon expiration of the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for
any Interest Payment Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
the actual number of days elapsed in the relevant interest period; provided, however, that upon the occurrence
of a Special Event Redemption pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.02 the amounts payable
pursuant to this Indenture shall be calculated as set forth in the definition
of Special Redemption Price.

the next preceding LIBOR Business Day that is also a LIBOR Banking
Day) prior to March&nbsp;15, June&nbsp;15, September&nbsp;15 and December&nbsp;15,
(except, with respect to the first Interest Period, on March&nbsp;15,
2010), (each such day, a &#147;LIBOR Determination Date&#148;), LIBOR shall
equal the rate, as obtained by the Calculation Agent for three-month
U.S. Dollar deposits in Europe, which appears on Telerate Page 3750
(as defined in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
Inc. 2000 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Definitions) or such
other page as may replace such Page 3750, as of 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (London
time) on such LIBOR Determination Date, as reported by Bloomberg
Financial Markets Commodities News or any successor service. &#147;LIBOR
Business Day&#148; means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other
day on which commercial banking institutions in New York, New York or
Wilmington, Delaware are authorized or obligated by law or executive
order to be closed. If such rate is superseded on Telerate Page 3750
by a corrected rate before 12:00 noon (London time) on such LIBOR
Determination Date, the corrected rate as so substituted will be LIBOR
for such LIBOR Determination Date.

appear on Telerate Page 3750 as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets Commodities News or such other page as may replace such
Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation Agent shall determine the
arithmetic mean of the offered quotations of the Reference Banks (as
defined below) to leading banks in the London interbank market for
three-month U.S. Dollar deposits in Europe (in an amount determined by
the Calculation Agent) by reference to requests for quotations as of
approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (London time) on the LIBOR Determination Date
made by the Calculation Agent to the Reference Banks. If, on any LIBOR
Determination Date, at least two of the Reference Banks provide such
quotations, LIBOR shall equal the arithmetic mean of such quotations.
If, on any LIBOR Determination Date, only one or none of the Reference
Banks provide such a quotation, LIBOR shall be deemed to be the
arithmetic mean of the offered

determine a rate in accordance with at least one of the procedures
provided above, LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be LIBOR in

will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).

in writing, the Company and the Paying Agent of the applicable Interest Rate in
effect for the related Interest Period. The Calculation Agent shall, upon the
request of the holder of any Debt Securities, provide the Interest Rate
applicable to the related Interest Period. All calculations made by the
Calculation Agent in the absence of manifest error shall be conclusive for all
purposes and binding on the Company and the holders of the Debt Securities. The
Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on information received from the
Calculation Agent or the Company as to the Interest Rate. The Company shall,
from time to time, provide any necessary information to the Paying Agent
relating to any original issue discount and interest on the Debt Securities
that is included in any payment and reportable for taxable income calculation
purposes.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company
shall have the right, from time to time and without causing an Event of
Default, to defer payments of interest on the Debt Securities by extending the
interest payment period on the Debt Securities at any time and from time to
time during the term of the Debt Securities, for up to twenty consecutive
quarterly periods (each such extended interest payment period, together with
all previous and further consecutive extensions thereof, is referred to herein
as an &#147;Extension Period&#148;), during which Extension Period no interest shall be
due and payable (except any Additional Interest that may be due and payable).
No Extension Period may end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date or
extend beyond the Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or the Special Redemption
Date, as the case may be. During any Extension Period, interest will continue
to accrue on the Debt Securities, and interest on such accrued interest (such
accrued interest and interest thereon referred to herein as &#147;Deferred
Interest&#148;) will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Interest Rate in effect
for such Extension Period, compounded quarterly from the date such Deferred
Interest would have been payable were it not for the Extension Period, to the
extent permitted by law. No interest or Deferred Interest (except any
Additional Interest that may be due and payable) shall be due and payable
during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof. At the end of any such Extension Period
the Company shall pay all Deferred Interest then accrued and unpaid on the Debt
Securities; provided, however, that during any such Extension Period, the

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 3.01. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest; Agreed Treatment
of the Debt Securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Company covenants and agrees that it will duly and punctually pay
or cause to be paid all payments due on the Debt Securities at the place, at
the respective times and in the manner provided in this Indenture and the Debt
Securities. At the option of the Company, each installment of interest on the
Debt Securities may be paid (i)&nbsp;by mailing checks for such interest payable to
the order of the holders of Debt Securities entitled thereto as they appear on
the Debt Security Register or (ii)&nbsp;by wire transfer of immediately available funds to any account with a banking institution
located in the United States designated by such holders to the Paying Agent no
later than the related record date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Indenture or any Debt Security, if the Trust or the Trustee
of the Trust is the holder of any Debt Security, then all payments in respect
of such Debt Security shall be made by the Company in immediately available
funds when due.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Company will treat the Debt Securities as indebtedness, and the
interest payable in respect of such Debt Securities as interest, for all U.S.
federal income tax purposes. All payments in respect of such Debt Securities
will be made free and clear of U.S. withholding tax to any beneficial owner
thereof that has provided an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN (or any
substitute or successor form) establishing its non-U.S. status for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;As of the date of this Indenture, the Company represents that it has
no intention to exercise its right under Section&nbsp;2.11 to defer payments of
interest on the Debt Securities by commencing an Extension Period.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;As of the date of this Indenture, the Company represents that the
likelihood that it would exercise its right under Section&nbsp;2.11 to defer
payments of interest on the Debt Securities by commencing an Extension Period
at any time during which the Debt Securities are outstanding is remote because
of the restrictions that would be imposed on the Company&#146;s ability to declare
or pay dividends or distributions on, or to redeem, purchase or make a
liquidation payment with respect to, any of its outstanding equity and on the
Company&#146;s ability to make any payments of principal of or interest on, or
repurchase or redeem, any of its debt securities that rank <I>pari passu </I>in all
respects with (or junior in interest to) the Debt Securities.

be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as provided in this
Indenture and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the
Company in respect of the Debt Securities or of this Indenture may be served.
The Company hereby appoints the Trustee at ITS Unit Trust Window, 4 New York
Plaza, Ground Floor, New York, New York 10004, attention: ITS (Houston)
Affirmative Insurance Holdings Statutory Trust I as such office or agency. In
case the Company shall fail to maintain any such office or agency in New York,
New York or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in
the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be
served at the Principal Office of the Trustee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to any such office or agency, the Company may from time to
time designate one or more offices or agencies outside Houston, Texas where the
Debt Securities may be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange
in the manner provided in this Indenture, and the Company may from time to time rescind
such designation, as the Company may deem desirable or expedient; provided,
however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the
Company of its obligation to maintain any such office or agency in New York,
New York for the purposes above mentioned. The Company will give to the Trustee
prompt written notice of any such designation or rescission thereof.

net amounts received and retained by the Trust for distribution to holders of

herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers&#146; Certificate (unless

this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable
expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all Persons not regularly in
its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance that arises from
its negligence or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify each of
the Trustee (including in its individual capacity) and any predecessor Trustee
(and its officers, agents, directors and employees) for, and to hold it
harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claim, liability or expense
including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the Trustee), except

negligence or bad faith of such indemnitee, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of this Trust, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in the premises.
The obligations of the Company under this Section&nbsp;6.06 to compensate and
indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for documented
expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness
hereunder. Such additional indebtedness shall be secured by (and the Company
hereby grants and pledges to the Trustee) a lien prior to that of the Debt
Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as
such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular
Debt Securities.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7.01. Action by Securityholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a specified
percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities or aggregate
liquidation amount of Capital Securities may take any action (including the
making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or
the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such
action the holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be
evidenced (a)&nbsp;by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor
executed by such Securityholders or holders of Capital Securities, as the case
may be, in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b)&nbsp;by the
record of such holders of Debt Securities voting in favor thereof at any
meeting of such Securityholders duly called and held in accordance with the
provisions of Article&nbsp;VIII or of such holders of Capital Securities duly called
and held in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration, or (c)&nbsp;by a
combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a
meeting of such Securityholders or holders of Capital Securities, as the case
may be, or (d)&nbsp;by any other method the Trustee deems satisfactory.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officers&#146;
Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such Debt Securities for the
determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a
record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action or revocation of the same may be given before
or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close
of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the
purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of
outstanding Debt Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action or revocation of the same, and for that purpose the outstanding Debt
Securities shall be computed as of the record date; provided, however, that no
such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record
date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the
provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7.02. Proof of Execution by Securityholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of Sections&nbsp;6.01, 6.02 and 8.05, proof of the
execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or such Securityholder&#146;s agent
or proxy shall be sufficient if made in accordance with such reasonable rules
and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall
be satisfactory to the Trustee. The ownership of Debt Securities shall be
proved by the

registrar. The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred
to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record of any Securityholders&#146; meeting shall be proved in the manner
provided in Section&nbsp;8.06.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7.03. Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Debt
Security, the Company, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent,
any transfer agent and any Debt Security registrar may deem the Person in whose
name such Debt Security shall be registered upon the Debt Security Register to
be, and may treat such Person as, the absolute owner of such Debt Security
(whether or not such Debt Security shall be overdue) for the purpose of
receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on such Debt Security and for all other purposes; and neither the
Company nor the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent nor any Paying Agent nor
any transfer agent nor any Debt Security registrar shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any holder for the time
being or upon such holder&#146;s order shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum
or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys
payable upon any such Debt Security.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7.04. Debt Securities Owned by Company Deemed Not Outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal
amount of Debt Securities have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver
under this Indenture, Debt Securities which are owned by the Company or any
other obligor on the Debt Securities or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with
the Company (other than the Trust) or any other obligor on the Debt Securities
shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any
such determination; provided, that for the purposes of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver,
only Debt Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows
are so owned shall be so disregarded. Debt Securities so owned which have been
pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this
Section&nbsp;7.04 if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee
the pledgee&#146;s right to vote such Debt Securities and that the pledgee is not
the Company or any such other obligor or Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with
the Company or any such other obligor. In the case of a dispute as to such
right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be
full protection to the Trustee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7.05. Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as
provided in Section&nbsp;7.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the
percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities specified in
this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder (in cases where no
record date has been set pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.01) or any holder as of an
applicable record date (in cases where a record date has been set pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7.01) of a Debt Security (or any Debt Security issued in whole or in
part in exchange or substitution therefor) the serial number of which is shown
by the evidence to be included in the Debt Securities the holders of which have
consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at the
Principal Office of the Trustee and upon proof of holding as provided in Section&nbsp;7.02, revoke such
action so far as concerns such Debt Security (or so far as concerns the
principal amount represented by any exchanged or substituted Debt Security).
Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Debt Security
shall be conclusive and binding upon

which shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but

in the Debt Securities shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Indenture or of such Debt

as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein or therein.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to Article&nbsp;XI, the Company will have the right at all times to
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Indenture and the Debt
Securities to a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,
provided, that, in the event of any such assignment, the Company will remain
liable for all such obligations. Subject to the foregoing, this Indenture is
binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. This Indenture may not otherwise be assigned
by the parties thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 14.12. Acknowledgment of Rights.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company acknowledges that, with respect to any Debt Securities held by
the Trust or the Institutional Trustee of the Trust, if the Institutional
Trustee of the Trust fails to enforce its rights under this Indenture as the
holder of Debt Securities held as the assets of the Trust after the holders of
a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of the Trust have so
directed in writing such Institutional Trustee, a holder of record of such
Capital Securities may to the fullest extent permitted by law institute legal
proceedings directly against the Company to enforce such Institutional
Trustee&#146;s rights under this Indenture without first instituting any legal
proceedings against such Institutional Trustee or any other Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Company to pay
interest (or premium, if any) or principal on the Debt Securities on the date
such interest (or premium, if any) or principal is otherwise due and payable
(or in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or the Special Redemption
date, as applicable), the Company acknowledges that a holder of record of
Capital Securities of the Trust may directly institute a proceeding against the
Company for enforcement of payment to such holder directly of the principal of
(or premium, if any) or interest on the Debt Securities having an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital
Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date (or, in the case
of redemption, on the Redemption Date or the Special Redemption Date, as
applicable) specified in the Debt Securities.

extended interest payment period, together with all previous and further
consecutive extensions thereof, is referred to herein as an &#147;Extension
Period&#148;), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable

Extension Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debt Securities, and
interest on such accrued interest (such accrued interest and interest thereon
referred to herein as &#147;Deferred Interest&#148;) will accrue at an annual rate equal

Redemption Date and provided, further, however, during any such Extension
Period, the Company may not (i)&nbsp;declare or pay any dividends or distributions

Company may further extend such Extension Period, provided, that such period
together with all such previous and further consecutive extensions thereof
shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods. Upon the termination of any
Extension Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest, the Company may

in whole but not in part, at any time, within 90&nbsp;days following the occurrence
of such Tax Event or an Investment Company Event (the &#147;Special Redemption
Date&#148;), as the case may be, at the Special Redemption Price. In the event that
the Special Redemption Date falls on a day prior to the LIBOR Determination
Date for any Interest Period, then the Company shall be required to pay to
Securityholders, on the Business Day following such LIBOR Determination Date,
any additional amount of interest that would have been payable on the Special
Redemption Date had the amount of interest determined on such LIBOR
Determination Date been known on the first day of such Interest Period.

Securities are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Debt Securities will
be redeemed <I>pro rata </I>or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Redemption Price&#148; means 100% of the principal amount of the Debt
Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Debt
Securities to the Redemption Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Special Redemption Price&#148; means (1)&nbsp;if the Special Redemption Date is
before March&nbsp;15, 2010, 2010, 107.5% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of such redemption and (2)
if the Special Redemption Date is on or after March&nbsp;15, 2010, 2010, the
Redemption Price for such Special Redemption Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of redemption of this Debt Security in part only, a new Debt
Security or Debt Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in
the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have
occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Debt Securities may be
declared, and, in certain cases, shall <I>ipso facto </I>become, due and payable, and
upon any such declaration of acceleration shall become due and payable, in each
case, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in
the Indenture.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee,
