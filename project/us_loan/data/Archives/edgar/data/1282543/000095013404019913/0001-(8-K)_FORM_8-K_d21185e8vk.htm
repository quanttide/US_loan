<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;21, 2004, Affirmative Insurance Holdings Statutory Trust I, a
Delaware statutory trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;), the newly formed, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;), issued
$30,000,000 of trust preferred securities (the &#147;Capital Securities&#148;) in a
private placement pursuant to an applicable exemption from registration. The
Capital Securities mature on March&nbsp;15, 2035, but may be redeemed at the
Company&#146;s option beginning on March&nbsp;15, 2010. The Capital Securities require
quarterly distributions by the Trust to the holder of the Capital Securities,
initially at a fixed rate of 7.545% per annum for five years, and thereafter at
a variable rate which will reset quarterly at the three-month LIBOR rate plus
3.60%. Distributions are cumulative and will accrue from the date of original
issuance but may be deferred by the Company for up to 20 consecutive quarterly
periods. The Company has irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the Capital
Securities pursuant to a guarantee agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to
this Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item
2.03.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The proceeds of the Capital Securities received by the Trust, along with
proceeds of $928,000 received by the Trust from the issuance of common
securities (the &#147;Common Securities&#148;) by the Trust to the Company, will be used
to purchase $30,928,000 of the Company&#146;s junior subordinated debt securities
(the &#147;Debt Securities&#148;), issued pursuant to an indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;)
entered into between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the
&#147;Trustee&#148;). The proceeds of the Debt Securities will be used to increase the
Company&#146;s policyholders surplus to approximately $135,000,000.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Debt Securities mature on March&nbsp;15, 2035, but the Company may redeem the
Debt Securities, in whole or in part, beginning on March&nbsp;15, 2010 in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture. The Debt Securities bear interest at a
fixed rate of 7.545% per annum for five years, and thereafter at a variable
rate which will reset quarterly at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 3.60%.
Interest is cumulative and will accrue from the date of original issuance but
may be deferred by the Company for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Early Redemption. </B>The Capital Securities and Debt Securities may be redeemed at
the option of the Company beginning on March&nbsp;15, 2010, and may be redeemed
earlier following the occurrence of a Special Event. &#147;Special Event&#148; is defined
in the transaction documents as either:
