Item 8.01. Other Events.


On December 28, 2004, the Company filed its operating reports for the period
from June 24, 2004 to November 30, 2004 with the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Ohio. Such filing was made pursuant to the filing
requirements of the Office of the United States Trustee. The filing includes
(among other information) a consolidated and consolidating balance sheet as of
November 30, 2004 and operating statements for the month ended November 30, 2004
and for the period from June 24, 2004 through November 30, 2004. The
consolidated balance sheet information and consolidated operating statement
information included in the Bankruptcy Court filing are included with this
report as Exhibit 99.1 (the "Bankruptcy Court Statements").

The Bankruptcy Court Statements are unaudited and do not conform to generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). All goodwill and other intangible
assets have been eliminated in the preparation of the Bankruptcy Court
Statements. Reference is made to the footnotes to the financial statements for a
statement of other limitations and qualifications applicable to the statements.

As previously reported, the Company's 2002 and 2003 year-end financial
statements have not been audited or certified. Also, as previously reported, in
view of the Company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and in view of the
resignation of the independent accounting firm previously engaged to audit the
Company's financial statements, it is doubtful that such statements will ever be
certified. The Company's aforementioned year-end reports remain incomplete, and
the Company remains unable to generate GAAP compliant statements for subsequent
interim periods for inclusion in filings on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. In view of the
foregoing, the Company is unable to, and does not expect in the future to be
able to, submit a reconciliation of the differences between the Bankruptcy Court
Statements and comparable statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

See FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS appearing below in this Report.

Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(a)      Financial Statements of Business Acquired.

         Not applicable.

(b)      Pro Forma Financial Information.

         Not applicable.

(c)      Exhibits.

         See Exhibit Index.


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.


This Report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, including, without

<PAGE>

limitation, statements containing the words "doubtful" and "not expect" and
words of similar import. Because forward-looking statements are based on a
number of beliefs, estimates and assumptions that could ultimately prove
inaccurate, there is no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to
be accurate.

                                   SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)      On June 24, 2004 (the "Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing Date"), Sight
         Resource Corporation (the "Company") and its subsidiaries each filed
         voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
         No trustee has been appointed, and the Company and its subsidiaries
         continue to manage their business as debtors in possession.

(2)      The accompanying statements are unaudited, have been prepared to comply
         with filing requirements of the Office of the United States Trustee,
         and do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The
         last audit of the Company's financial statements was completed as of
         and for the period ended December 29, 2001.

(3)      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis
         reflecting the write off, as of a date prior to the Chapter 11
         Bankruptcy Filing Date, of all goodwill and other intangible assets.
         Except for the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets, the
         financial statements have been prepared on a "going concern" basis and
         do not reflect any reductions in the carrying value of assets or other
         adjustments that may be appropriate for financial statements prepared
         on a liquidation basis.

(4)      The liabilities reflected in the accompanying financial statements do
         not include claims of lessors in respect of store leases rejected by
         the Company during the bankruptcy process. Such claims will be
         substantial. There may also be other claims filed by creditors against
         the Company in the Chapter 11 proceedings that are not reflected as
         liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.

(5)      The Accumulated Deficit Pre-Petition has been calculated on the basis
         of unaudited operating results since December 29, 2001 (that being the
         date of the last audit of the Company's financial statements) and
         reflecting the write off, as of the date prior to the Chapter 11
         Bankruptcy Filing Date, of all goodwill and other intangible assets.

(6)      Non-Operating Expenses are net of interest income and include
         professional fees, U.S. Trustee fees, and personnel retention bonuses.
