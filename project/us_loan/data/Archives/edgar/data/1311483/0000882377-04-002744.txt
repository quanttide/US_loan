                                  Organization
                                  ------------

         Section 2.01. Name. The trust created hereby (the "Trust") shall be
known as "Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2", in which name the Owner Trustee
may conduct the business of the Trust, make and execute contracts and other

engage in the following activities and the Trust shall have the power and
authority:

                  (i) to issue the Notes pursuant to the Indenture and the
         Certificates pursuant to this Trust Agreement and to sell the Notes and
         the Certificates;

                  (ii) to pay the organizational, start-up and transactional
         expenses of the Trust;

                  (iii) to assign, grant, transfer, pledge and convey the
         Mortgage Loans pursuant to the Indenture and to hold, manage and
         distribute to the Certificateholder pursuant to Section 5.01 herein,
         any portion of the Mortgage Loans released from the Lien of, and
         remitted to the Trust pursuant to the Indenture;

                  (iv) to enter into and perform its obligations under the Basic
         Documents to which it is to be a party;

                  (v) if directed by holders of Certificates representing more
         than 50% of the beneficial interests in the Trust, sell the Trust
         Estate subsequent to the discharge of the Indenture, all for the
         benefit of the holders of the Certificates;

                  (vi) to engage in those activities, including entering into
         agreements, that are necessary, suitable or convenient to accomplish
         the foregoing or are incidental thereto or connected therewith; and

                  (vii) subject to compliance with the Basic Documents, to
         engage in such other activities as may be required in connection with
         conservation of the Owner Trust Estate and the making of distributions
         to the Certificateholder and the Noteholders.

         The Trust is hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing activities.
The Trust shall not engage in any activity other than in connection with the
foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the terms of this Trust
Agreement or the Basic Documents.

         Section 2.04. Appointment of Owner Trustee. The Depositor hereby
appoints the Owner Trustee as trustee of the Trust effective as of the date
hereof, to have all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

<PAGE>

         Section 2.05. Initial Capital Contribution of Owner Trust Estate. The
Depositor hereby sells, assigns, transfers, conveys and sets over to the Trust,
as of the date hereof, the sum of $1. The Owner Trustee hereby acknowledges
receipt in trust from the Depositor, as of the date hereof, of the foregoing
contribution, which shall constitute the initial corpus of the Trust and shall
be deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account. The Owner Trustee also
acknowledges on behalf of the Trust the receipt in trust of the Mortgage Loans
and the Note Insurance Policy pursuant to Section 3.01, the rights with respect
to the Cap Contracts and the rights with respect to the representations and
warranties made by the Seller and the Responsible Party under the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement which shall constitute the Owner Trust Estate.

         Section 2.06. Declaration of Trust. The Owner Trustee hereby declares
that it shall hold the Owner Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the
conditions set forth herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders,
subject to the obligations of the Trust under the Basic Documents. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that the Trust constitute a "statutory trust"
under the Statutory Trust Statute and that this Trust Agreement constitute the
governing instrument of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that, for federal and state income and state and local franchise tax
purposes, the Trust (A) shall not be treated as (i) an association subject
separately to taxation as a corporation or (ii) a "publicly traded partnership"
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1, (B) shall, as of the Closing
Date, be disregarded as a separate entity (and if at any other time the Trust
Certificates are held by more than one person for federal income tax purposes,
shall be treated as a partnership), and (C) that each Class of Notes shall be
debt, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted to further this
intention. It is the intention of the parties hereto that, for federal, state
and local tax purposes, the Depositor shall at no time be treated as an owner of
the Mortgage Loans or as the issuer of or obligor on indebtedness secured by the
Mortgage Loans and evidenced by the Notes, and the parties hereto mutually
covenant to take all pertinent tax reporting positions consistent with that
intent. Except as otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement, the rights of the
Certificateholder will be those of equity owners of the Trust. Effective as of
the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all rights, powers and duties set
forth herein and in the Statutory Trust Statute with respect to accomplishing
the purposes of the Trust.

         Section 2.07. Liability of the Holders of the Certificates. The Holders
of the Certificates shall be jointly and severally liable directly to and shall
indemnify any injured party for all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses of the Trust and the Owner Trustee (including Expenses, to the extent
not paid out of the Owner Trust Estate); provided, however, that the Holders of
the Certificates shall not be liable for payments required to be made on the
Notes or the Certificates, or for any losses incurred by a Certificateholder in
the capacity of an investor in the Certificates or a Noteholder in the capacity
of an investor in the Notes. The Holders of the Certificates shall be liable for
and shall promptly pay any entity level taxes imposed on the Trust. In addition,
any third party creditors of the Trust (other than in connection with the
obligations described in the second preceding sentence for which the Holders of
the Certificates shall not be liable) shall be deemed third party beneficiaries
of this paragraph. The obligations of the Holders of the Certificates under this
paragraph shall be evidenced by the Certificates.

         Section 2.08. Title to Trust Property. Except with respect to the
Mortgage Loans, which will be assigned of record to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to the Indenture, legal title to

<PAGE>

the Owner Trust Estate shall be vested at all times in the Trust as a separate
legal entity except where applicable law in any jurisdiction requires title to
any part of the Owner Trust Estate to be vested in a trustee or trustees, in
which case title shall be deemed to be vested in the Owner Trustee, a co-trustee
and/or a separate trustee, as the case may be.

         Section 2.09. Situs of Trust. The Trust will be located and
administered in the State of Delaware. All bank accounts maintained by the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall be located in the State of Delaware. The
Trust shall not have any employees in any state other than Delaware; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall restrict or prohibit the Owner Trustee from
having employees within or without the State of Delaware or taking actions
outside the State of Delaware in order to comply with Section 2.03. Payments
will be received by the Trust only in Delaware, New York or California, and
payments will be made by the Trust only from Delaware, New York or California.
The only office of the Trust will be at the Corporate Trust Office in Delaware.

         Section 2.10. Representations and Warranties of the Depositor. The
Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

                  (i) The Depositor is duly organized and validly existing as a
         corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
         with power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its
         business as such properties are currently owned and such business is
         presently conducted.

                  (ii) The Depositor is duly qualified to do business as a
         foreign corporation in good standing and has obtained all necessary
         licenses and approvals in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or
         lease of its property or the conduct of its business shall require such
         qualifications and in which the failure to so qualify would have a
         material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets or
         condition (financial or other) of the Depositor.

                  (iii) The Depositor has the power and authority to execute and
         deliver this Trust Agreement and to carry out its terms; the Depositor
         has full power and authority to convey and assign the property to be
         conveyed and assigned to and deposited with the Trust as part of the
         Owner Trust Estate and the Depositor has duly authorized such
         conveyance and assignment and deposit to the Trust by all necessary
         corporate action; and the execution, delivery and performance of this
         Trust Agreement have been duly authorized by the Depositor by all
         necessary corporate action.

                  (iv) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Trust Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof do not conflict
         with, result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or
         constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time) a default under,
         the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Depositor, or any
         indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Depositor is a
         party or by which it is bound; nor result in the creation or imposition
         of any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any
         such indenture, agreement or other instrument (other than pursuant to
         the Basic Documents); nor violate any law or, to the best of the
         Depositor's knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the
         Depositor of any court or of any federal or state regulatory body,
         administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having
         jurisdiction over the Depositor or its properties.


<PAGE>

                  (v) The Trust is not required to register as an investment
         company under the Investment Company Act and is not under the control
         of a Person required to so register.

         Section 2.11. Reserved.

         Section 2.12. Investment Company. Neither the Depositor nor any holder
of a Certificate shall take any action which would cause the Trust to become an
"investment company" which would be required to register under the Investment
Company Act.

         Section 2.13. Transfer of Trust Estate to Owner Trustee. (a) Effective
as of the date hereof, the Depositor does hereby assign, transfer, and otherwise
convey to, and deposit with, the Trust, until this Agreement terminates pursuant
to Section 8.01, the entire Trust Estate, such conveyance to be made in exchange
for the Notes and the Certificates. Such assignment includes, without
limitation, all amounts payable to and all rights of the holder of the
Collateral pursuant to this Agreement.

         The conveyance of the Collateral and all other assets constituting the
Trust Estate by the Depositor as contemplated hereby is absolute and is intended
by the parties to constitute a sale of the Collateral and all other assets
constituting the Trust Estate by the Depositor to the Trust. It is, further, not
intended that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of security for a loan. If such
conveyance is deemed to be a pledge of security for a loan, however, the
Depositor intends that the rights and obligations of the parties to such loan
shall be established pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Depositor also
intends and agrees that, in such event:

                  (i) this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under
         applicable law and shall be deemed to create valid and continuing
         security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Trust
         Estate (including, without limitation, the Collateral, the Certificate
         Distribution Account and any proceeds thereof) in favor of the Trust,
         which security interest is prior to all other Liens, and is enforceable
         as such as against creditors of and purchasers from the Depositor;

                  (ii) other than the security interest granted to the Trust
         pursuant to this Agreement, Depositor has not pledged, assigned, sold,
         granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Trust
         Estate, has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any
         financing statements against the Trust Estate that includes a
         description of collateral covering the Trust Estate other than any
         financing statements relating to the security interest granted to the
         Trust hereunder or that has been terminated. The Depositor is not aware
         of any judgment or tax lien filings against Depositor;

                  (iii) the Depositor owns and has good and marketable title to
         the Trust Estate free and clear of any Lien, claim or encumbrance of
         any Person;

                  (iv) the Certificate Distribution Account constitutes a
         "deposit account" within the meaning of the applicable UCC. The
         Depositor has directed the bank where the Certificate Distribution
         Account is held to take all steps necessary to cause the Certificate
         Paying Agent to become the account holder of the Certificate
         Distribution Account. The Certificate Distribution Account is not in
         the name of any Person other than as provided in Section 3.10 of this
         Agreement. The Depositor has not consented to the maintenance of

<PAGE>

         the Certificate Distribution Account in compliance with instructions of
         any Person other than the Certificate Paying Agent;

                  (v) the Trust Estate (excluding the Certificate Distribution
         Account and any proceeds thereof) constitutes "deposit accounts,"
         "general intangibles" and "instruments" within the meaning of the
         applicable UCC). The Depositor has received all required consents and
         approvals to the pledge of the portions of the Trust Estate (excluding
         the Certificate Distribution Account and any proceeds thereof)
         constituting payment intangibles;

                  (vi) the Depositor has caused or will have caused, within ten
         days, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the
         appropriate filing offices under applicable law in order to perfect the
         security interest in the Trust Estate granted to the Trust hereunder.
         All financing statements filed or to be filed against the Depositor in
         favor of the Trust (or any subsequent assignee, including, without
         limitation, the Indenture Trustee) in connection herewith describing
         the Trust Estate contain a statement to the following effect, "A
         purchase of, or security interest in, any collateral described in this
         financing statement will violate the rights of the secured party;" and

                  (vii) the Depositor shall, to the extent consistent with this
         Agreement, take such additional reasonable actions as may be necessary
         to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security
         interest in the Collateral and the other assets of the Trust Estate,
         such security interest would be a perfected security interest of first
         priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout
         the life of this Agreement. Notifications to, and acknowledgments,
         receipts or confirmations from, Persons holding such property, shall be
         deemed to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
         confirmations from, financial intermediaries, bailees or agents (as
         applicable) of the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust (or any
         subsequent assignee, including, without limitation, the Indenture
         Trustee) for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
         applicable law.

         (b) The Owner Trustee declares that it holds and will hold the Trust
Estate and such documents and instruments and that it holds and will hold all
other assets and documents to be included in the Trust Estate, in trust for the
exclusive use and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders.

         (c) Except as expressly provided in Section 8.01, neither the Depositor
nor any Certificateholder shall be able to revoke the Trust established
hereunder. Except as provided in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 5.01 and 8.01
hereof, the Owner Trustee or Certificate Paying Agent (as applicable) shall not
assign, sell, dispose of or transfer any interest in, nor may the Depositor or
any Certificateholder withdraw from the Trust, the Collateral or other asset
constituting the Trust Estate.

                                  ARTICLE III

                 Conveyance of the Mortgage Loans; Certificates
                 ----------------------------------------------

         Section 3.01. Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

         (a) The Depositor, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, does hereby contribute, transfer, convey and assign to the Trust on
behalf of the Holders of the Notes and Certificates and the Note Insurer,
without recourse (i) all of its right, title and interest in and to each Initial
Mortgage Loan, including the related Cut-Off Date Principal Balance, all
interest accruing thereon after the related Due Date in November and all
collections in respect of principal received after the related Cut-Off Date
(other than payments in respect of accrued interest on the Initial Mortgage
Loans through the related Due Date in November); (ii) property which secured
such Initial Mortgage Loan and which has been acquired by foreclosure or deed in
lieu of foreclosure; (iii) its interest in any insurance policies in respect of
the Initial Mortgage Loans; (iv) such amounts as may be deposited into and held
by the Trustee in the Pre-Funding Account and the Capitalized Interest Account;
(v) all proceeds of any of the foregoing; (vi) the Depositor's rights under the
Purchase Agreement (other than any rights of the Depositor to indemnification
under Section 6.1(a), (c), (d) and (e)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement), together
with all rights of the Depositor to require the Seller to cure any breach
thereof or to repurchase or substitute for any affected Mortgage Loan in
accordance with the Purchase Agreement; and (vii) certain payments under the
Corridor Contract. In addition, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Depositor
shall cause the Note Insurer to deliver the Certificate Insurance Policy to the
Trustee.

         The conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by the Depositor (on behalf of the
Seller) to the Trust hereunder is intended to facilitate the simultaneous
issuance of the Notes under the Indenture and issuance of the Certificates
hereunder to the Seller as Holder, and the Depositor (on behalf of the Seller)
has no present intention of selling any of the Certificates. Accordingly, at the
time of the transaction set forth herein, the Seller will retain without
interruption, through the ownership of the Certificates, the economic benefits
associated with ownership of the Mortgage Loans as well as the economic burdens
associated with such ownership, subject to the lien of the Indenture and subject
to this Agreement.

         Section 3.02. Initial Ownership. Upon the formation of the Trust by the
contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.05 and until the conveyance
of the Mortgage Loans pursuant to Section 3.01 and the issuance of the
Certificates, and thereafter except as otherwise permitted hereunder, the
Depositor shall be the sole beneficial owner.

         Section 3.03. The Certificates. The Certificates shall be issued in the
form of one or more Certificates, each representing not less than a 10%
Certificate Percentage Interest. At initial issuance, the Certificates shall be
issued to and registered in the name of Home Loan and Investment Bank, F.S.B.
The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile
signature of an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee and authenticated in the
manner provided in Section 3.04. Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile
signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have
been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be validly issued
and entitled to the benefit of this Trust Agreement, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the
authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did not hold such


<PAGE>

offices at the date of authentication and delivery of such Certificates. A
Person shall become a Certificateholder and shall be entitled to the rights and
subject to the obligations of a Certificateholder hereunder upon such Person's
acceptance of a Certificate duly registered in such Person's name, pursuant to
Section 3.05.

         A transferee of a Certificate shall become a Certificateholder and
shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a
Certificateholder hereunder upon such transferee's acceptance of a Certificate
duly registered in such transferee's name pursuant to and upon satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 3.05.

         Section 3.04. Authentication of Certificates. The Owner Trustee shall
cause all Certificates issued hereunder to be executed and authenticated on
behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered to or upon the written order of
the Depositor, signed by its chairman of the board, its president or any vice
president, without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized
denominations. No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit under this
Trust Agreement or be valid for any purpose unless there shall appear on such
Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth
in Exhibit A, executed by the Owner Trustee by manual signature; such
authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall
have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Certificates shall be
dated the date of their authentication.

         Section 3.05. Registration of and Limitations on Transfer and Exchange
of Certificates. The Certificate Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept, a
Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, the Certificate Registrar shall provide for the registration of
Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company shall be the initial Certificate Registrar.
If the Certificate Registrar resigns or is removed, the Majority
Certificateholder, with the consent of the Owner Trustee, shall appoint a
successor Certificate Registrar.

         Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth below with respect
to the Certificate, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any
Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.09, the
Owner Trustee shall execute, authenticate and deliver in the name of the
designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates in authorized
denominations of a like aggregate amount dated the date of authentication by the
Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar. At the option of a Holder,
Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denominations
of a like aggregate amount upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at
the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.09.

         Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder or such
Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Certificate surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently
disposed of by the Certificate Registrar in accordance with its customary
practice.

         No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Certificates, but the Owner Trustee may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.


<PAGE>

         No Person shall become a Certificateholder until it shall establish its
non-foreign status by submitting to the Certificate Paying Agent an IRS Form W-9
and the Certificate of Non-Foreign Status set forth in Exhibit D hereto.

         No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of a Certificate shall
be made unless such transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws or is made in accordance with said Act and laws. In the event of
any such transfer, the Certificate Registrar or the Depositor shall prior to
such transfer require the transferee to execute (A) either (i) (a) an investment
letter in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (or in such form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the
Depositor) which investment letter shall not be an expense of the Trust, the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer or the Depositor and
which investment letter states that, among other things, such transferee (1) is
a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined under Rule 144A, acting for its own
account or the accounts of other "qualified institutional buyers" as defined
under Rule 144A, and (2) is aware that the proposed transferor intends to rely
on the exemption from registration requirements under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, provided by Rule 144A or (ii) (a) a written Opinion of Counsel
acceptable to and in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate
Registrar, the Owner Trustee and the Depositor that such transfer may be made
pursuant to an exemption, describing the applicable exemption and the basis
therefor, from said Act and laws or is being made pursuant to said Act and laws,
which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer or the Depositor and (b) the
transferee executes a representation letter, substantially in the form of
Exhibit F to the Agreement, and transferor executes a representation letter,
substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, each acceptable to and in form
and substance satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee and
the Depositor certifying the facts surrounding such transfer, which
representation letters shall not be an expense of the Trust, the Owner Trustee,
the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer or the Depositor and (B) the Certificate
of Non-Foreign Status (in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D)
acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee and the Depositor, which certificate
shall not be an expense of the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar or the Depositor. The Holder of a Certificate desiring to effect such
transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer and the Depositor against any
liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in
accordance with such federal and state laws.

         No transfer of Certificates or any interest therein shall be made to
any Person unless the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
and the Servicer are provided with an Opinion of Counsel which establishes to
the satisfaction of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
and the Servicer that the purchase of Certificates is permissible under
applicable law, will not constitute or result in any prohibited transaction
under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and will not subject the Depositor, the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the Servicer to any obligation or
liability (including obligations or liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement, which Opinion of
Counsel shall not be an expense of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar or the Servicer. In lieu of such Opinion of Counsel, a
Person acquiring such Certificates may provide a certification in the form of
Exhibit G to this Agreement, which the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar and the Servicer may rely upon without further inquiry

<PAGE>

or investigation. Neither an Opinion of Counsel nor a certification will be
required in connection with the initial transfer of any such Certificate by the
Depositor to an affiliate of the Depositor (in which case, the Depositor or any
affiliate thereof shall be deemed to have represented that such affiliate is not
a Plan or a Person investing Plan Assets of any Plan) and the Owner Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon a
representation (which, upon the request of the Owner Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar, shall be a written representation) from the Depositor of the status
of such transferee as an affiliate of the Depositor.

         No offer, sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition
(including any pledge, sale or transfer under a repurchase transaction or
securities loan) of any Certificate shall be made to any transferee unless,
prior to such disposition, the proposed transferor delivers to the Owner Trustee
and the Certificate Registrar and the Note Insurer an Opinion of Counsel,
rendered by a law firm generally recognized to be qualified to opine concerning
the tax aspects of asset securitization satisfactory to the Note Insurer, to the
effect that such transfer (including any disposition permitted following any
default under any pledge or repurchase transaction) will not cause the Trust to
be (i) treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax
and relevant state income and franchise tax purposes or (ii) taxable as a
"publicly traded partnership" as defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.7704-1
for federal income tax purposes and relevant state franchise or income tax
purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph shall
not apply to the initial transfer of the Certificates to the Depositor.

         Section 3.06. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates. If (a)
any mutilated Certificate shall be surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or
if the Certificate Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered
to the Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee such security or indemnity as
may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of
notice to the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee that such Certificate
has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall execute on
behalf of the Trust and the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar, shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and
denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this
Section 3.06, the Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any expenses of the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar (including
fees and expenses of counsel) and any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to
this Section 3.06 shall constitute conclusive evidence of ownership in the
Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate shall be found at any time.

         Section 3.07. Persons Deemed Certificateholders. Prior to due
presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee,
the Certificate Registrar or any Certificate Paying Agent may treat the Person
in whose name any Certificate is registered in the Certificate Register as the
owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to
Section 5.02 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Trust, the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any Certificate Paying Agent shall
be bound by any notice to the contrary.

<PAGE>

         Section 3.08. Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and
Addresses. The Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
the Depositor, the Certificate Paying Agent or the Owner Trustee, within 15 days
after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a written request therefor from
the Depositor, the Certificate Paying Agent or the Owner Trustee, a list, in
such form as the Depositor, the Certificate Paying Agent or the Owner Trustee,
as the case may be, may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the
Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. Each Holder, by receiving
and holding a Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the
Trust, the Depositor, the Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar or
the Owner Trustee accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and
address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.

         Section 3.09. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Owner Trustee on
behalf of the Trust, shall maintain an office or offices or agency or agencies
where Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange
and where notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Certificates may be served. The Owner Trustee initially designates the office of
the agent of the Indenture Trustee at c/o DTC Transfer Services, 55 Water
Street, Jeanette Park Entrance, New York, New York 10041 for purposes of such
surrender and the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee as its office
for service of notices or demands. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt written
notice to the Depositor, the Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar
and the Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate
Register or any such office or agency.

         Section 3.10. Certificate Paying Agent. (a) The Certificate Paying
Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account on behalf of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of
the Certificates and Section 5.01 hereof from payments remitted to the
Certificate Paying Agent by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 3.05 of
the Indenture. The Trust hereby appoints Deutsche Bank National Trust Company as
Certificate Paying Agent and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company hereby accepts
such appointment and further agrees that it will be bound by the provisions of
this Trust Agreement relating to the Certificate Paying Agent and shall:

                  (i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due
         with respect to the Certificates in trust for the benefit of the
         Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons
         or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

                  (ii) give the Owner Trustee notice of any default by the Trust
         of which a Responsible Officer of the Certificate Paying Agent has
         actual knowledge in the making of any payment required to be made with
         respect to the Certificates;

                  (iii) at any time during the continuance of any such default,
         upon the written request of the Owner Trustee forthwith pay to the
         Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust all sums so held in Trust by such
         Certificate Paying Agent;

                  (iv) not resign from its position as Certificate Paying Agent
         so long as it is Indenture Trustee except that it shall immediately
         resign as Certificate Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the Owner
         Trustee on behalf of the Trust all sums held by it in trust for the
         payment of Certificates if at any time it ceases to meet the standards
         under this


<PAGE>

         Section 3.10 required to be met by the Certificate Paying Agent at the
         time of its appointment;

                  (v) comply with all requirements of the Code with respect to
         the withholding from any payments made by it on any Certificates of any
         applicable withholding taxes imposed thereon and with respect to any
         applicable reporting requirements in connection therewith; and

                  (vi) not institute bankruptcy proceedings against the Issuer
         in connection with this Trust Agreement.

         (b) The Trust may revoke such power and remove the Certificate Paying
Agent if it determines in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Trust Agreement in any
material respect. In the event that Deutsche Bank National Trust Company shall
no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent under this Trust Agreement and Paying
Agent under the Indenture, the Majority Certificateholder, with the consent of
the Owner Trustee, shall appoint a successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent
(which shall be a bank or trust company) and which shall also be the successor
Paying Agent under the Indenture. The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent hereunder to
execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument to the effect set forth
in Section 3.10(a) as it relates to the Certificate Paying Agent. The
Certificate Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Trust and upon
removal of a Certificate Paying Agent such Certificate Paying Agent shall also
return all funds in its possession to the Trust. The provisions of Sections
6.01, 6.04, 6.05, 6.06, 6.07, 6.08 and 7.01 shall apply to the Certificate
Paying Agent to the extent applicable. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context
requires otherwise.

         (c) The Certificate Paying Agent shall establish and maintain with
itself a segregated non-interest bearing trust account (the "Certificate
Distribution Account") in which the Certificate Paying Agent shall deposit, on
the same day as it is received from the Indenture Trustee, each remittance
received by the Certificate Paying Agent with respect to payments made pursuant
to the Indenture. The Certificate Paying Agent shall make all distributions to
Certificates, from moneys on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account, in
accordance with Section 5.01 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                      Authority and Duties of Owner Trustee
                      -------------------------------------

         Section 4.01. General Authority. The Owner Trustee is authorized and
directed to execute and deliver the Basic Documents to which the Trust is to be
a party and each certificate or other document attached as an exhibit to or
contemplated by the Basic Documents to which the Trust is to be a party and any
amendment or other agreement or instrument described herein all as approved by
the Depositor, as evidenced conclusively by the Owner Trustee's execution
thereof. In addition to the foregoing, the Owner Trustee is authorized, but
shall not be obligated, except as otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement, to
take all actions required of the Trust pursuant to the Basic Documents.

         Section 4.02. General Duties. It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee
to discharge (or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities pursuant to
the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Basic Documents to which the Trust is
a party and to administer the Trust in the interest of the Certificateholders,
subject to the Basic Documents and in accordance with the provisions of this
Trust Agreement.

         Section 4.03. Action upon Instruction. (a) Subject to Article IV and in
accordance with the terms of the Basic Documents, the Certificateholders may by
written instruction direct the Owner Trustee in the management of the Trust.
Such direction may be exercised at any time by written instruction of the
Certificateholders pursuant to Article IV.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall not be
required to take any action hereunder or under any Basic Document if the Owner
Trustee shall have reasonably determined, or shall have been advised by counsel,
that such action is likely to result in liability on the part of the Owner
Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any Basic Document or is
otherwise contrary to law.

         (c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is required to decide between
alternative courses of action permitted or required by the terms of this Trust
Agreement or under any Basic Document, or in the event that the Owner Trustee is
unsure as to the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement or any
Basic Document or any such provision is ambiguous as to its application, or is,
or appears to be, in conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the
event that this Trust Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee
or is silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner Trustee
is required to take with respect to a particular set of facts, the Owner Trustee
shall promptly give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the
circumstances) to the Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course
of action to be adopted, and to the extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith
in accordance with any written instruction of the Certificateholders, the Owner
Trustee shall not be liable on account of such action to any Person. If the
Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within 10 days of
such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be
specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may,
but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action not
inconsistent with this Trust Agreement or the Basic Documents, as it shall deem
to be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, and the Owner Trustee
shall have no liability to any Person for such action or inaction.


<PAGE>

         Section 4.04. No Duties Except as Specified under Specified Documents
or in Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to
manage, make any payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or
otherwise deal with the Owner Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from
taking any action under, or in connection with, any document contemplated hereby
to which the Owner Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided (i) in
accordance with the powers granted to and the authority conferred upon the Owner
Trustee pursuant to this Trust Agreement, (ii) in accordance with the Basic
Documents and (iii) in accordance with any document or instruction delivered to
the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 4.03; and no implied duties or obligations
shall be read into this Trust Agreement or any Basic Document against the Owner
Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no responsibility for filing any financing
or continuation statement in any public office at anytime or to otherwise
perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or lien granted to
it hereunder or to prepare or file any Securities and Exchange Commission filing
for the Trust or to record this Trust Agreement or any Basic Document.
Notwithstanding any provision herein or in any other Basic Document, the Owner
Trustee shall not be obligated to prepare, file or execute any documents or
certifications required to be filed by the Trust pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended. The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will, at
its own cost and expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to
discharge any liens on any part of the Owner Trust Estate that result from
actions by, or claims against, the Owner Trustee that are not related to the
ownership or the administration of the Owner Trust Estate.

         Section 4.05. Restrictions. (a) The Owner Trustee or the Depositor (or
an Affiliate thereof) shall not take any action (x) that is inconsistent with
the purposes of the Trust set forth in Section 2.03, (y) that, to the actual
knowledge of the Owner Trustee based on an Opinion of Counsel rendered by a law
firm generally recognized to be qualified to opine concerning the tax aspects of
asset securitization, would result in the Trust becoming taxable as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes or (z) would result in the amendment
or modification of this Trust Agreement. The Certificateholders shall not direct
the Owner Trustee to take action that would violate the provisions of this
Section 4.05.

         (b) The Owner Trustee shall not convey or transfer any of the Trust's
properties or assets, including those included in the Trust Estate, to any
person unless (a) it shall have received an Opinion of Counsel rendered by a law
firm generally recognized to be qualified to opine concerning the tax aspects of
asset securitization to the effect that such transaction will not have any
material adverse tax consequence to the Trust or any Certificateholder and (b)
such conveyance or transfer shall not violate the provisions of Section 3.16(b)
of the Indenture.

         Section 4.06. Prior Notice to Certificateholders with Respect to
Certain Matters. With respect to the following matters, the Owner Trustee shall
not take action unless at least 10 days before the taking of such action, the
Owner Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholders in writing of the
proposed action and the Certificateholders shall not have notified the Owner
Trustee in writing prior to the 10th day after such notice is given that such
Certificateholders have withheld consent or provided alternative direction:

         (a) the initiation of any claim or lawsuit by the Trust (except claims
or lawsuits brought in connection with the collection of cash distributions due
and owing under the Mortgage Loans) and the compromise of any action, claim or
lawsuit brought by or against the


<PAGE>

Trust (except with respect to the aforementioned claims or lawsuits for
collection of cash distributions due and owing under the Mortgage Loans);

         (b) the election by the Trust to file an amendment to the Certificate
of Trust (unless such amendment is required to be filed under the Statutory
Trust Statute);

         (c) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in
circumstances where the consent of any Noteholder is required;

         (d) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in
circumstances where the consent of any Noteholder is not required and such
amendment materially adversely affects the interest of the Certificateholders;
and

         (e) the appointment pursuant to the Indenture of a successor Note
Registrar, Paying Agent or Indenture Trustee or pursuant to this Trust Agreement
of a successor Certificate Registrar or Certificate Paying Agent or the consent
to the assignment by the Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Indenture Trustee,
Certificate Registrar or Certificate Paying Agent of its obligations under the
Indenture or this Trust Agreement, as applicable.

         Section 4.07. Action by Certificateholders with Respect to Certain
Matters. The Owner Trustee shall not have the power, except upon the direction
of the Certificateholders to (a) remove the Servicer under the Servicing
Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.01 and 8.05 thereof or (b) except as expressly
provided in the Basic Documents, sell the Mortgage Loans after the termination
of the Indenture. The Owner Trustee shall take the actions referred to in the
preceding sentence only upon written instructions signed by the
Certificateholders.

         Section 4.08. Action by Certificateholders with Respect to Bankruptcy.
The Owner Trustee shall not have the power to commence a voluntary proceeding in
bankruptcy relating to the Trust without the unanimous prior approval of all
Certificateholders and the consent of the Note Insurer, the Noteholders and the
Owner Trustee and the delivery to the Owner Trustee by each such
Certificateholder of a certificate certifying that such Certificateholder
reasonably believes that the Trust is insolvent. This paragraph shall survive
for one year following termination of this Trust Agreement.

         Section 4.09. Restrictions on Certificateholders' Power. The
Certificateholders shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take or to refrain from
taking any action if such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation
of the Trust or the Owner Trustee under this Trust Agreement or any of the Basic
Documents or would be contrary to Section 2.03, nor shall the Owner Trustee be
obligated to follow any such direction, if given.

         Section 4.10. Majority Control. Except as expressly provided herein,
any action that may be taken by the Certificateholders under this Trust
Agreement may be taken by the Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than a
majority Percentage Interest of the Certificates. Except as expressly provided
herein, any written notice of the Certificateholders delivered pursuant to this
Trust Agreement shall be effective if signed by Holders of Certificates
evidencing not less than a majority Percentage Interest of the Certificates at
the time of the delivery of such notice.

                           Application of Trust Funds
                           --------------------------

         Section 5.01. Distributions. (a) On each Payment Date, the Certificate
Paying Agent shall distribute to the Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis
based on the Certificate Percentage Interests thereof, all funds remaining on
deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account and available therefor (as
provided in Section 3.05 of the Indenture) for such Payment Date after payment
of any amount owing to the Owner Trustee hereunder and any Expenses of the Trust
remaining unpaid.

         (b) In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on the
distributions (or allocations of income) to a Certificateholder, such tax shall
reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance
with this Section 5.01. The Certificate Paying Agent is hereby authorized and
directed to retain or cause to be retained from amounts otherwise distributable
to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is
legally owed by the Trust (but such authorization shall not prevent the Owner
Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings, and withholding
payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such
proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to a
Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder
at the time it is withheld by the Certificate Paying Agent and remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a non-U.S.
Certificateholder), the Certificate Paying Agent may in its sole discretion
withhold such amounts in accordance with this paragraph (b).

         (c) Distributions to Certificateholders shall be subordinated to the
creditors of the Trust, including the Noteholders.

         Section 5.02. Method of Payment. Subject to Section 8.01(c),
distributions required to be made to Certificateholders on any Payment Date as
provided in Section 5.01 shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on
the preceding Record Date by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to
the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity having appropriate
facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have provided to the
Certificate Registrar appropriate written instructions at least five Business
Days prior to such Payment Date or, if not, by check mailed to such
Certificateholder at the address of such Holder appearing in the Certificate
Register.

         Section 5.03. Tax Returns. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Indenture
Trustee has agreed that it shall (a) maintain (or cause to be maintained) the
books of the Trust on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of
accounting, (b) deliver (or cause to be delivered) to each Noteholder and
Certificateholder as may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations, such information as may be required to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax returns, (c)
prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed such tax returns relating to
the Trust as may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations
(making such elections as may from time to time be required or appropriate under
any applicable state or federal statutes, rules or regulations) and (d) collect
or cause to be collected any withholding tax as described in and in accordance
with Section 5.01 of this Trust Agreement with respect to income or
distributions to Certificateholders and prepare or cause to


<PAGE>

be prepared the appropriate forms relating thereto; provided, however, that the
Indenture Trustee shall not be required to compute the Issuer's gross income
except to the extent it can do so without unreasonable effort or expense based
upon income statements furnished to it and provided, further, that the Indenture
Trustee shall not be required to prepare and file partnership tax returns on
behalf of the Issuer unless the Indenture Trustee receives an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to it (which shall not be at the Indenture Trustee's
expense, but shall be at the expense of the Depositor or other party furnishing
such opinion) as to the necessity of such filings. The Owner Trustee shall sign
all tax and information returns prepared or caused to be prepared by the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section 5.03 at the request of the Indenture
Trustee, and in doing so shall rely entirely upon, and shall have no liability
for information or calculations provided by, the Indenture Trustee.

         Section 5.04. Statements to Certificateholders. On each Payment Date,
the Certificate Paying Agent shall make available to each Certificateholder the
statement or statements provided to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Paying
Agent by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 7.05 of the Indenture with
respect to such Payment Date; provided, however, that in the event that any
monthly statement is no longer available, at the request of any
Certificateholder, the Indenture Trustee will deliver such monthly statement to
such Certificateholder.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          Concerning the Owner Trustee
                          ----------------------------

         Section 6.01. Acceptance of Trusts and Duties. The Owner Trustee

not be answerable or accountable hereunder or under any Basic Document under any
circumstances, except (i) for its own willful misconduct, gross negligence or

         (b) No provision of this Trust Agreement or any Basic Document shall
require the Owner Trustee to expend or risk funds or otherwise incur any

hereunder or under any Basic Document if the Owner Trustee shall have reasonable
grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against
such risk or liability is not reasonably assured or provided to it;

         (c) Under no circumstances shall the Owner Trustee be liable for
indebtedness evidenced by or arising under any of the Basic Documents, including
the principal of and interest on the Notes;

or sufficiency of the Basic Documents, the Notes, the Certificates, other than
the certificate of authentication on the Certificates, if executed and

<PAGE>

any Basic Document, at the request, order or direction of any of the
Certificateholders, unless such Certificateholders have offered to the Owner
Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and
liabilities that may be incurred by the Owner Trustee therein or thereby. The
right of the Owner Trustee to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this
Trust Agreement or in any Basic Document shall not be construed as a duty, and
the Owner Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its gross negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of any such act.

         Section 6.02. Furnishing of Documents. The Owner Trustee shall furnish
to the Noteholders, Beneficial Owners and Certificateholders promptly upon
receipt of a written reasonable request therefor, duplicates or copies of all
reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates, financial statements and any
other instruments furnished to the Owner Trustee under the Basic Documents.

         Section 6.03. Representations and Warranties. The Bank hereby
represents and warrants to the Depositor, for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and the Note Insurer, that:

         (a) It is a banking corporation duly organized and validly existing in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. It has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Trust Agreement;

         (b) It has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by it of this Trust Agreement, and this Trust Agreement
will be executed and delivered by one of its officers who is duly authorized to
execute and deliver this Trust Agreement on its behalf;

         (c) Neither the execution nor the delivery by it of this Trust
Agreement, nor the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
nor compliance by it with any of the terms or provisions hereof will contravene
any federal or Delaware law, governmental rule or regulation governing the
banking or trust powers of the Owner Trustee or any judgment or order binding on
it, or constitute any default under its charter documents or bylaws or any
indenture, mortgage, contract, agreement or instrument to which it is a party or
by which any of its properties may be bound;

         (d) This Trust Agreement assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Owner Trustee and the Depositor, constitutes a valid, legal and
binding obligation of the Owner Trustee, enforceable against it in accordance
with the terms hereof subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

         (e) The execution, delivery, authentication and performance by it of
this Trust Agreement will not require the authorization, consent or approval of,
the giving of notice to, the filing or registration with, or the taking of any
other action with respect to, any governmental authority or agency;

         (f) The Bank is not in default with respect to any order or decree of
any court or any order, regulation or demand of any Federal, state, municipal or
governmental agency, which default might have consequences that would materially
and adversely affect the condition


<PAGE>

(financial or other) or operations of the Bank or its properties or might have
consequences that would materially adversely affect its performance hereunder;
and

         (g) No litigation is pending or, to the best of the Bank's knowledge,
threatened against the Bank which would prohibit its entering into this Trust
Agreement or performing its obligations under this Trust Agreement.

         Section 6.04. Reliance; Advice of Counsel. (a) The Owner Trustee shall
incur no liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, notice,
resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, note, or
other document or paper believed by it to be genuine and believed by it to be
signed by the proper party or parties. The Owner Trustee may accept a certified
copy of a resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of any
corporate party as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly
adopted by such body and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any
fact or matter the method of determination of which is not specifically
prescribed herein, the Owner Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a
certificate, signed by the president or any vice president or by the treasurer
or other authorized officers of the relevant party, as to such fact or matter
and such certificate shall constitute full protection to the Owner Trustee for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.

         (b) In the exercise or administration of the Trust hereunder and in the
performance of its duties and obligations under this Trust Agreement or the
Basic Documents, the Owner Trustee (i) may act directly or through its agents,
attorneys, custodians or nominees (including persons acting under a power of
attorney) pursuant to agreements entered into with any of them, and the Owner
Trustee shall not be liable for the conduct or misconduct of such agents,
attorneys, custodians or nominees (including persons acting under a power of
attorney) if such persons have been selected by the Owner Trustee with
reasonable care, and (ii) may consult with counsel, accountants and other
skilled persons to be selected with reasonable care and employed by it. The
Owner Trustee shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good
faith by it in accordance with the opinion or advice of any such counsel,
accountants or other such Persons and not contrary to this Trust Agreement or
any Basic Document.

         Section 6.05. Not Acting in Individual Capacity. Except as provided in
this Article VI, in accepting the trusts hereby created Wilmington Trust Company
acts solely as Owner Trustee hereunder and not in its individual capacity, and
all Persons having any claim against the Owner Trustee by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Trust Agreement or any Basic Document shall
look only to the Owner Trust Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof.

         Section 6.06. Owner Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Related
Documents. The recitals contained herein and in the Certificates (other than the
signatures of the Owner Trustee on the Certificates) shall be taken as the
statements of the Depositor, and the Owner Trustee assumes no responsibility for
the correctness thereof. The Owner Trustee makes no representations as to the
validity or sufficiency of this Trust Agreement, of any Basic Document or of the
Certificates (other than the signatures of the Owner Trustee on the
Certificates) or the Notes, or of any Related Documents. The Owner Trustee shall
at no time have any responsibility or liability with respect to the sufficiency
of the Owner Trust Estate or its ability to generate the payments to be
distributed to Certificateholders under this Trust Agreement or the Noteholders
under the Indenture, including compliance by the Depositor or the Seller with
any warranty or


<PAGE>

representation made under any Basic Document or in any related document or the
accuracy of any such warranty or representation, or any action of the
Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar or the Indenture Trustee
taken in the name of the Owner Trustee.

         Section 6.07. Owner Trustee May Own Certificates and Notes. The Owner
Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may, subject to Section 3.05,
become the owner or pledgee of Certificates or Notes and may deal with the
Depositor, the Seller, the Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar
and the Indenture Trustee in transactions with the same rights as it would have
if it were not Owner Trustee.

         Section 6.08. Payments from Owner Trust Estate. All payments to be made
by the Owner Trustee under this Trust Agreement or any of the Basic Documents to
which the Owner Trustee is a party shall be made only from the income and
proceeds of the Owner Trust Estate or from other amounts required to be provided
by the Certificateholders and only to the extent that the Owner Trust shall have
received income or proceeds from the Owner Trust Estate or the
Certificateholders to make such payments in accordance with the terms hereof.
Wilmington Trust Company, in its individual capacity, shall not be liable for
any amounts payable under this Trust Agreement or any of the Basic Documents to
which the Owner Trustee is a party.

         Section 6.09. Doing Business in Other Jurisdictions. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, neither Wilmington Trust Company nor
the Owner Trustee shall be required to take any action in any jurisdiction other
than in the State of Delaware if the taking of such action will, even after the
appointment of a co-trustee or separate trustee in accordance with Section 9.05
hereof, (i) require the consent or approval or authorization or order of or the
giving of notice to, or the registration with or the taking of any other action
in respect of, any state or other governmental authority or agency of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; (ii) result in any fee, tax or
other governmental charge under the laws of the State of Delaware becoming
payable by Wilmington Trust Company; or (iii) subject Wilmington Trust Company
to personal jurisdiction in any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware
for causes of action arising from acts unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions by Wilmington Trust Company or the Owner Trustee, as the case may
be, contemplated hereby.

         Section 6.10. Liability of Certificate Registrar and Certificate Paying
Agent. All provisions affording protection or rights to or limiting the
liability of the Owner Trustee, including the provisions of this Agreement
permitting the Owner Trustee to resign, merge or consolidate, shall inure as
well to the Certificate Registrar and Certificate Paying Agent. In addition,
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in its capacities as Certificate Registrar
and Certificate Paying Agent hereunder shall be afforded all the rights,
protections, immunities and indemnities afforded to it in its capacity as
Indenture Trustee under the Indenture as if specifically set forth herein.

                          Compensation of Owner Trustee
                          -----------------------------

         Section 7.01. Owner Trustee Fees and Expenses. Pursuant to the separate
fee letter the Owner Trustee shall receive as compensation for its services
hereunder the Owner Trustee Fee from the Seller and the Owner Trustee shall be
reimbursed for its reasonable expenses hereunder and under the Basic Documents
from the Seller, including the reasonable compensation, expenses and
disbursements of such agents, representatives, experts and counsel as the Owner
Trustee may reasonably employ in connection with the exercise and performance of
its rights and its duties hereunder and under the Basic Documents. Any amounts
owing to the Owner Trustee hereunder and not otherwise paid shall be paid as
provided in Section 5.01 hereof.

         Section 7.02. Indemnification. The Seller and the Depositor shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
and the Certificate Paying Agent, and their respective successors, assigns,
agents and servants (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against,
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, taxes, claims, actions
and suits, and any and all reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Expenses") which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any Indemnified Party in any way relating to or arising out of
this Trust Agreement, the Basic Documents, the Owner Trust Estate, the
administration of the Owner Trust Estate or the action or inaction of the Owner
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Paying Agent, hereunder,
provided, that:

                  (i) the Seller and the Depositor shall not be liable for or
         required to indemnify an Indemnified Party from and against Expenses
         arising or resulting from the Owner Trustee's, the Certificate
         Registrar's or the Certificate Paying Agent's willful misconduct, gross
         negligence or bad faith or as a result of any inaccuracy of a
         representation or warranty of the Owner Trustee contained in Section
         6.03 expressly made by the Owner Trustee;

                  (ii) with respect to any such claim, the Indemnified Party
         shall have given the Depositor written notice thereof promptly after
         the Indemnified Party shall have actual knowledge thereof; provided,
         however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not eliminate
         its right to such indemnification unless the failure to notify is
         materially adverse to the indemnifying party,

                  (iii) while maintaining control over its own defense, the
         Seller and the Depositor shall consult with the Indemnified Party in
         preparing such defense; and

                  (iv) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
         contrary, the Seller and the Depositor shall not be liable for
         settlement of any claim by an Indemnified Party entered into without
         the prior consent of the Seller and the Depositor which consent shall
         not be unreasonably withheld.

<PAGE>

         The indemnities contained in this Section shall survive the resignation
or termination of the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the
Certificate Paying Agent or the termination of this Trust Agreement. In the
event of any claim, action or proceeding for which indemnity will be sought
pursuant to this Section 7.02, the Owner Trustee's, the Certificate Registrar's
or the Certificate Paying Agent's choice of legal counsel, if other than the
legal counsel retained by the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the
Certificate Paying Agent in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Trust Agreement, shall be subject to the approval of the Seller and the
Depositor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, upon
written notice to the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the
Certificate Paying Agent and with the consent of the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Paying Agent, as applicable, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Seller and the Depositor have
the right to assume the defense of any claim, action or proceeding against the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Paying Agent.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         Termination of Trust Agreement
                         ------------------------------

         Section 8.01. Termination of Trust Agreement. (a) This Trust Agreement
(other than Article VII) and the Trust shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect upon the earliest of (i) the final distribution of all moneys or
other property or proceeds of the Owner Trust Estate in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture and this Trust Agreement, (ii) the distribution of all of
the assets of the Owner Trust Estate, in accordance with written instructions
provided to the Owner Trustee by the Majority Certificateholder, following the
optional redemption of the Notes by the Issuer pursuant to Section 8.07 of the
Indenture; provided in each case that all amounts owing to the Noteholders and
the Note Insurer to the extent payable from the Owner Trust Estate or proceeds
thereof have been paid in full and that all obligations under the Indenture have
been discharged. The bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, death or incapacity
of any Certificateholder shall not (x) operate to terminate this Trust Agreement
or the Trust or (y) entitle such Certificateholder's legal representatives or
heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court
for a partition or winding up of all or any part of the Trust or the Owner Trust
Estate or (z) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties hereto.

         (b) Except as provided in Section 8.01(a), neither the Depositor nor
any Certificateholder shall be entitled to revoke or terminate the Trust.

         (c) Notice of any termination of the Trust, specifying the Payment Date
upon which Certificateholders shall surrender their Certificates to the
Certificate Paying Agent for payment of the final distribution and cancellation,
shall be given by the Certificate Paying Agent by letter to Certificateholders
mailed within five Business Days of receipt of notice of the final payment on
the Notes from the Indenture Trustee, stating (i) the Payment Date upon or with
respect to which final payment of the Certificates shall be made upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Certificate
Paying Agent therein designated, (ii) the amount of any such final payment and
(iii) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Payment Date is not
applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the
Certificates at the office of the Certificate Payment Agent therein specified.
The Certificate Paying Agent shall give such notice to the Owner Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar at the time such notice is given to Certificateholders.
Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Certificate Paying
Agent shall cause to be distributed to Certificateholders amounts distributable
on such Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.01.

         In the event that all of the Certificateholders shall not surrender
their Certificates for cancellation within six months after the date specified
in the above mentioned written notice, the Certificate Paying Agent shall give a
second written notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect
thereto. Subject to applicable laws with respect to escheat of funds, if within
one year following the Payment Date on which final payment of the Certificates
was to have been made pursuant to Section 3.03 of the Indenture, all the
Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate
Paying Agent may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take
appropriate steps, to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning
surrender of their Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the
funds and other assets that shall remain

<PAGE>

subject to this Trust Agreement. Any funds remaining in the Certificate
Distribution Account after exhaustion of such remedies shall be distributed by
the Certificate Paying Agent to the Depositor.

         (d) Upon the winding up of the Trust and its termination, and notice
thereof by the Majority Certificateholder, the Owner Trustee shall cause the
Certificate of Trust to be cancelled by filing a certificate of cancellation
with the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of Section 3810(c)
of the Statutory Trust Statute.

                                   ARTICLE IX

             Successor Owner Trustees and Additional Owner Trustees
             ------------------------------------------------------

         Section 9.01. Eligibility Requirements for Owner Trustee. The Owner
Trustee shall at all times be a corporation satisfying the provisions of Section
3807(a) of the Statutory Trust Statute; authorized to exercise corporate trust
powers; having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and
having (or having a parent that has) a rating of at least Baa3 by Moody's or is
otherwise acceptable to the Rating Agencies and the Note Insurer. If such
corporation shall publish reports of condition at least annually pursuant to law
or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then
for the purpose of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the
Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 9.01, the Owner Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and
with the effect specified in Section 9.02.

         Section 9.02. Replacement of Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee may at
any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby created by giving 30
days prior written notice thereof to the Depositor. Upon receiving such notice
of resignation, the Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor Owner Trustee,
by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the resigning Owner Trustee and to the successor Owner Trustee. If
no successor Owner Trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted
appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Owner Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Owner Trustee.

         If at any time the Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.01 and shall fail to resign after
written request therefor by the Depositor, or if at any time the Owner Trustee
shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a
receiver of the Owner Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any
public officer shall take charge or control of the Owner Trustee or of its
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, then the Depositor may remove the Owner Trustee.

         Any resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee and appointment of a
successor Owner Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall
not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Owner
Trustee pursuant to Section 9.03 and payment of all fees and expenses owed to
the outgoing Owner Trustee. The Servicer shall provide notice of such
resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee to each of the Rating Agencies.

         Section 9.03. Successor Owner Trustee. Any successor Owner Trustee
appointed pursuant to Section 9.02 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the
Indenture Trustee and to its predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting
such appointment under this Trust Agreement, and thereupon the resignation or
removal of the predecessor Owner Trustee shall become effective, and such
successor Owner Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its


<PAGE>

predecessor under this Trust Agreement, with like effect as if originally named
as Owner Trustee. The predecessor Owner Trustee shall upon payment of its fees
and expenses deliver to the successor Owner Trustee all documents and statements
and monies held by it under this Trust Agreement; and the predecessor Owner
Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as
may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the
successor Owner Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

         No successor Owner Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section 9.03 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Owner Trustee
shall be eligible pursuant to Section 9.01.

         Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Owner Trustee pursuant to
this Section 9.03, the Owner Trustee shall mail notice thereof to all
Certificateholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders, the Note Insurer and
the Rating Agencies.

         Section 9.04. Merger or Consolidation of Owner Trustee. Any Person into
which the Owner Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any Person
succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Owner Trustee, shall be the successor of the Owner Trustee hereunder, without
the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any
of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding;
provided, that such Person shall be eligible pursuant to Section 9.01 and,
provided, further, that the Owner Trustee shall mail notice of such merger or
consolidation to the Rating Agencies and the Note Insurer.

         Section 9.05. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, at any time, for
the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any
part of the Owner Trust Estate may at the time be located, the Owner Trustee
shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint
one or more Persons to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or as
separate trustee or trustees, of all or any part of the Owner Trust Estate, and
to vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title to the Trust or any part
thereof and, subject to the other provisions of this Section, such powers,
duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Owner Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Trust
Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor
Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 9.01 and no notice of the appointment of any
co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to Section 9.03.

         Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:

         (a) All rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised or performed by the
Owner Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being
understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act
separately without the Owner Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent
that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are
to be performed, the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to
perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
obligations (including the holding of title to the


<PAGE>

Owner Trust Estate or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be
exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but
solely at the direction of the Owner Trustee;

         (b) No trustee under this Trust Agreement shall be personally liable by
reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under this Trust Agreement;
and

         (c) The Owner Trustee may at any time accept the resignation of or
remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

         Any notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee shall
be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Trust
Agreement and the conditions of this Article. Each separate trustee and
co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with
the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either
jointly with the Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein,
subject to all the provisions of this Trust Agreement, specifically including
every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting
the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such
instrument shall be filed with the Owner Trustee.

         Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Owner
Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Trust Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or
co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of
its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be
exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the
appointment of a new or successor co-trustee or separate trustee.

                                  -------------

         Section 10.01. Amendments. (a) This Trust Agreement may be amended from
time to time by the parties hereto as specified in this Section, provided that
any amendment, except as provided in subparagraph (e) below, be accompanied by
an Opinion of Counsel addressed to the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
and the Certificate Paying Agent and obtained by the Servicer to the effect that
such amendment (i) complies with the provisions of this Section and (ii) if Home
Loan and Investment Bank, F.S.B. is not the Majority Certificateholder, would
not cause the Trust to be subject to an entity level tax for federal income tax
purposes.

         (b) If the purpose of the amendment (as detailed therein) is to correct
any mistake, eliminate any inconsistency, cure any ambiguity or deal with any
matter not covered (i.e. to give effect to the intent of the parties and, if
applicable, to the expectations of the Holders), it shall not be necessary to
obtain the consent of any Holders, but the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar and the Certificate Paying Agent shall be furnished with (A) a letter
from the Rating Agencies that the amendment will not result in the downgrading
or withdrawal of the rating then assigned to any Note (without giving effect to
the Note Insurance Policy) or (B) an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Servicer
to the effect that such action will not adversely affect in any material respect
the interests of any Holders.

         (c) If the purpose of the amendment is to prevent the imposition of any
federal or state taxes at any time that any Security is outstanding, it shall
not be necessary to obtain the consent of any Holder, but the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Paying Agent shall be furnished with
an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Servicer that such amendment is necessary
or helpful to prevent the imposition of such taxes and is not materially adverse
to any Holder.

         (d) If the purpose of the amendment is to add or eliminate or change
any provision of the Trust Agreement other than as contemplated in (b) and (c)
above, the amendment shall require (A) an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the
Servicer to the effect that such action will not adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Holders of the Notes and Certificates or
the Note Insurer and (B) either (a) a letter from the Rating Agency that the
amendment will not result in the downgrading or withdrawal of the rating then
assigned to any Note without regard to the Note Insurance Policy or (b) the
consent of Holders of Certificates evidencing a majority Percentage Interest of
the Certificates, the Note Insurer and the Indenture Trustee; provided, however,
that no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay
the timing of, payments received that are required to be distributed on any
Certificate without the consent of the related Certificateholder, or (ii) reduce
the aforesaid percentage of Certificates the Holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment, without the consent of the Holders of all such
Certificates then outstanding.

         (e) If the purpose of the amendment is to provide for the holding of
any of the Certificates in book-entry form, it shall require the consent of
Holders of all such Certificates then outstanding; provided, that the Opinion of
Counsel specified in subparagraph (a) above shall not be required.

<PAGE>

         (f) If the purpose of the amendment is to provide for the issuance of
additional certificates representing an interest in the Trust, it shall not be
necessary to obtain the consent of any Holder, but the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee shall be furnished with (A) an Opinion of Counsel obtained by
the Servicer to the effect that such action will not adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Holders, (B) an Opinion of Counsel
obtained by the Servicer to the effect that such action will not cause the Trust
to be (i) treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income
tax and relevant state income and franchise tax purposes or (ii) taxable as a
"publicly traded partnership" as defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.7704-1
for federal income tax purposes and relevant state franchise or income tax
purposes and (C) a letter from the Rating Agencies that the amendment will not
result in the downgrading or withdrawal of the rating then assigned to any Notes
without regard to the Note Insurance Policy or the rating then assigned to the
Notes.

         (g) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent, the
Servicer shall furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment
or consent to each Certificateholder, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer
and each of the Rating Agencies. It shall not be necessary for the consent of
Certificateholders or the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section 10.01 to
approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it shall
be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The manner of
obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Certificateholders provided
for in this Trust Agreement or in any other Basic Document) and of evidencing
the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be
subject to such reasonable requirements as the Owner Trustee may prescribe.

         (h) In connection with the execution of any amendment to any agreement
to which the Trust is a party, other than this Trust Agreement, the Owner
Trustee shall be entitled to receive and conclusively rely upon an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such amendment is authorized or permitted by the
documents subject to such amendment and that all conditions precedent in the
Basic Documents for the execution and delivery thereof by the Trust or the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, have been satisfied.

         (i) No amendment or agreement affecting the rights or duties of the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Paying Agent may be
entered into without the consent of the affected party.

         Promptly after the execution of any amendment to the Certificate of
Trust, the Owner Trustee shall cause the filing of such amendment with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

         Section 10.02. No Legal Title to Owner Trust Estate. The
Certificateholders shall not have legal title to any part of the Owner Trust
Estate solely by virtue of their status as a Certificateholder. The
Certificateholders shall be entitled to receive distributions with respect to
their undivided beneficial interest therein only in accordance with Articles V
and VIII. No transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of any right, title or
interest of the Certificateholders to and in their ownership interest in the
Owner Trust Estate shall operate to terminate this Trust Agreement or the trusts
hereunder or entitle any transferee to an accounting or to the transfer to it of

                                             this Certificate:______________ %

Cut-off Date: November 30, 2004
Date of Amended and Restated
 Trust Agreement:                            First Payment Date:
December 16, 2004                            January 17, 2005
Servicer: Home Loan and Investment Bank,
F.S.B.                                       Certificate Interest Rate: Variable

                   HOME LOAN MORTGAGE LOAN TRUST SERIES 2004-2

         Evidencing a fractional undivided equity interest in the Owner Trust
Estate, the property of which consists primarily of the Mortgage Loans in Home
Loan Mortgage Loan Trust Series 2004-2 (the "Trust"), a Delaware statutory trust
formed by Financial Asset Securities Corp., as depositor, pursuant to the Trust
Agreement referred to below.

         This certifies that _______________________ is the registered owner of
the Percentage Interest represented hereby.

         The Trust was created pursuant to a Short Form Trust Agreement, dated
as of December 16, 2004, between the Depositor and Wilmington Trust Company, as
owner trustee (the "Owner Trustee", which term includes any successor entity
under the Trust Agreement) (the "Short Form Trust Agreement") as amended and
restated by the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated as of December 16,
2004 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, together with the Short
Form Trust Agreement, the "Trust Agreement") among the Depositor, the Owner
Trustee and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as certificate registrar and
certificate paying agent, a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of
which is set forth hereinafter. This Certificate is issued under and is subject
to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement, to which Trust
Agreement the Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof
assents and by which such Holder is bound.

         This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Trust
Certificates, Series 2004-2 (herein called the "Certificates") issued under the
Trust Agreement to which reference is hereby made for a statement of the
respective rights thereunder of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee and the Holders
of the Certificates and the terms upon which the Certificates are executed and
delivered. All terms used in this Certificate which are defined in the Trust
Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Trust Agreement. The
Owner Trust Estate consists of the Mortgage Loans in the Home Loan Mortgage Loan
Trust 2004-2 and a Note Insurance Policy. The rights of the Holders of the
Certificates are subordinated to the rights of the Holders of the Notes, as set
forth in the Indenture.

         There will be distributed on the 15th day of each month or, if such
15th day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day (each, a "Payment Date"),
commencing on January 17, 2005, to the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered at the close of business on the

                                      A-3
<PAGE>

last Business Day of the month immediately preceding such Payment Date (the
"Record Date"), such Certificateholder's Percentage Interest in the amount to be
distributed to Certificateholders on such Payment Date.

         The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees
that it will look solely to the funds on deposit in the Payment Account that
have been released from the Lien of the Indenture for payment hereunder and that
neither the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity nor the Depositor is
personally liable to the Certificateholders for any amount payable under this
Certificate or the Trust Agreement or, except as expressly provided in the Trust
Agreement, subject to any liability under the Trust Agreement.

         The Holder of this Certificate acknowledges and agrees that its rights
to receive distributions in respect of this Certificate are subordinated to the
rights of the Noteholders as described in the Indenture, dated as of December
16, 2004, between the Trust and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as
Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture").

         The Depositor and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a
Certificate, agree to treat, and to take no action inconsistent with the
treatment of, the Certificates for federal, state and local income tax purposes
as an equity interest in the Trust.

         Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate, covenants
and agrees that such Certificateholder will not at any time institute against
the Depositor, or join in any institution against the Depositor or the Trust of,
any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States federal or state
bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the
Certificates, the Notes, the Trust Agreement or any of the Basic Documents.

         Distributions on this Certificate will be made as provided in the Trust
Agreement by the Certificate Paying Agent by wire transfer or check mailed to
the Certificateholder of record in the Certificate Register without the
presentation or surrender of this Certificate or the making of any notation
hereon. Except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement and notwithstanding
the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be made after due
notice by the Certificate Paying Agent of the pendency of such distribution and
only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency
maintained by the Certificate Registrar for that purpose by the Trust, as
provided in Section 3.09 of the Trust Agreement.

         Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate
will be made after due notice of the pendency of such distribution and only upon
presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency specified
in such notice.

         No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of a Certificate shall
be made unless such transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws or is made in accordance with said Act and laws. In the event of
any such transfer, the Certificate Registrar or the Depositor shall prior to
such transfer require the transferee to execute (A) either (i) (a) an investment
letter in substantially the form attached to the Agreement as Exhibit C (or in
such form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and
the Depositor) which investment letter


                                      A-4
<PAGE>

shall not be an expense of the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar, the Servicer or the Depositor and which investment letter states
that, among other things, such transferee (1) is a "qualified institutional
buyer" as defined under Rule 144A, acting for its own account or the accounts of
other "qualified institutional buyers" as defined under Rule 144A, and (2) is
aware that the proposed transferor intends to rely on the exemption from
registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided
by Rule 144A or (ii) (a) a written Opinion of Counsel acceptable to and in form
and substance satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor that
such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption, describing the applicable
exemption and the basis therefor, from said Act and laws or is being made
pursuant to said Act and laws, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense
of the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer or the
Depositor and (b) the transferee executes a representation letter, substantially
in the form of Exhibit D to the Agreement, and the transferor executes a
representation letter, substantially in the form of Exhibit E to the Agreement,
each acceptable to and in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate
Registrar and the Depositor certifying the facts surrounding such transfer,
which representation letters shall not be an expense of the Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer or the Depositor and (B) the
Certificate of Non-Foreign Status (in substantially the form attached to the
Agreement as Exhibit D) acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor, which certificate
shall not be an expense of the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar or the Depositor. The Holder of a Certificate desiring to effect such
transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate
Registrar, the Servicer and the Depositor against any liability that may result
if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal
and state laws.

         No transfer of Certificates or any interest therein shall be made to
any Person unless the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
and the Servicer are provided with an Opinion of Counsel which establishes to
the satisfaction of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
and the Servicer that the purchase of Certificates is permissible under
applicable law, will not constitute or result in any prohibited transaction
under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and will not subject the Depositor, the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the Servicer to any obligation or
liability (including obligations or liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) in addition to those undertaken in the Trust Agreement, which Opinion
of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar or the Servicer. In lieu of such Opinion of Counsel, a
Person may provide a certification in the form of Exhibit G to the Agreement,
which the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the
Servicer may rely upon without further inquiry or investigation. Neither an
Opinion of Counsel nor a certification will be required in connection with the
initial transfer of any such Certificate by the Depositor to an affiliate of the
Depositor (in which case, the Depositor or any affiliate thereof shall have
deemed to have represented that such affiliate is not a Plan or a Person
investing Plan Assets of any Plan) and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
conclusively rely upon a representation (which, upon the request of the Owner
Trustee, shall be a written representation) from the Depositor of the status of
such transferee as an affiliate of the Depositor.

         No offer, sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition
(including any pledge, sale or transfer under a repurchase transaction or
securities loan) of any Certificate shall be made


                                      A-5
<PAGE>

to any transferee unless, prior to such disposition, the proposed transferor
delivers to the Owner Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, rendered by a law firm
generally recognized to be qualified to opine concerning the tax aspects of
asset securitization, to the effect that such transfer (including any
disposition permitted following any default under any pledge or repurchase
transaction) will not cause the Trust to be (i) treated as an association
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax and relevant state income and
franchise tax purposes or (ii) taxable as a "publicly traded partnership" as
defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.7704-1 for federal income tax purposes
and relevant state franchise or income tax purposes.

         Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

         Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been
executed by an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, or an authenticating
agent by manual signature, this Certificate shall not entitle the Holder hereof
to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

         THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE
OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

                            [REVERSE OF CERTIFICATE]

         The Certificates do not represent an obligation of, or an interest in,
the Depositor, the Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the Certificate
Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee or any Affiliates of
any of them and no recourse may be had against such parties or their assets,
except as expressly set forth or contemplated herein or in the Trust Agreement
or the Basic Documents. In addition, this Certificate is not guaranteed by any
governmental agency or instrumentality and is limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries with respect to the Mortgage Loans, all as
more specifically set forth herein and in the Trust Agreement. A copy of the
Trust Agreement may be examined by any Certificateholder upon written request
during normal business hours at the principal office of the Depositor and at
such other places, if any, designated by the Depositor.

         The Trust Agreement permits the amendment thereof as specified below,
provided that any amendment be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel to the Owner
Trustee to the effect that such amendment complies with the provisions of the
Trust Agreement and, if Home Loan and Investment Bank, F.S.B. was not the
Majority Certificateholder, would not cause the Trust to be subject to an entity
level tax. If the purpose of the amendment is to correct any mistake, eliminate
any inconsistency, cure any ambiguity or deal with any matter not covered, it
shall not be necessary to obtain the consent of any Holder, but the Owner
Trustee shall be furnished with a letter from the Rating Agencies that the
amendment will not result in the downgrading or withdrawal of the rating then
assigned to any Note or the rating then assigned to any Note without taking into
account the Note Insurance Policy. If the purpose of the amendment is to prevent
the imposition of any federal or state taxes at any time that any Security is
outstanding, it shall not be necessary to obtain the consent of the any Holder,
but the Owner Trustee shall be furnished with an Opinion of Counsel that such
amendment is necessary or helpful to prevent the imposition of such taxes and is
not materially adverse to any Holder. If the purpose of the amendment is to add
or eliminate or change any provision of the Trust Agreement, other than as
specified in the preceding two sentences, the amendment shall require either (a)
a letter from the Rating Agencies that the amendment will not result in the
downgrading or withdrawal of the rating then assigned to any Note without regard
to the Note Insurance Policy or the rating then assigned to any Note or (b) the
consent of Holders of the Certificates evidencing a majority of the Percentage
Interests of the Certificates and the Indenture Trustee; PROVIDED, however, that
no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the
time of, payments received that are required to be distributed on any
Certificate without the consent of the related Certificateholder, or (ii) reduce
the aforesaid percentage of Certificates the Holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment without the consent of the Holders of all such
Certificates then outstanding.

         As provided in the Trust Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registerable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies of the Certificate Registrar maintained by
the Trust, as provided in the Trust Agreement, accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of authorized denominations
evidencing the same aggregate interest in the Trust


                                      A-8
<PAGE>

will be issued to the designated transferee. The initial Certificate Registrar
appointed under the Trust Agreement is Deutsche Bank National Trust Company.

         Except as provided in the Trust Agreement, the Certificates are
issuable only in a minimum Certificate Percentage Interest of 10%. As provided
in the Trust Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth,
Certificates are exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized denominations
evidencing the same aggregate denomination, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for any such registration
of transfer or exchange, but the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

         The Owner Trustee, the Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Paying Agent, or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Owner Trustee,
the Certificate Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar or any such agent shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary.

         The obligations and responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement and
the Trust created thereby shall terminate as and when provided in accordance
with the terms of the Trust Agreement.

         ______________________________________________________________

         ______________________________________________________________

         ______________________________________________________________

                  The undersigned seller, as registered holder (the "Seller"),
intends to transfer the Rule 144A Securities described above to the undersigned
buyer (the "Buyer").

                  1. In connection with such transfer and in accordance with the
agreements pursuant to which the Rule 144A Securities were issued, the Seller
hereby certifies the following facts: Neither the Seller nor anyone acting on
its behalf has offered, transferred, pledged, sold or otherwise disposed of the
Rule 144A Securities, any interest in the Rule 144A Securities or any other
similar security to, or solicited any offer to buy or accept a transfer, pledge
or other disposition of the Rule 144A Securities, any interest in the Rule 144A
Securities or any other similar security from, or otherwise approached or
negotiated with respect to the Rule 144A Securities, any interest in the Rule
144A Securities or any other similar security with, any person in any manner, or
made any general solicitation by means of general advertising or in any other
manner, or taken any other action, that would constitute a distribution of the
Rule 144A Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933
Act"), or that would render the disposition of the Rule 144A Securities a
violation of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or require registration pursuant thereto,
and that the Seller has not offered the Rule 144A Securities to any person other
than the Buyer or another "qualified institutional buyer" as defined in Rule
144A under the 1933 Act.

                  2. The Buyer warrants and represents to, and covenants with,
the Owner Trustee and the Depositor (as defined in the Amended and Restated
Trust Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of December 16, 2004, among
Financial Asset Securities Corp., as Depositor, Wilmington Trust Company, as
Owner Trustee, and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Certificate
Registrar and Certificate Paying Agent) pursuant to Section 3.05 of the
Agreement and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as indenture trustee, as
follows:

                           a. The Buyer understands that the Rule 144A
         Securities have not been registered under the 1933 Act or the
         securities laws of any state.

                           b. The Buyer considers itself a substantial,
         sophisticated institutional investor having such knowledge and
         experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
         evaluating the merits and risks of investment in the Rule 144A
         Securities.


                                       C-1
<PAGE>

                           c. The Buyer has been furnished with all information
         regarding the Rule 144A Securities that it has requested from the
         Seller, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or the Servicer.

                           d. Neither the Buyer nor anyone acting on its behalf
         has offered, transferred, pledged, sold or otherwise disposed of the
         Rule 144A Securities, any interest in the Rule 144A Securities or any
         other similar security to, or solicited any offer to buy or accept a
         transfer, pledge or other disposition of the Rule 144A Securities, any
         interest in the Rule 144A Securities or any other similar security
         from, or otherwise approached or negotiated with respect to the Rule
         144A Securities, any interest in the Rule 144A Securities or any other
         similar security with, any person in any manner, or made any general
         solicitation by means of general advertising or in any other manner, or
         taken any other action, that would constitute a distribution of the
         Rule 144A Securities under the 1933 Act or that would render the
         disposition of the Rule 144A Securities a violation of Section 5 of the
         1933 Act or require registration pursuant thereto, nor will it act, nor
         has it authorized or will it authorize any person to act, in such
         manner with respect to the Rule 144A Securities.

                           e. The Buyer is a "qualified institutional buyer" as
         that term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act and has completed
         either of the forms of certification to that effect attached hereto as
         Annex 1 or Annex 2. The Buyer is aware that the sale to it is being
         made in reliance on Rule 144A. The Buyer is acquiring the Rule 144A
         Securities for its own account or the accounts of other qualified
         institutional buyers, understands that such Rule 144A Securities may be
         resold, pledged or transferred only (i) to a person reasonably believed
         to be a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own
         account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom
         notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in
         reliance on Rule 144A, or (ii) pursuant to another exemption from
         registration under the 1933 Act.

                  3. The Buyer warrants and represents to, and covenants with,
the Seller, the Indenture Trustee, Owner Trustee, Servicer and the Depositor
that either (1) the Buyer is (A) not an employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")), or a plan (within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("Code")), which (in either case) is subject
to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (both a "Plan"), and (B) is not directly or
indirectly purchasing the Rule 144A Securities on behalf of, as investment
manager of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a
Plan, or (2) the Buyer understands that registration of transfer of any Rule
144A Securities to any Plan, or to any Person acting on behalf of any Plan, will
not be made unless such Plan delivers an opinion of its counsel, addressed and
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee, the Servicer and
the Depositor, to the effect that the purchase and holding of the Rule 144A
Securities by, on behalf of or with "plan assets" of any Plan is permissible
under applicable law, would not constitute or result in a prohibited transaction
under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and would not subject the Depositor,
the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the Servicer to any obligation
or liability (including liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in
addition to those undertaken in the Agreement, which Opinion of Counsel shall
not be an expense of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar
or the Servicer.

                                       C-4
<PAGE>

  ___    State or Local Plan. The Buyer is a plan established and maintained by

         and maintained by a State, its political subdivisions, or any agency or
         instrumentality of the State or its political subdivisions, for the
         benefit of its employees, or (b) employee benefit plans within the
         meaning of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

of such securities to the Buyer and did not include any of the securities
referred to in the preceding paragraph. Further, in determining such aggregate
amount, the Buyer may have included securities owned by subsidiaries of the
Buyer, but only if such subsidiaries are consolidated with the Buyer in its
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and if the investments of such subsidiaries are managed under the
Buyer's direction. However, such securities were not included if the Buyer is a
majority-owned, consolidated subsidiary of another enterprise and the Buyer is
not itself a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

         5. The Buyer acknowledges that it is familiar with Rule 144A and
understands that the seller to it and other parties related to the Certificates
are relying and will continue to rely on the statements made herein because one
or more sales to the Buyer may be in reliance on Rule 144A.

  ______  ______    Will the Buyer be purchasing the Rule 144A
    Yes     No      Securities only for the Buyer's own account?


                                       C-5
<PAGE>

         6. If the answer to the foregoing question is "no", the Buyer agrees
that, in connection with any purchase of securities sold to the Buyer for the
account of a third party (including any separate account) in reliance on Rule
144A, the Buyer will only purchase for the account of a third party that at the
time is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A. In
addition, the Buyer agrees that the Buyer will not purchase securities for a
third party unless the Buyer has obtained a current representation letter from
such third party or taken other appropriate steps contemplated by Rule 144A to
conclude that such third party independently meets the definition of "qualified
institutional buyer" set forth in Rule 144A.

         7. The Buyer will notify each of the parties to which this
certification is made of any changes in the information and conclusions herein.
Until such notice is given, the Buyer's purchase of Rule 144A Securities will
constitute a reaffirmation of this certification as of the date of such

                  Section 2.03. ACCEPTANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS BY INDENTURE

                  (a)      The Indenture Trustee acknowledges receipt of,
subject to the exceptions it notes pursuant to the procedures described below,
the documents (or certified copies thereof) referred to in Section 2.3 of the
Purchase Agreement, and declares that it holds and will continue to hold those

assets of the Trust Estate as Indenture Trustee in trust for the use and benefit
of all present and future Holders of the Notes and the Note Insurer.


                                       4

                  The parties hereto understand and agree that it is not
intended that any Mortgage Loan be included in the Trust that is a "High-Cost
Home Loan" as defined by the Homeownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 or
any other applicable predatory or abusive lending laws.

                  The Indenture Trustee agrees, for the benefit of the
Noteholders and the Note Insurer, to review each Mortgage File on or before the
Closing Date, with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans, or the applicable
Subsequent Transfer Date, with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans, and to
certify in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 that, as to
each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other than any Mortgage
Loan specifically identified in the exception report annexed thereto as not
being covered by such certification), (i) all documents constituting part of
such Mortgage File (other than such documents described in Section 2.3(e) and
(f) of the Purchase Agreement, with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans, and
each Subsequent Transfer Agreement, with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans) required to be delivered to it pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, with
respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans, and each Subsequent Transfer Agreement,
with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans are in its possession, (ii) such
documents have been reviewed by it and appear regular on their face and relate
to such Mortgage Loan and (iii) based on its examination and only as to the
foregoing, the information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule that
corresponds to items (iii), (vii), and (viii) of the definition of "Mortgage
Loan Schedule" accurately reflects information set forth in the Mortgage File.
It is herein acknowledged that, in conducting such review, the Indenture Trustee
was under no duty or obligation (i) to inspect, review or examine any such
documents, instruments, certificates or other papers to determine whether they
are genuine, enforceable, or appropriate for the represented purpose or whether
they have actually been recorded or that they are other than what they purport
to be on their face or (ii) to determine whether any Mortgage File should
include any of the documents specified in clauses (e) and (f) of Section 2.3 of
the Purchase Agreement, with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans, and each
Subsequent Transfer Agreement, with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

                  On or prior to the first anniversary date of this Indenture,
the Indenture Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor, the Note Insurer and the
Servicer a final certification in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit C-2
evidencing the completeness of the Mortgage Files, with any applicable
exceptions noted thereon, and the Servicer shall forward a copy thereof to any
Sub-Servicer.

                  If in the process of reviewing the Mortgage Files and making
or preparing, as the case may be, the certifications referred to above, the
Indenture Trustee finds any document or documents constituting a part of a
Mortgage File to be missing or defective in any material respect, at the
conclusion of its review the Indenture Trustee shall so notify the Depositor,
the Note Insurer and the Servicer. In addition, upon the actual knowledge of a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Seller in the Purchase Agreement,
with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans, and each Subsequent Transfer
Agreement, with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans in respect of any
Mortgage Loan which materially adversely affects such Mortgage Loan or the
interests of the Noteholders or the Note Insurer in such Mortgage Loan, the
Person discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Note Insurer and the Seller.


                                       5

                  (b)      The Indenture Trustee agrees, for the benefit of
Noteholders and the Note Insurer, within 90 days after execution and delivery of
this Indenture, to review the Mortgage Files to ascertain that all required
documents set forth in paragraphs (a) - (d) of Section 2.3 of the Purchase
Agreement have been executed and received, and that such documents relate to the
Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule and that the Mortgage
Notes have been endorsed as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Purchase Agreement,
and in so doing the Indenture Trustee may rely on the purported due execution
and genuineness of any signature thereon. If within such 90-day period the
Indenture Trustee finds any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File not
to have been executed or received or to be unrelated to the Mortgage Loans
identified in said Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly
upon the conclusion of its review notify the Seller, the Depositor and the Note
Insurer, and the Seller shall have a period of 90 days after such notice within
which to correct or cure any such defect.

                  The Indenture Trustee shall have no responsibility for
reviewing any Mortgage File except as expressly provided in subsection (b) of
this Section 2.03. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, in
reviewing any Mortgage File pursuant to such subsection, the Indenture Trustee
shall have no responsibility for determining whether any document is valid and
binding, whether the text of any assignment or endorsement is in proper or
recordable form (except, if applicable, to determine if the Indenture Trustee is
the assignee or endorsee), whether any document has been recorded in accordance
with the requirements of any applicable jurisdiction, or whether a blanket
assignment is permitted in any applicable jurisdiction, but shall only be
required to determine whether a document has been executed, that it appears to
be what it purports to be, and, where applicable, that it purports to be
recorded, but shall not be required to determine whether any Person executing
any document is authorized to do so or whether any signature thereon is genuine.

                  (c)      Upon deposit of the Purchase Price in the Collection
Account, and, upon receipt by the Indenture Trustee of written notification of
such deposit, signed by an officer of the Seller, the Indenture Trustee shall
release to the Seller the related Mortgage File and the Indenture Trustee shall
execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse, furnished to it by the Seller as are necessary to vest in the
Seller or its designee any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto. It is
understood and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to purchase any Mortgage
Loan as to which a material defect in or omission of a constituent document
exists shall constitute the sole remedy against the Seller respecting such
defect or omission available to the Note Insurer, the Noteholders or the
Indenture Trustee on behalf of Noteholders.

                  Section 2.04. ACCEPTANCE OF CORRIDOR CONTRACT BY INDENTURE
TRUSTEE. The Issuer hereby directs the Indenture Trustee to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Corridor Contract on the Closing Date and
thereafter on behalf of the Holders of the Notes. The Issuer and the Holders of
the Notes by their acceptance of such Notes acknowledge and agree that the
Indenture Trustee shall execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the
Corridor Contract and shall do so solely in its capacity as Indenture Trustee of
the Trust and not in its individual capacity.

                  The Indenture Trustee acknowledges receipt of the Corridor
Contract and declares that it holds and will continue to hold this document and
any amendments, replacements or


                                       6
<PAGE>


supplements thereto and all other assets of the Trust Estate as Indenture
Trustee in trust for the use and benefit of all present and future Holders of
the Notes. Every provision of this Indenture affording protection to the
Indenture Trustee shall apply to the Indenture Trustee's execution of the
Corridor Contract and the performance of its duties and satisfaction of its
obligations thereunder.

                  Section 2.05. CONVEYANCE OF SUBSEQUENT MORTGAGE LOANS.

                  (a)      Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in paragraph (b) below and pursuant to the terms of each Subsequent
Transfer Agreement, in consideration of the Indenture Trustee's delivery, on
behalf of the Trust, on the related Subsequent Transfer Date to or upon the
order of the Seller of the purchase price therefor, the Seller shall on any
Subsequent Transfer Date sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey
without recourse to the Trust, (i) all right, title and interest of the Seller
in and to each Subsequent Mortgage Loan transferred pursuant to such Subsequent
Transfer Agreement, including the related Cut-Off Date Principal Balance and all
interest accruing thereon after the related Due Date in the calendar month
preceding the Subsequent Transfer Date and all collections in respect of
principal received after the related Cut-Off Date (other than payments in
respect of accrued interest on such Subsequent Mortgage Loans through the
related Due Date in the calendar month preceding the Subsequent Transfer Date);
(ii) property which secured such Subsequent Mortgage Loan and which has been
acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure; (iii) its interest in
any insurance policies in respect of such Subsequent Mortgage Loans; and (iv)
all proceeds of any of the foregoing. The transfer by the Seller to the Trust of
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans set forth in the Subsequent Transfer Agreement
shall be absolute and shall be intended by the Seller and all parties hereto to
be treated as a sale by the Seller to the Trust. If the assignment and transfer
of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the other property specified in this
Section 2.05 from the Seller to the Trust pursuant to the Subsequent Transfer
Instrument is held or deemed not to be a sale or is held or deemed to be a
pledge of security for a loan, the Seller intends that the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be established pursuant to the terms of the
Subsequent Transfer Instrument and that, in such event, (i) the Seller shall be
deemed to have granted and does hereby grant to the Trust as of such Subsequent
Transfer Date a first priority security interest in the entire right, title and
interest of the Seller in and to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and all other
property conveyed to the Trust pursuant to this Section 2.05 and all proceeds
thereof and (ii) the Subsequent Transfer Instrument shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law. The purchase price shall be one hundred percent
(100%) of the Cut-Off Date Principal Balances of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans.
On or before each Subsequent Transfer Date, the Seller shall deliver to, and
deposit with the Indenture Trustee, the Related Documents with respect to each
Subsequent Mortgage Loan transferred on such Subsequent Transfer Date, and the
Mortgage Loan Schedule in computer readable format with respect to such
Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

                  (b)      The Seller shall transfer and deliver to the
Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Trust the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the
other property and rights related thereto described in paragraph (a) of this
Section 2.05 only upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions on
or prior to the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date:

                  (i)      The Seller shall have provided the Issuer, the
         Depositor, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and
         the Rating Agencies with an Addition Notice in


                                       7
<PAGE>


         substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, which notice shall
         be given not less than two Business Days prior to the applicable
         Subsequent Transfer Date and shall designate the Subsequent Mortgage
         Loans to be sold to the Trust and the Aggregate Principal Balance of
         such Mortgage Loans and the Rating Agencies shall have informed the
         Issuer, the Seller, the Depositor, the Note Insurer or the Indenture
         Trustee prior to the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date that the
         inclusion of such Subsequent Mortgage Loans will not result in the
         downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to the Class A Notes
         (without taking the Note Insurance Policy into account);

                  (ii)     The Seller shall have delivered to the Issuer, the
         Indenture Trustee and the Servicer a duly executed Subsequent Transfer
         Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit G;

                  (iii)    The Seller shall have delivered to the Servicer for
         deposit in the Collection Account all principal collected and interest
         collected to the extent accrued and due after the related Due Date in
         the calendar month preceding the month of the Subsequent Transfer Date;

                  (iv)     As of each Subsequent Transfer Date, the Seller was
         not insolvent, the Seller will not be made insolvent by such transfer
         and the Seller is not aware of any pending insolvency;

                  (v)      The Funding Period shall not have terminated;

                  (vi)     The Seller shall have provided the Issuer, the
         Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and the Rating Agencies with an
         Opinion of Counsel relating to the sale (i.e., "True Sale Opinion") of
         the Subsequent Mortgage Loans to the Indenture Trustee and the
         enforceability of the Subsequent Transfer Agreement, which matters may
         be covered in the opinions delivered on the Closing Date;

                  (vii)    The Aggregate Principal Balance of Subsequent
         Mortgage Loans does not exceed the Original Pre-Funded Amount; and

                  (viii)   On the last Subsequent Transfer Date, the Indenture
         Trustee shall have received an accountant's letter confirming that the
         characteristics of the Mortgage Loans (including the Subsequent
         Mortgage Loans) satisfy the parameters set forth in Exhibit H hereto.

                  (c)      The Seller and the Indenture Trustee shall comply
with their respective obligations set forth in Section 2.03 hereof and Section
2.02 of the Servicing Agreement with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans
delivered on each Subsequent Transfer Date. References in such Sections to the
Initial Mortgage Loans or Mortgage Loans shall be deemed to refer to the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans and references to the Cut-Off Date or the Closing
Date, as applicable, shall be deemed to refer to the applicable related Cut-Off
Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, respectively, except that references to 360
days after the Closing Date shall remain unchanged as shall representations made
with specific reference to the Initial Mortgage Loans including such
representations made under Sections 2.02(iii), 2.02(vi), 2.02(xlvii) and
2.02(xlix) of the Servicing Agreement.

                  Except as specifically provided in the immediately preceding
sentence each Subsequent Mortgage Loan complies with each representation and
warranty in Section 2.02(a) of the Servicing Agreement as of the related Cut-Off
Date (or such other date specified).

separate trust account (the "Payment Account") titled Payment Account, "Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee, in trust for the registered
holders of Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust Asset-Backed Notes, Series 2004-2." The
Payment Account shall be an Eligible Account. The Indenture Trustee shall
deposit any amounts received by it from the Collection Account representing
payments on and any collections in respect of the Mortgage Loans in the Payment
Account immediately following receipt thereof, and such amounts shall be
withdrawn from the Payment Account as provided in Section 3.05 herein from
monies on deposit in the Payment Account. Amounts on deposit in the Payment
Account may be invested in Eligible Investments pursuant to Section 3.10.

                  Section 3.02. MAINTENANCE OF OFFICE OR AGENCY. The Issuer will
maintain an office or agency where, subject to satisfaction of conditions set
forth herein, Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange,
and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Notes and
this Indenture may be served. The Issuer hereby initially appoints the Indenture
Trustee to serve as its agent for the foregoing purposes. If at any time the
Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to furnish
the Indenture Trustee with the address thereof, such surrenders may be made at
the office of the Indenture Trustee's agent located at c/o DTC Transfer
Services, 55 Water Street, Jeanette Park Entrance, New York, New York 10041, and
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office.

                  Section 3.03. MONEY FOR PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST; PAYING

respect to any Notes that are to be made from amounts withdrawn from the Payment

Indenture Trustee or by the Paying Agent, and no amounts so withdrawn from the
Payment Account for payments of Notes shall be paid over to the Issuer except as
provided in this Section 3.03. The Issuer hereby appoints the Indenture Trustee
as its Paying Agent.

                  The Issuer shall cause each Paying Agent other than the
Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to the Indenture Trustee an instrument
in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the
Indenture Trustee acts as Paying Agent it hereby so agrees), subject to the
provisions of this Section 3.03, that such Paying Agent shall:

                  (i)      hold all sums held by it for the payment of amounts
         due with respect to the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons
         entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or
         otherwise disposed of as herein provided and pay such sums to such
         Persons as herein provided;


                                       10
<PAGE>


                  (ii)     give the Indenture Trustee notice of any default by
         the Issuer of which a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge in the
         making of any payment required to be made with respect to the Notes;

                  (iii)    at any time during the continuance of any such
         default, upon the written request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith
         pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying
         Agent;

                  (iv)     immediately resign as Paying Agent and forthwith pay
         to the Indenture Trustee all sums held by it in trust for the payment
         of Notes if at any time it ceases to meet the standards required to be
         met by a Paying Agent at the time of its appointment;

                  (v)      comply with all requirements of the Code with respect
         to the withholding from any payments made by it on any Notes of any
         applicable withholding taxes imposed thereon and with respect to any
         applicable reporting requirements in connection therewith; and

                  (vi)     not commence a bankruptcy proceeding against the
         Issuer in connection with this Indenture.

                  The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer
Request direct any Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in
trust by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee upon
the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such Paying Agent; and
upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Indenture Trustee, such Paying
Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.

                  Subject to applicable laws with respect to escheat of funds,
any money held by the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the
payment of any amount due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for
one year after such amount has become due and payable shall be discharged from
such trust and be paid to the Issuer on Issuer Request; and the Holder of such
Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer
for payment thereof (but only to the extent of the amounts so paid to the
Issuer), and all obligations of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, shall at the expense and direction of the Issuer cause to be
published once, in an Authorized Newspaper published in the English language,
notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified
therein which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication,
any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.
The Indenture Trustee may also adopt and employ, at the expense and direction of
the Issuer, any other reasonable means of notification of such repayment
(including, but not limited to, mailing notice of such repayment to Holders
whose Notes have been called but have not been surrendered for redemption or
whose right to or interest in monies due and payable but not claimed is
determinable from the records of the Indenture Trustee or of any Paying Agent,
at the last address of record for each such Holder).

                  Section 3.04. EXISTENCE. The Issuer will keep in full effect
its existence, rights and franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the
State of Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is or
becomes, organized under the laws of any other state or of the United States of
America, in which case the Issuer will keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises under the laws of such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and
preserve its qualification to do business in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes, the Mortgage Loans and each other
instrument or agreement included in the Trust Estate.

                  Section 3.05. PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.

                  (ii)     to the Holders of the Class A Notes an amount equal
         to the Class Principal Payment Amount for such Payment Date;

                  (iii)    to the Note Insurer an amount equal to the sum of (1)
         the accrued and unpaid Premium Amount, (2) an amount sufficient to

         Insurance Agreement, and (3) I and I Payments;

                  (iv)     to the Servicer (1) certain Reimbursable Amounts
         (other than Monthly Advances and Servicing Advances) and (2) the amount
         of Nonrecoverable Advances, not previously reimbursed;

                  (v)      to the Spread Account, the remaining Monthly Excess
         Spread Amount until the Base Spread Account Requirement is reached;

                  (vi)     to the Holders of the Class A Notes, the Available
         Funds Cap Rate Carryover Amount (after giving effect to deposits made

under the Note Insurance Policy for such Payment Date pursuant to Section 3.30.
Funds received by the Indenture Trustee as a result of any claim under the Note
Insurance Policy shall be applied solely to payments to Class A Noteholders and
may not be applied to satisfy costs, expenses or liabilities of the Servicer,
the Indenture Trustee or the Trust.

                  (c)      METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION. The Indenture Trustee shall
make distributions in respect of a Payment Date to each Noteholder of record on
the related Record Date by check or money order mailed to such Noteholder at the

delivered to the Indenture Trustee at least five Business Days prior to such
Record Date, by wire transfer.

                  (d)      DISTRIBUTIONS ON BOOK-ENTRY CERTIFICATES. Each
payment with respect to a Book-Entry Note shall be paid to the Depository, which
shall credit the amount of such payment to the accounts of its Depository
Participants in accordance with its normal procedures. Each Depository
Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such payment to the Note Owners
that it represents and to each indirect participating brokerage firm (a
"brokerage firm" or "indirect participating firm") for which it acts as agent.
Each brokerage firm shall be responsible for disbursing funds to the Note Owners
that it represents. All such credits and disbursements with respect to a
Book-Entry Note are to be made by the Depository and the Depository Participants
in accordance with the provisions of the Notes. None of the Indenture Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Note Registrar, the Depositor, the Servicer or the Seller
shall have any responsibility therefor except as otherwise provided by
applicable law.

                  (e)      CALCULATION OF THE NOTE INTEREST RATE. With respect
to the Class A Notes, on the second LIBOR Business Day immediately preceding
each Payment Date (referred to in this sentence as the "current Payment Date")
the Indenture Trustee shall determine LIBOR and the Note Interest Rate for such
Class and the Payment Date next succeeding such current Payment Date and inform
the Servicer (at the facsimile number given to the Indenture Trustee in writing)
of such rate.

                  (f)      Reserved.

                  (g)      Any installment of interest or principal, if any,
payable on any Note that is punctually paid or duly provided for by the Issuer
on the applicable Payment Date shall, if such Holder shall have so requested at

                  Section 3.10. INVESTMENT OF ACCOUNTS.

                  (a)      So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, and consistent with any requirements of the Code, all or a
portion of any Account held by the Indenture Trustee shall be invested and
reinvested by the Indenture Trustee, as directed in writing by the Servicer or
Seller, in one or more Eligible Investments bearing interest or sold at a
discount. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or if the
Servicer does not provide investment directions, the Trustee shall invest all
Accounts in the following: Fund 541. No such investment in any Account shall
mature later than the Business Day immediately preceding the next Payment Date
(except that (i) if such Eligible Investment is an obligation of the Indenture
Trustee, then such Eligible Investment shall mature not later than such Payment
Date, and (ii) such Eligible Investments may mature on any other date as may be
approved by the Rating Agencies and the Note Insurer).

                  (b)      If any amounts are needed for disbursement from any
Account held by the Indenture Trustee and sufficient uninvested funds are not
available to make such disbursement, the Indenture Trustee at the direction of
the Servicer shall cause to be sold or otherwise converted to cash a sufficient
amount of the investments in such Account. The Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable for any investment loss or other charge resulting therefrom unless the
Indenture Trustee's failure to perform in accordance with this Section 3.10 is
the cause of such loss or charge.

                  (c)      Subject to Section 6.01 hereof, the Indenture Trustee
shall not in any way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in any
Account held by the Indenture Trustee resulting from any investment loss on any
Eligible Investment included therein (except to the


                                       16
<PAGE>


extent that the Indenture Trustee is the obligor and has defaulted thereon or as
provided in subsection (b) of this Section 3.10).

                  (d)      Reserved.

                  (e)      So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, all net income and gain realized from investment of, and all
earnings on funds deposited in, the Collection Account, the Payment Account, the
Pre-Funding Account and the Capitalized Interest Account shall be for the
benefit of the Servicer as servicing compensation (in addition to the Servicing
Fee), and shall be subject to withdrawal on or before the first Business Day of
the month following the month in which such income or gain is received. The
Servicer shall deposit into the Collection Account, the Payment Account, the
Pre-Funding Account, the Capitalized Interest Account or the Spread Account, as
the case may be, the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any Eligible
Investment held therein which is in excess of the income and gain thereon
immediately upon realization of such loss, without any right to reimbursement
therefor from its own funds. Income or gain from Eligible Investments held in
the Spread Account and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, from all other Eligible Investments shall be deposited into the
Spread Account and shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture. Amounts on deposit in the Spread Account may be invested at the
Servicer's direction for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Note Insurer and
shall mature no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the next
Payment Date.

reinvest any cash held in the Accounts in the absence of timely and specific
written investment direction from the Servicer. In no event shall the Trustee be
liable for the selection of investments or for investment losses incurred
thereon. The Indenture Trustee shall have no liability in respect of losses
incurred as a result of the liquidation of any investment prior to its stated
maturity or the failure of the Servicer to provide timely written investment
direction. The Indenture Trustee or its Affiliates are permitted to receive
additional compensation that could be deemed to be in the Indenture Trustee's
economic self-interest for (i) serving as investment adviser, administrator,
shareholder servicing agent, custodian or sub-custodian with respect to certain
of the Eligible Investments, (ii) using Affiliates to effect transactions in
certain Eligible Investments and (iii) effecting transactions in certain
Eligible Investments.

Contract Counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination
event under the Corridor Contract of which a Responsible Officer of the
Indenture Trustee has actual knowledge. In the event that the Corridor Contract
is canceled or otherwise terminated for any reason (other than the exhaustion of
the interest rate protection provided thereby), the Indenture Trustee shall, and
to the extent a replacement contract is available (from a counterparty
acceptable to the Issuer and having a long-term rating of at least "A" by S&P),
execute a replacement contract comparable to such Corridor Contract providing
interest rate protection which is equal to the then-existing protection provided
by the Corridor Contract at the expense of the Seller; provided, however, that
the cost of any such replacement contract providing the same interest rate
protection may be reduced to a level


                                       17

benefit of the representations and warranties made by the Seller in (i) the
Purchase Agreement concerning the Seller and the Initial Mortgage Loans and (ii)
any Subsequent Transfer Agreement concerning the Seller and the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans to the same extent as though such representations and warranties
were made directly to the Indenture Trustee. If a Responsible Officer of the
Indenture Trustee has actual knowledge of any breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Seller in the Purchase Agreement or in the applicable
Subsequent Transfer Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly notify the
Seller of such finding and of the Seller's obligation to cure such defect or
repurchase or substitute for the related Mortgage Loan.

                  Section 3.13. AMENDMENTS TO SERVICING AGREEMENT. The Issuer

thereunder (taking into account not only the general definition of the term
"investment company" but also any available exceptions to such general

                  (i)      This Indenture creates a valid and continuing
         security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Collateral
         in favor of the Indenture Trustee, which security interest is prior to
         all other liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and
         purchasers from the Issuer.

                  (ii)     The Collateral constitutes "deposit accounts" or
         "instruments," as applicable, within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

                  (iii)    The Issuer owns and has good and marketable title to
         the Collateral, free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance of any
         Person.

                  (iv)     The Issuer has taken all steps necessary to cause the
         Indenture Trustee to become the account holder of the Collateral.

                  (v)      Other than the security interest granted to the
         Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture, the Issuer has not
         pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise
         conveyed any of the Collateral.

                  (vi)     The Collateral is not in the name of any Person other
         than the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer has not consented
         to the bank maintaining the Collateral to comply with instructions of
         any Person other than the Indenture Trustee.

                  (b)      With respect to that portion of the Collateral
described in clause (e), the Issuer represents to the Indenture Trustee that:

                  (i)      This Indenture creates a valid and continuing
         security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Collateral
         in favor of the Indenture Trustee, which security interest is prior to
         all other liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and
         purchasers from the Issuer.

                  (ii)     The Collateral constitutes "general intangibles"
         within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

                  (iii)    The Issuer owns and has good and marketable title to
         the Collateral, free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance of any
         Person.

                  (iv)     Other than the security interest granted to the
         Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture, the Issuer has not
         pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise
         conveyed any of the Collateral.

                  (c)      With respect to any Collateral in which a security
interest may be perfected by filing, the Issuer has not authorized the filing
of, and is not aware of any financing statements against, the Issuer, that
include a description of collateral covering such Collateral, other than any
financing statement relating to the security interest granted to the Indenture
Trustee hereunder or that has been terminated. The Issuer is not aware of any
judgment or tax lien filings against the Issuer.


                                       22
<PAGE>


                  (d)      The Issuer has caused or will have caused, within ten
days, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing
office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect
the security interest in all Collateral granted to the Indenture Trustee
hereunder in which a security interest may be perfected by filing and the Issuer
will cause such security interest to be maintained. Any financing statement that
is filed in connection with this Section 3.28 shall contain a statement that a
purchase or security interest in any collateral described therein will violate
the rights of the secured party named in such financing statement.

                  (e)      The foregoing representations may not be waived and
shall survive the issuance of the Notes.

                  Section 3.29. ESTABLISHMENT OF SPREAD ACCOUNT; DEPOSITS IN
SPREAD ACCOUNT; PERMITTED WITHDRAWALS FROM SPREAD ACCOUNT.

                  (a)      No later than the Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee
shall establish and maintain for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Note
Insurer an Eligible Account titled "Spread Account, Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company, as trustee for the registered holders of Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust
Asset-Backed Notes, Series 2004-2." The Spread Account (including any investment
earnings thereon) shall be treated as owned by the Certificateholders. Except as
set forth in clause (c) of this Section 3.29, the Indenture Trustee shall,
promptly upon receipt, deposit into the Spread Account and retain therein:

                  (i)      on each Payment Date, the Monthly Excess Spread
         Amount transferred by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section
         3.05(a)(v); and

                  (ii)     upon receipt, amounts required to be deposited or to
         be paid by the Servicer pursuant to Section 3.10(e) in connection with
         losses and gains on investments of amounts in the Spread Account.

                  (b)      Amounts on deposit in the Spread Account shall be
withdrawn on each Payment Date by the Indenture Trustee in the following order
of priority:

                  (i)      to deposit into the Payment Account an amount equal
         to the excess of (x) the sum of the maximum amount to be paid pursuant
         to Section 3.05(a)(i)-(iii) for such Payment Date, over (y) the
         Available Funds for such Payment Date (other than any amounts with
         respect to Insured Amounts and deposits from the Spread Account);

                  (ii)     to the extent that the amount then on deposit in the
         Spread Account exceeds the aggregate Base Spread Account Requirement as
         of such Payment Date (such excess, a "Spread Account Excess"), an
         amount equal to such Spread Account Excess shall be paid to the
         Servicer and/or the Seller to the extent of any Reimbursable Amounts
         not previously reimbursed and the remainder to the Certificateholders;

and also, in no particular order of priority:

                  (iii)    to invest amounts on deposit in the Spread Account in
         Eligible Investments that are scheduled to mature on or prior to the
         Business Day preceding the


                                       23
<PAGE>


         next Payment Date, as directed in writing by the Servicer in accordance
         with Section 3.10(e);

                  (iv)     to withdraw any amount not required to be deposited
         in the Spread Account or deposited therein in error;

                  (v)      [reserved]; and

                  (vi)     to clear and terminate the Spread Account upon the
         termination of this Indenture and, upon such termination, to pay the
         balance, if any, to the Certificateholders.

                  (c)      On the Payment Date on which all amounts due have
been paid to the Class A Noteholders, including the Note Insurer as subrogee of
the Class A Noteholders, and all I & I Payments have been paid to the Note
Insurer, the Indenture Trustee, after making any required withdrawals from the
Spread Account pursuant to the preceding paragraph, shall:

                  (i)      clear and terminate the Spread Account, liquidate any
         investments therein and pay any uninvested funds therein or the
         proceeds of such liquidation to the Servicer and/or the Seller to the
         extent of any Reimbursable Amounts, and the remainder to the
         Certificateholders; and

                  (ii)     pay future receipts of the Excess Spread to the
         Servicer and/or the Seller to the extent of any Reimbursable Amounts,
         and the remainder to the Certificateholders.

                  (d)      The Spread Account may be terminated and other assets
substituted therefor including mortgage loans similar to the Mortgage Loans, at
any time, with the prior written approval of the Note Insurer and the Rating
Agencies, and with written confirmation that such termination and substitution
will not result in a downgrade of the current ratings of the Class A Notes
without giving effect to the Note Insurance Policy.

                  Section 3.30. NOTE INSURANCE POLICY.

                  (a)      As soon as possible, and in no event later than 12:00
noon New York time on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Payment
Date, the Indenture Trustee shall furnish the Note Insurer and the Servicer with
a completed notice in the form set forth as Exhibit A to the Endorsement to the
Note Insurance Policy (the "Notice") in the event that the Available Funds
(other than any amounts in respect of Insured Amounts) are insufficient to pay
the Remittance Amount with respect to the Class A Noteholders, as applicable, on
such Payment Date. The Notice shall specify the amount of Insured Amounts and
shall constitute a claim for an Insured Amount pursuant to the Note Insurance
Policy. Upon receipt of Insured Amounts on behalf of the Class A Noteholders
under the Note Insurance Policy, the Indenture Trustee shall deposit such
Insured Amounts in the Payment Account and shall pay such Insured Amounts
pursuant to Section 3.05.

                  (b)      The Indenture Trustee shall receive, as
attorney-in-fact of each Holder of a Class A Note, any Insured Amount from the
Note Insurer and disburse the same to each Holder of a Class A Note in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.05. Insured Amounts disbursed by the
Indenture Trustee from proceeds of the Note Insurance Policy shall not be
considered


                                       24
<PAGE>


payment by the Trust nor shall such payments discharge the obligation of the
Trust with respect to the Class A Notes, and the Class A Note Principal Balance
shall be deemed not reduced for such purposes and the Note Insurer shall become
the owner of such unpaid amounts due from the Trust in respect of the Class A
Notes. The Indenture Trustee hereby agrees on behalf of each Holder of a Class A
Note for the benefit of the Note Insurer that it recognizes that to the extent
the Note Insurer pays Insured Amounts, either directly or indirectly (as by
paying through the Indenture Trustee), to the Class A Noteholders, the Note
Insurer will be subrogated to the rights of such Class A Noteholders, with
respect to such Insured Amounts, shall be deemed to the extent of the payments
so made to be a registered Class A Noteholder for purposes of payment and shall
receive all future Remittance Amounts until all such Insured Amounts by the Note
Insurer have been fully reimbursed, subject to the following paragraph. To
evidence such subrogation, the Indenture Trustee shall note the Note Insurer's
rights as subrogee on the registration books maintained by the Indenture Trustee
and on any Class A Notes surrendered for payment upon receipt from the Note
Insurer of proof of payment of any Insured Amount. Except as otherwise described
herein, the Note Insurer shall not acquire any voting rights hereunder as a
result of such subrogation. The effect of the foregoing provisions is that, to
the extent of Insured Amounts paid by it, the Note Insurer shall be paid before
payment of the balance of the Remittance Amount is made to the other Holders of
the Class A Notes subject to the following paragraph.

                  (c)      It is understood and agreed that the intention of the
parties is that the Note Insurer shall not be entitled to reimbursement on any
Payment Date for amounts previously paid by it, unless, on such Payment Date,
the Class A Noteholders shall also have received the full amount of the
Remittance Amount (exclusive of amounts representing amounts previously paid to
the Class A Noteholders as Insured Amounts) for such Payment Date.

                  (d)      The Indenture Trustee shall keep complete and
accurate records of the amount of Insured Amounts and the Note Insurer shall
have the right to inspect such records at reasonable times during the Indenture
Trustee's normal business hours upon one Business Day's prior notice to the
Indenture Trustee.

                  (e)      The Indenture Trustee shall promptly notify the Note
Insurer of any proceeding or the institution of any action seeking the avoidance
as a preferential transfer under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership
or similar law (a "Preference Claim") of any payment made with respect to the
Class A Notes. Each Holder, by its purchase of Class A Notes, and the Indenture
Trustee hereby agree that, the Note Insurer (so long as no Note Insurer Default
exists) may, at any time during the continuation of any proceeding relating to a
Preference Claim, direct all matters relating to such Preference Claim,
including, without limitation, (i) the direction of any appeal of any order
relating to any Preference Claim, and (ii) the posting of any surety,
supersedeus or performance bond pending any such appeal. In addition, and
without limitation of the foregoing, the Note Insurer shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Indenture Trustee and each such Holder in the conduct of any such
Preference Claim, including, without limitation, all rights of any party to an
adversary proceeding action with respect to any order issued in connection with
any such Preference Claim. Insured Amounts paid by the Note Insurer to the
Indenture Trustee shall be received by the Indenture Trustee, as agent of the
Noteholders. The Indenture Trustee is not permitted to make a claim on the Trust
or on any Noteholder for payments made to Noteholders under the Note Insurance
Policy which are characterized as


                                       25

preference payments by any Bankruptcy Court having jurisdiction over any
bankrupt Mortgagor unless ordered to do so by such Bankruptcy Court.

                  (a)      On the Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee shall

the Class A Notes and the Note Insurer, an Eligible Account titled "Pre-Funding
Account, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company in trust for registered Holders of
Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust Asset-Backed Notes, Series 2004-2, Class A." Funds
in the Pre-Funding Account shall be held in trust for the Holders of the Class A
Notes and the Note Insurer for the uses and purposes set forth in this
Indenture. Funds in the Pre-Funding Account shall be held separate and apart
from, and shall not be commingled with, any other moneys, including without
limitation, other moneys held by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
Indenture. Any Pre-Funding Earnings shall be distributed to the Seller on each
Pre-Funding Payment Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the final Subsequent
Transfer Date occurs after the Payment Date in a month, on such Subsequent
Transfer Date, the Indenture Trustee shall (i) transfer the Excess Funding
Amount from the Pre-Funding Account to the Payment Account, (ii) transfer the
Pre-Funding Earnings to the Seller and (iii) close the Pre-Funding Account. The
amount on deposit in the Pre-Funding Account shall be invested in Eligible
Investments at the direction of the Seller in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.10. All investment earnings on funds on deposit in the Pre-Funding
Account shall be treated as owned by, and shall be taxable to, the Seller.

                  (b)      On the Closing Date, the Issuer shall cause to be
deposited the Original Pre-Funded Amount in the Pre-Funding Account from the
sale of the Notes.

                  (c)      On each Subsequent Transfer Date, (i) the Seller
shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to withdraw from the Pre-Funding Account an
amount equal to 100% of the Aggregate Principal Balances of the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans sold to the Trust on such Subsequent Transfer Date and (ii) the
Indenture Trustee shall pay such amounts to the Issuer, or upon the order of the
Issuer, to its designee with respect to such transfer.

                  (d)      If at the end of the Funding Period amounts still
remain in the Pre-Funding Account, the Issuer shall instruct the Indenture
Trustee to withdraw such amounts from the Pre-Funding Account on the immediately
following Payment Date and deposit such amounts in the Payment Account.

                  (e)      Unless sooner closed as provided above, the
Pre-Funding Account shall be closed at the close of business on the Payment Date
immediately following the end of the Funding Period.

                  Section 3.32. ESTABLISHMENT OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST ACCOUNT;
DEPOSITS IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST ACCOUNT AND PERMITTED WITHDRAWALS FROM
CAPITALIZED INTEREST ACCOUNT.

                  (a)      With respect to amounts on deposit in the Pre-Funding
Account, in order to assure that sufficient amounts to make required payments of
interest to the Noteholders shall be available during the Funding Period, on the
Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee shall establish


                                       26
<PAGE>


and maintain in its name, in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Class A
Notes and the Note Insurer, an Eligible Account titled "Capitalized Interest
Account, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company in trust for registered Holders of
Financial Asset Securities Corp., Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust Asset-Backed
Notes, Series 2004-2, Class A." Funds in the Capitalized Interest Account shall
be held in trust for the Holders of the Class A Notes and the Note Insurer for
the uses and purposes set forth in this Indenture. Funds in the Capitalized
Interest Account shall be held separate and apart from, and shall not be
commingled with, any other moneys, including without limitation, other moneys
held by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture. Funds in the
Capitalized Interest Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments at the
direction of the Servicer in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.10. All
investment earnings on funds in the Capitalized Interest Account shall be paid
to the Issuer or its designee on each Pre-Funding Payment Date.

                  (b)      On the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause to be
deposited the Capitalized Interest Deposit in the Capitalized Interest Account.

                  (c)      On each of the Payment Dates during the Funding
Period, the Indenture Trustee shall withdraw from the Capitalized Interest
Account the Capitalized Interest Required Amount for such Payment Date and
deposit such amount into the Payment Account.

                  (d)      If at the end of the Funding Period amounts still
remain in the Capitalized Interest Account, the Issuer hereby instructs the
Indenture Trustee to withdraw such amounts from the Capitalized Interest Account
on the immediately following Payment Date and remit such amounts to the Servicer
or its designee. Upon any such payment to the Servicer or its designee, the
Noteholders shall have no further rights in, or claims to, such amounts.

                  (e)      Unless sooner closed as provided above, the
Capitalized Interest Account shall be closed at the close of business on the

CLASS A NOTEHOLDERS.

                  By accepting its Note, each Class A Noteholder agrees that

otherwise to require) the actions of the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer or the
Noteholders, (e) provide that any action or omission taken with the consent,
approval or authorization of the Note Insurer shall be authorized hereunder or
shall not subject the party taking or omitting to take such action to any
liability hereunder, or (f) which have a similar effect, shall be of no further
force and effect and the Indenture Trustee shall administer the Trust and
perform its obligations hereunder solely for the benefit of the Holders of the
Notes. Nothing in the foregoing sentence, nor any action taken pursuant thereto
or in compliance therewith, shall be deemed to have released the Note Insurer
from any obligation or liability it may have to any party or to the Noteholders
hereunder, under any other agreement, instrument or document (including, without
limitation, the Note Insurance Policy) or under applicable law.

                                   ARTICLE IV

               THE NOTES; SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE

                  Section 4.01. THE NOTES. Each Class of Notes shall be
registered in the name of a nominee designated by the Depository. Beneficial
Owners will hold interests in the Notes through the book-entry facilities of the
Depository in minimum initial Class A Note Principal Balance of $25,000 and
integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof.

                  The Indenture Trustee may for all purposes (including the
making of payments due on the Notes) deal with the Depository as the authorized
representative of the Beneficial Owners with respect to the Notes for the
purposes of exercising the rights of Holders of the Notes hereunder. Except as
provided in the next succeeding paragraph of this Section 4.01, the rights of
Beneficial Owners with respect to the Notes shall be limited to those
established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the
Depository and Depository Participants. Except as provided in Section 4.08
hereof, Beneficial Owners shall not be entitled to definitive notes for the
Notes as to which they are the Beneficial Owners. Requests and directions from,
and votes of, the Depository as Holder of the Notes shall not be deemed
inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Beneficial Owners. The
Indenture Trustee may establish a reasonable record date in connection with
solicitations of consents from or voting by Noteholders and give notice to the
Depository of such record date. Without the consent of the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee, no Note may be transferred by the Depository except to a
successor Depository that agrees to hold such Note for the account of the
Beneficial Owners.

                  In the event the Depository Trust Company resigns or is
removed as Depository, the Indenture Trustee with the approval of the Issuer may
appoint a successor Depository. If no successor Depository has been appointed
within 30 days of the effective date of the Depository's resignation or removal,
each Beneficial Owner shall be entitled to certificates representing the Notes
it beneficially owns in the manner prescribed in Section 4.08.

                  The Notes shall, on original issue, be executed on behalf of
the Issuer by the Owner Trustee, not in its individual capacity but solely as
Owner Trustee, authenticated by the Indenture Trustee and delivered by the
Indenture Trustee to or upon the order of the Issuer.

                  Section 4.02. REGISTRATION OF AND LIMITATIONS ON TRANSFER AND
EXCHANGE OF NOTES; APPOINTMENT OF NOTE REGISTRAR AND CERTIFICATE.

                  The Indenture Trustee shall cause to be kept at the Corporate
Trust Office a Note Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as
it may prescribe, the Note Registrar shall provide for the registration of Notes
and of transfers and exchanges of Notes as herein provided.

                  Subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth below,
upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the Corporate Trust
Office, the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall execute and the Note
Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the


                                       30
<PAGE>


designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes in authorized
initial Class A Note Principal Balance evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interests.

                  Subject to the foregoing, at the option of the Noteholders,
Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and in authorized initial
Class A Note Principal Balance evidencing the same Class and aggregate
Percentage Interests upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Note Registrar. Whenever any Notes are so
surrendered for exchange, the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall
execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Notes which
the Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Each Note presented
or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by
the Note Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Note Registrar
duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing
with such signature guaranteed by a commercial bank or trust company located or
having a correspondent located in the city of New York. Notes delivered upon any
such transfer or exchange will evidence the same obligations, and will be
entitled to the same rights and privileges, as the Notes surrendered.

                  No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Note Registrar shall require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes.

                  The Issuer hereby appoints the Indenture Trustee as (i)
Certificate Registrar to keep at its Corporate Trust Office a Certificate
Register pursuant to Section 3.09 of the Trust Agreement in which, subject to
such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Certificate Registrar shall
provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges
thereof pursuant to Section 3.05 of the Trust Agreement and (ii) Note Registrar
under this Indenture. The Indenture Trustee hereby accepts such appointments.

                  Section 4.03. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN NOTES. If
(i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture
Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft
of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee such security
or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note
Registrar or the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser, and provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC
are met, the Issuer shall execute, and upon its request the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note; provided,
however, that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated
Note, shall have become or within seven days shall be due and payable, instead
of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen
Note when so due or payable without surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of
such replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to
the proviso to the preceding sentence, a bona fide purchaser of the original
Note in lieu of which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment such
original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover
such replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to whom it was delivered
or any Person taking such replacement Note from such Person to whom such
replacement Note was delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a bona


                                       31
<PAGE>


fide purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity
provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in connection therewith.

                  Upon the issuance of any replacement Note under this Section
4.03, the Issuer may require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and
expenses of the Indenture Trustee) connected therewith.

                  Every replacement Note issued pursuant to this Section 4.03 in
replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an
original additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by
anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

                  The provisions of this Section 4.03 are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

                  Section 4.04. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. Prior to due presentment
for registration of transfer of any Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Paying Agent and any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name any Note is registered (as of the day of determination) as
the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and
interest, if any, on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or
not such Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Paying Agent nor any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

                  Section 4.05. CANCELLATION. All Notes surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer, exchange or redemption shall, if surrendered to any
Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be delivered to the Indenture Trustee
and shall be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer may at any
time deliver to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the
Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for
any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section 4.05, except as expressly
permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of by
the Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention or disposal
policy as in effect at the time unless the Issuer shall direct by an Issuer
Request that they be destroyed or returned to it; provided, however, that such
Issuer Request is timely and the Notes have not been previously disposed of by
the Indenture Trustee.

                  Section 4.06. BOOK-ENTRY NOTES. The Notes, upon original
issuance, will be issued in the form of typewritten Notes representing the
Book-Entry Notes, to be delivered to The Depository Trust Company, the initial
Depository, by, or on behalf of, the Issuer. The Notes shall initially be
registered on the Note Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the
initial Depository, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a Definitive Note
representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Note, except as provided
in Section 4.08. With respect to


                                       32
<PAGE>


such Notes, unless and until definitive, fully registered Notes (the "Definitive
Notes") have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 4.08:

                  (i)      the provisions of this Section 4.06 shall be in full
         force and effect;

                  (ii)     the Note Registrar, the Paying Agent and the
         Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Depository for all
         purposes of this Indenture (including the payment of principal of and
         interest on the Notes and the giving of instructions or directions
         hereunder) as the sole Holder of the Notes, and shall have no
         obligation to the Beneficial Owners of the Notes;

                  (iii)    to the extent that the provisions of this Section
         4.06 conflict with any other provisions of this Indenture, the
         provisions of this Section 4.06 shall control;

                  (iv)     the rights of Beneficial Owners shall be exercised
         only through the Depository and shall be limited to those established
         by law and agreements between such Owners of Notes and the Depository
         and/or the Depository Participants. Unless and until Definitive Notes
         are issued pursuant to Section 4.08, the initial Depository will make
         book-entry transfers among the Depository Participants and receive and
         transmit payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to such
         Depository Participants; and

                  (v)      whenever this Indenture requires or permits actions
         to be taken based upon instructions or directions of Holders of Notes
         evidencing a specified percentage of the Class A Note Principal Balance
         of the Notes, the Depository shall be deemed to represent such
         percentage with respect to the Notes only to the extent that it has
         received instructions to such effect from Beneficial Owners and/or
         Depository Participants owning or representing, respectively, such
         required percentage of the beneficial interest in the Notes and has
         delivered such instructions to the Indenture Trustee.

                  Section 4.07. NOTICES TO DEPOSITORY. Whenever a notice or
other communication to the Note Holders is required under this Indenture, unless
and until Definitive Notes shall have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant
to Section 4.08, the Indenture Trustee shall give all such notices and
communications specified herein to be given to Holders of the Notes to the
Depository, and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners.

                  Section 4.08. DEFINITIVE NOTES. If (i) the Indenture Trustee
determines that the Depository is no longer willing or able to properly
discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Notes and the Indenture
Trustee or the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) after
the occurrence of an Event of Default, Beneficial Owners of Notes representing
beneficial interests aggregating at least a majority of the Class A Note
Principal Balance of the Class A Notes advise the Depository in writing that the
continuation of a book-entry system through the Depository is no longer in the
best interests of the Beneficial Owners, then the Depository shall notify all
Beneficial Owners, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee of the occurrence of any
such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to Beneficial Owners
requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Indenture Trustee of the typewritten
Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes by the Depository, accompanied by
registration instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate the Definitive Notes in


                                       33
<PAGE>


accordance with the instructions of the Depository. None of the Issuer, the Note
Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of
such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in
relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, the
Indenture Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes as
Noteholders.

                  Section 4.09. TAX TREATMENT. The Issuer has entered into this
Indenture, and the Notes will be issued with the intention that, for federal,
state and local income, single business and franchise tax purposes, the Notes
will qualify as indebtedness. The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee (in
accordance with Section 6.06 hereof), by entering into this Indenture, and each
Noteholder, by its acceptance of its Note (and each Beneficial Owner by its
acceptance of an interest in the applicable Book-Entry Note), agree to treat the
Notes for federal, state and local income, single business and franchise tax
purposes as indebtedness.

                  Section 4.10. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE. This
Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the Notes except
as to (i) rights of Noteholders to receive payments of principal thereof and
interest thereon, (ii) Sections 3.03, 3.04, 3.06, 3.09, 3.17, 3.19 and 3.20,
(iii) the rights and immunities of the Indenture Trustee hereunder (including
the rights of the Indenture Trustee under Section 6.07) and the obligations of
the Indenture Trustee under Section 4.11 and (iv) the rights of Noteholders as
beneficiaries hereof with respect to the property so deposited with the
Indenture Trustee payable to all or any of them, and the Indenture Trustee, on
demand of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments
acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the
Notes and shall release and deliver the Collateral to or upon the order of the
Issuer, when

                  (A)      either

                  (1)      all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered
         (other than (i) Notes that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and that
         have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 4.03 hereof and (ii)
         Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust
         or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to
         the Issuer or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 3.03)
         have been delivered to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation; or

                  (2)      all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Indenture
         Trustee for cancellation (a) have become due and payable, (b) will
         become due and payable at the Latest Possible Maturity Date within one
         year, or (c) have been called for early redemption pursuant to Section
         8.07 hereof, and the Issuer, in the case of (a) or (b) above, has
         irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the
         Indenture Trustee cash or direct obligations of or obligations
         guaranteed by the United States of America (which will mature prior to
         the date such amounts are payable), in trust for such purpose, in an
         amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such
         Notes then outstanding not theretofore delivered to the Indenture
         Trustee for cancellation when due on the Latest Possible Maturity Date
         or other final Payment Date, or, in the case of (c) above, the Issuer
         shall have complied with all requirements of Section 8.07 hereof,


                                       34
<PAGE>


                  (B)      the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other
         sums payable hereunder; and

                  (C)      the Issuer has delivered to the Indenture Trustee an
         Officer's Certificate stating that the Purchase Price has been
         deposited in the Collection Account and an Opinion of Counsel stating
         that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the
         satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with
         and, if the Opinion of Counsel relates to a deposit made in connection
         with Section 4.10(A)(2)(b) above, such opinion shall further be to the
         effect that such deposit will constitute an "in-substance defeasance"
         within the meaning of Revenue Ruling 85-42, 1985-1 C.B. 36, and in
         accordance therewith, the Issuer will be the owner of the assets
         deposited in trust for federal income tax purposes.

                  Section 4.11. APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY. All monies deposited
with the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof shall be held in
trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent,
Certificate Paying Agent as designee of the Issuer, to the Holders of Notes or
Certificates, of all sums due and to become due thereon for principal and
interest or otherwise; but such monies need not be segregated from other funds
except to the extent required herein or required by law.

                  Section 4.12. RESERVED.

                  Section 4.13. REPAYMENT OF MONIES HELD BY PAYING AGENT. In
connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to
the Notes, all monies then held by any Person other than the Indenture Trustee
under the provisions of this Indenture with respect to such Notes shall, upon
demand of the Issuer, be paid to the Indenture Trustee to be held and applied
according to Section 3.05 and thereupon such Person shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such monies.

                  Section 4.14. TEMPORARY NOTES. Pending the preparation of any
Definitive Notes, the Issuer may execute and upon its written direction, the
Indenture Trustee may authenticate and make available for delivery, temporary
Notes that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, photocopied or otherwise
produced, in any denomination, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive
Notes in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions,
omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such
Notes may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

                  If temporary Notes are issued, the Issuer will cause
Definitive Notes to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of the Definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable
for Definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at the office of the
Indenture Trustee located at c/o DTC Transfer Services, 55 Water Street,
Jeanette Park Entrance, New York, New York 10041, without charge to the Holder.
Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Issuer
shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and make available
for delivery, in exchange therefor, Definitive Notes of authorized denominations
and of like tenor, class and aggregate


                                       35
<PAGE>


principal amount. Until so exchanged, such temporary Notes shall in all respects
be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Notes.

                  Section 4.15. REPRESENTATION REGARDING ERISA. By acquiring a
Note or interest therein, each Holder of such Note or Beneficial Owner of any
such interest will be deemed to represent that either (1) it is not acquiring
the Note with Plan Assets or (2) (A) the acquisition, holding and transfer of
such Note will not give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and (B) the Notes are rated
investment grade or better and such person believes that the Notes are properly
treated as indebtedness without substantial equity features for purposes of the
Department of Labor regulation 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101, and agrees to so treat
the Notes. Alternatively, regardless of the rating of the Notes, such person may
provide the Indenture Trustee with an opinion of counsel, which opinion of
counsel will not be at the expense of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Seller, any Underwriter, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer
or any successor servicer which opines that the acquisition, holding and
transfer of such Note or interest therein is permissible under applicable law,
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code and will not subject the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Seller, the Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer or any successor servicer to any obligation in addition to those
undertaken in the Indenture.

                              DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

                  Section 5.01. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The Issuer shall deliver to
the Indenture Trustee and the Note Insurer, written notice in the form of an
Officer's Certificate, within five days after learning of the occurrence of any
event which with the giving of notice and the lapse of time would become an
Event of Default under clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of the definition of "Event of
Default," its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take
with respect thereto. The Indenture Trustee shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer has actual
knowledge thereof or unless written notice of such Event of Default is received
by a Responsible Officer and such notice references the Notes, the Trust Estate
or this Indenture.

                  Section 5.02. ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND
ANNULMENT. If an Event of Default should occur and be continuing, then and in
every such case the Indenture Trustee shall at the written direction of the Note
Insurer, or may at the written direction of the Holders of Notes representing
not less than a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes,
declare the Notes to be immediately due and payable, by a notice in writing to
the Issuer (and to the Indenture Trustee if such notice is given by the Note
Insurer or the Noteholders), and upon any such declaration the unpaid Class A
Note Principal Balance, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon
through the date of acceleration shall become immediately due and payable.

                  At any time after such declaration of acceleration of maturity
with respect to an Event of Default has been made and before a judgment or
decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee
as hereinafter in this Article V provided, the Note Insurer or the Holders of
the Notes representing not less than a majority of the Class A Note Principal
Balance of the Notes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
may waive the related Event of Default and rescind and annul such declaration
and its consequences if:

                  (i)      the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Indenture
         Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (a) all payments of principal of and
         interest on the Notes and all other amounts that would then be due
         hereunder or upon the Notes if the Event of Default giving rise to such
         acceleration had not occurred; and (b) all sums paid or advanced by the
         Indenture Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
         disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and
         counsel; and

                  (ii)     all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of
         the principal of the Notes that has become due solely by such
         acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.12.

                  No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or
impair any right consequent thereto.

                  Section 5.03. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR
ENFORCEMENT BY INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

                  (a)      The Issuer covenants that if (i) default is made in
the payment of any interest on any Note when the same becomes due and payable,
and such default continues for a period of five days, or (ii) default is made in
the payment of the principal of or any installment of the principal of any Note
when the same becomes due and payable, the Issuer shall, upon demand of the
Indenture Trustee, at the direction of the Note Insurer or the Holders of a
majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes, pay to the
Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, the whole amount
then due and payable on the Notes for principal and interest, with interest at
the applicable Note Rate upon the overdue principal, and in addition thereto
such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and counsel.

                  (b)      In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such
amounts upon such demand, the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee
of an express trust, subject to the provisions of Section 10.16 hereof may
institute a Proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes and collect in the manner
provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor the Notes,
wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.

                  (c)      If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
Indenture Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 10.16 hereof may, as
more particularly provided in Section 5.04 hereof, in its discretion, proceed to
protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Noteholders, by such
appropriate Proceedings, as directed in writing by the Note Insurer or by
Holders of a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes, to
protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any
covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable
right vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or by law.

                  (d)      In case there shall be pending, relative to the
Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes or any Person having or claiming an
ownership interest in the Trust Estate, Proceedings under Title 11 of the United
States Code or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or
reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been
appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other
obligor or Person, or in case of any other comparable judicial Proceedings
relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or
property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Indenture Trustee, as directed
in writing by the Note Insurer or by Holders of a majority of the Class A Note
Principal Balance of the Notes, irrespective of whether the principal of any
Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Indenture Trustee shall have made any
demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such Proceedings or otherwise:

                  (i)      to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole
         amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the
         Notes and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or
         advisable in order to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee
         (including any claim for reasonable compensation of the Indenture
         Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, and their respective
         agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses
         and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Indenture
         Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result of
         its negligence or bad faith) and of the Noteholders allowed in such
         Proceedings;

                  (ii)     unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations,
         to vote on behalf of the Holders of Notes in any election of a trustee,
         a standby trustee or Person performing similar functions in any such
         Proceedings;

                  (iii)    to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to pay all amounts
         received with respect to the claims of the Noteholders and of the
         Indenture Trustee on their behalf, and

                  (iv)     to file such proofs of claim and other papers or
         documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims
         of the Indenture Trustee or the Holders of Notes allowed in any
         judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer, its creditors and its
         property; and any trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other
         similar official in any such Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of
         such Noteholders to make payments to the Indenture Trustee.

                  (e)      Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
the Indenture Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt
on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to
authorize the Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any
Noteholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election
of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar Person.

                  (f)      All rights of action and of asserting claims under
this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Indenture
Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in
any trial or other Proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or
proceedings instituted by the Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own name
as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the
payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Indenture
Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and their respective agents and
attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes, subject
to Section 5.05 hereof.

                  (g)      In any Proceedings brought by the Indenture Trustee
(and also any Proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this
Indenture to which the Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture
Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Notes, and it shall
not be necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such Proceedings.

                  Section 5.04. REMEDIES; PRIORITIES.

                  (a)      If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and if an acceleration has been declared and not rescinded pursuant
to Section 5.02 hereof, the Indenture Trustee subject to the provisions of
Section 10.16 hereof may, and shall, at the written direction of the Note
Insurer or the Holders of a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of
the Notes, do one or more of the following (subject to Section 5.05 hereof):

                  (i)      institute Proceedings in its own name and as trustee
         of an express trust for the collection of all amounts then payable on
         the Notes or under this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by
         declaration or otherwise enforce any judgment obtained, and collect
         from the Issuer and any other obligor upon such Notes monies adjudged
         due;

                  (ii)     institute Proceedings from time to time for the
         complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the
         Trust Estate;

                  (iii)    exercise any remedies of a secured party under the
         UCC and take any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the
         rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and the
         Holders of the Notes; and

                  (iv)     sell the Trust Estate or any portion thereof or
         rights or interest therein, at one or more public or private sales
         called and conducted in any manner permitted by law; provided, however,
         that the Indenture Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the
         Trust Estate following an Event of Default, unless (A) the Indenture
         Trustee obtains the consent of the Note Insurer and the Holders of 100%
         of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes, (B) the proceeds of
         such sale or liquidation payable to the Holders of the Notes are
         sufficient to discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon
         such Notes for principal and interest or (C) the Indenture Trustee
         determines that the Mortgage Loans will not continue to provide
         sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the
         applicable Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not
         been declared due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee obtains the
         consent of the Note Insurer and the Holders of a majority of the Class
         A Note Principal Balance of the Notes. In determining such sufficiency
         or insufficiency with respect to clause (B) and (C), the Indenture
         Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon written advice or an
         opinion (obtained at the expense of the Trust) of an Independent
         investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
         feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the
         Trust Estate for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long
         as an Event of Default under the Servicing Agreement has not occurred,
         any sale of the Trust Estate shall be made subject to the continued
         servicing of the Mortgage Loans by the Servicer as provided in the
         Servicing Agreement.

                  (b)      If the Indenture Trustee collects any money or
property pursuant to this Article V, it shall pay out the money or property in
the following order:

                  (i)      (A) to the Indenture Trustee for amounts due pursuant
         to Section 6.07 hereof and any expenses incurred in connection with and
         related to collection of the Notes and enforecement of remedies
         including, without limitation, expenses incurred in


                                       40
<PAGE>


         connection with a servicer transfer and (B) to the Owner Trustee for
         amounts due pursuant to Article VII of the Trust Agreement;

                  (ii)     to the Noteholders the Interest Payment Amount due
         and payable;

                  (iii)    to the Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the
         Class A Notes with respect to principal, according to the amounts due
         and payable on such Notes for principal, until the Class A Note
         Principal Balance is reduced to zero;

                  (iv)     to the Note Insurer any unpaid premium for the Note
         Insurance Policy and any other amounts owed to the Note Insurer under
         the Insurance Agreement; and

                  (v)      to the payment of the remainder, if any to the
         Certificate Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer or to any other person
         legally entitled thereto.

                  The Indenture Trustee may fix a record date and Payment Date
for any payment to Noteholders pursuant to this Section 5.04. At least 15 days
before such record date, the Indenture Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder a
notice that states the record date, the Payment Date and the amount to be paid.

                  Section 5.05. OPTIONAL PRESERVATION OF THE TRUST ESTATE. If
the Notes have been declared to be due and payable under Section 5.02 following
an Event of Default and such declaration and its consequences have not been
rescinded and annulled, the Indenture Trustee may elect to take and maintain
possession of the Trust Estate. It is the desire of the parties hereto and the
Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient funds for the payment of
principal of and interest on the Notes and other obligations of the Issuer and
the Indenture Trustee shall take such desire into account when determining
whether or not to take and maintain possession of the Trust Estate. In
determining whether and how to take and maintain possession of the Trust Estate,
the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon the written advice
or an opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of
national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the
sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such purpose.

                  Section 5.06. LIMITATION OF SUITS. No Holder of any Note shall
have any right to institute any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect
to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any
other remedy hereunder, unless and subject to the provisions of Section 10.16
hereof

                  (i)      such Holder has previously given written notice to
         the Indenture Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

                  (ii)     the Holders of not less than 25% of the Class A Note
         Principal Balance of the Notes have made a written request to the
         Indenture Trustee to institute such Proceeding in respect of such Event
         of Default in its own name as Indenture Trustee hereunder;

                  (iii)    such Holder or Holders have offered to the Indenture
         Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs,
         expenses and liabilities to be incurred in complying with such request;


                                       41
<PAGE>


                  (iv)     the Indenture Trustee for 60 days after its receipt
         of such notice of request and offer of indemnity has failed to
         institute such Proceedings; and

                  (v)      no direction inconsistent with such written request
         has been given to the Indenture Trustee during such 60-day period by
         the Holders of a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the
         Notes.

                  It is understood and intended that no one or more Holders of
Notes shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing
of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights
of any other Holders of Notes or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or
preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture,
except in the manner herein provided.

                  Section 5.07. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHTS OF NOTEHOLDERS TO RECEIVE
PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.

                  Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Indenture, the
Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to
receive payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on such Note on or
after the respective due dates thereof expressed in such Note or in this
Indenture and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and
such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

                  Section 5.08. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If the
Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any
right or remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been discontinued
or abandoned for any reason or has been determined adversely to the Indenture
Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in
such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former
positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been
instituted.

                  Section 5.09. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No right or
remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee, the Note
Insurer or to the Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or
employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

                  Section 5.10. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT A WAIVER. No delay or
omission of the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer or any Holder of any Note to
exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article V or by law
to the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer or to the Noteholders may be
exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the
Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer or by the Noteholders, as the case may be.


                                       42
<PAGE>


                  Section 5.11. CONTROL BY NOTEHOLDERS. The Note Insurer or the
Holders of a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes shall
have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding
for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee; provided that:

                  (i)      such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule
         of law or with this Indenture;

                  (ii)     any direction to the Indenture Trustee to sell or
         liquidate the Trust Estate shall be by Holders of Notes representing
         not less than 100% of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes;

                  (iii)    the Indenture Trustee has been provided with
         indemnity satisfactory to it; and

                  (iv)     the Indenture Trustee may take any other action
         deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee that is not inconsistent with
         such direction of the Note Insurer or the Holders of Notes representing
         a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes.

                  Notwithstanding the rights of Noteholders set forth in this
Section 5.11 the Indenture Trustee need not take any action that it determines
might involve it in liability.

                  Section 5.12. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. Prior to the
declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes as provided in
Section 5.02 hereof, the Note Insurer or the Holders of Notes representing not
less than a majority of the Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes may
waive any past Event of Default and its consequences except an Event of Default
(a) with respect to payment of principal of or interest on any of the Notes or
(b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of the Holder of each Note. In the case of any such
waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Event of Default or impair
any right consequent thereto.

                  Upon any such waiver, any Event of Default arising therefrom
shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose
of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

                  Section 5.13. UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS. All parties to this
Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note and each Beneficial Owner of any
interest therein by such Holder's or Beneficial Owner's acceptance thereof shall
be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any
suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any
suit against the Indenture Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by
it as Indenture Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its
discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits


                                       43
<PAGE>


and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the
provisions of this Section 5.13 shall not apply to (a) any suit instituted by
the Indenture Trustee, (b) any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of
Noteholders, in each case holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the Class A
Note Principal Balance of the Notes or (c) any suit instituted by any Noteholder
for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or interest on any Note on or
after the respective due dates expressed in such Note and in this Indenture.

                  Section 5.14. WAIVER OF STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS. The Issuer
covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any
time insist upon, or plead or in any manner whatsoever, claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at
any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of
this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby
expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it
shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to
the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such
power as though no such law had been enacted.

                  Section 5.15. SALE OF TRUST ESTATE.

                  (a)      The power to effect any sale or other disposition (a
"Sale") of any portion of the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof is
expressly subject to the provisions of Section 5.05 hereof and this Section
5.15. The power to effect any such Sale shall not be exhausted by any one or
more Sales as to any portion of the Trust Estate remaining unsold, but shall
continue unimpaired until the entire Trust Estate shall have been sold or all
amounts payable on the Notes and under this Indenture shall have been paid. The
Indenture Trustee may from time to time postpone any public Sale by public
announcement made at the time and place of such Sale. The Indenture Trustee
hereby expressly waives its right to any amount fixed by law as compensation for
any Sale.

                  (b)      The Indenture Trustee shall not in any private Sale
sell the Trust Estate, or any portion thereof, unless

                  (i)      the Note Insurer and the Holders of all Notes consent
         to or direct the Indenture Trustee to make, such Sale, or

                  (ii)     the proceeds of such Sale would be not less than the
         entire amount which would be payable to the Noteholders under the
         Notes, in full payment thereof in accordance with Section 5.02 hereof,
         on the Payment Date next succeeding the date of such Sale, or

                  (iii)    the Indenture Trustee determines that the conditions
         for retention of the Trust Estate set forth in Section 5.05 hereof
         cannot be satisfied (in making any determination under this Section
         5.15, the Indenture Trustee may rely upon written advice or an opinion
         of an Independent investment banking firm obtained and delivered as
         provided in Section 5.05 hereof), and the Note Insurer and the Holders
         of Notes representing at least 100% of the Class A Note Principal
         Balance of the Notes consent to such Sale.

<PAGE>


                  The purchase by the Indenture Trustee of all or any portion of
the Trust Estate at a private Sale shall not be deemed a Sale or other
disposition thereof for purposes of this Section 5.15(b).

                  (c)      [Reserved].

                  (d)      In connection with a Sale of all or any portion of
the Trust Estate,

                  (i)      any Holder or Holders of Notes may bid for and
         purchase the property offered for sale, and upon compliance with the
         terms of sale may hold, retain and possess and dispose of such
         property, without further accountability, and may, in paying the
         purchase money therefor, deliver any Notes or claims for interest
         thereon in lieu of cash up to the amount which shall, upon distribution
         of the net proceeds of such sale, be payable thereon, and such Notes,
         in case the amounts so payable thereon shall be less than the amount
         due thereon, shall be returned to the Holders thereof after being
         appropriately stamped to show such partial payment;

                  (ii)     the Indenture Trustee, may bid for and acquire the
         property offered for Sale in connection with any Sale thereof, and,
         subject to any requirements of, and to the extent permitted by,
         applicable law in connection therewith, may purchase all or any portion
         of the Trust Estate in a private sale, and, in lieu of paying cash
         therefor, may make settlement for the purchase price by crediting the
         gross Sale price against the sum of (A) the amount which would be
         payable to the Holders of the Notes and Holders of the Certificates on
         the Payment Date next succeeding the date of such Sale and (B) the
         expenses of the Sale and of any Proceedings in connection therewith
         which are reimbursable to it, without being required to produce the
         Notes in order to complete any such Sale or in order for the net Sale
         price to be credited against such Notes, and any property so acquired
         by the Indenture Trustee shall be held and dealt with by it in
         accordance with the provisions of this Indenture;

                  (iii)    the Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver an
         appropriate instrument of conveyance, prepared by the Issuer and
         satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, transferring its interest in any

                  (iv)     the Indenture Trustee is hereby irrevocably appointed
         the agent and attorney-in-fact of the Issuer to transfer and convey its
         interest in any portion of the Trust Estate in connection with a Sale
         thereof, and to take all action necessary to effect such Sale; and

                  (v)      no purchaser or transferee at such a Sale shall be
         bound to ascertain the Indenture Trustee's authority, inquire into the
         satisfaction of any conditions precedent or see to the application of
         any monies.

                  Section 5.16. ACTION ON NOTES. The Indenture Trustee's right
to seek and recover judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be
affected by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other relief under or

rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders shall


                                       45

be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture Trustee against the
Issuer or by the levy of any execution under such judgment upon any portion of
the Trust Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer. Any money or property

                  (a)      Promptly following a request from the Indenture

                              THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

                  Section 6.01. DUTIES OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

                  (a)      If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in
it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise
as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct
of such person's own affairs.

                  (b)      Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

                  (i)      the Indenture Trustee undertakes to perform such
         duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
         Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into
         this Indenture against the Indenture Trustee; and

                  (ii)     in the absence of bad faith on its part, the
         Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
         statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon
         certificates or opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and
         conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; however, the
         Indenture Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to
         determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
         Indenture.

                  (c)      The Indenture Trustee may not be relieved from
liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, its
own willful misconduct or its own gross negligence, except that:

                  (i)      this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph
         (b) of this Section 6.01;

                  (ii)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any
         error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer unless it
         is proved that the Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the
         pertinent facts; and

                  (iii)    the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable with
         respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in
         accordance with a direction received by it from Noteholders, the
         Servicer or from the Issuer, which they are entitled to give under the
         Basic Documents.

                  (d)      The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for
interest on any money received by it.

                  (e)      Money held in trust by the Indenture Trustee need not
be segregated from other trust funds except to the extent required by law or the
terms of this Indenture or the Trust Agreement.

<PAGE>


                  (f)      No provision of this Indenture shall require the
Indenture Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise
of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe
that repayment of such funds or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk
or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

                  (g)      Every provision of this Indenture relating to the
conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Indenture
Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the provisions
of the TIA.

                  (h)      The Indenture Trustee shall act in accordance with
Section 6.02 and 6.04 of the Servicing Agreement and shall act as successor to
the Servicer or appoint a successor Servicer in accordance with Section 6.02 of
the Servicing Agreement.

                  (i)      In order to comply with its duties under U.S.A.
Patriot Act, the Indenture Trustee shall obtain and verify certain information
and documentation from the other parties hereto, including, but not limited to,
such party's name, address, and other indentifying information.

                  Section 6.02. RIGHTS OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

                  (a)      The Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely on, and
shall be fully protected from acting or refraining from acting upon, any
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
the proper person. The Indenture Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter
stated in the document.

                  (b)      Before the Indenture Trustee acts or refrains from
acting, it may require an Officer's Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The
Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take
in good faith in reliance on an Officer's Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

                  (c)      The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any
action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be
authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Indenture
Trustee's conduct does not constitute willful misconduct, negligence or bad
faith.

                  (d)      The Indenture Trustee may consult with counsel, and
the advice or Opinion of Counsel with respect to legal matters relating to the
Basic Documents and the Notes shall be full and complete authorization and
protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by
it hereunder or in connection herewith in good faith and in accordance with the
advice or opinion of such counsel.

                  (e)      The Indenture Trustee may execute any of the trusts
or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder, either directly or by or
through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed with due care, and
shall not be responsible for any willful misconduct or negligence on the part of
any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed.

<PAGE>


                  (f)      The Indenture Trustee or its Affiliates are permitted
to receive additional compensation that could be deemed to be in the Indenture
Trustee's economic self-interest for (i) serving as investment adviser,
administrator, shareholder, servicing agent, custodian or sub-custodian with
respect to certain of the Eligible Investments, (ii) using Affiliates to effect
transactions in certain Eligible Investments and (iii) effecting transactions in
certain Eligible Investments. Such compensation shall not be considered an
amount that is reimbursable or payable to the Indenture Trustee (i) as part of
the Indenture Trustee Fee, (ii) pursuant to Sections 5.04(b), 6.07 or 8.02(c)
hereunder or (iii) out of the Remittance Amount.

                  (g)      The Indenture Trustee in its capacity as Paying Agent
and Note Registrar shall be afforded the same rights, protections, immunities
and indemnities offered to it in its capacity as Indenture Trustee as if
specifically set forth herein.

                  Section 6.03. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE. The
Indenture Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates
with the same rights it would have if it were not Indenture Trustee, subject to
the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act. Any Note Registrar, co-registrar or
co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Indenture Trustee
must comply with Sections 6.11 and 6.12 hereof.

                  Section 6.04. INDENTURE TRUSTEE'S DISCLAIMER. The Indenture
Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the
validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable
for the Issuer's use of the proceeds from the Notes, and it shall not be
responsible for any statement of the Issuer in the Indenture or in any document
issued in connection with the sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the
Indenture Trustee's certificate of authentication.

                  Section 6.05. NOTICE OF EVENT OF DEFAULT. Subject to Section
5.01, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly mail to each Noteholder notice of the
Event of Default after it is actually known by a Responsible Officer of the
Indenture Trustee, unless such Event of Default shall have been waived or cured.

                  Section 6.06. REPORTS BY INDENTURE TRUSTEE TO HOLDERS AND TAX
ADMINISTRATION.

                  The Indenture Trustee shall deliver to each Noteholder such
information as may be required to enable such holder to prepare its federal and
state income tax returns. The Indenture Trustee shall prepare and file (or cause
to be prepared and filed), on behalf of the Owner Trustee or the Issuer, all tax
returns (if any) and information reports, tax elections and such annual or other
reports of the Issuer as are necessary for preparation of tax returns and
information reports as provided in Section 5.03 of the Trust Agreement,
including without limitation, Form 1099. All tax returns and information reports
shall be signed by the Owner Trustee as provided in Section 5.03 of the Trust
Agreement.

                  Section 6.07. COMPENSATION. The Indenture Trustee shall
withdraw from the Collection Account on each Payment Date and pay to itself the
Indenture Trustee Fee. The Indenture Trustee's compensation shall not be limited
by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.


                                       49
<PAGE>


                  The Issuer's payment obligations to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall survive the discharge of this Indenture and
the termination or resignation of the Indenture Trustee. When the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of an Event of
Default with respect to the Issuer, the expenses are intended to constitute
expenses of administration under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other
applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

                  Section 6.08. REPLACEMENT OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE. No resignation
or removal of the Indenture Trustee and no appointment of a successor Indenture
Trustee shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.08. The Indenture Trustee
may resign at any time by so notifying the Issuer and the Note Insurer. The Note
Insurer or Holders of a majority of Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes
may remove the Indenture Trustee by so notifying the Indenture Trustee and may
appoint a successor Indenture Trustee. The Issuer shall remove the Indenture
Trustee if:

                  (i)      the Indenture Trustee fails to comply with Section
         6.11 hereof;

                  (ii)     the Indenture Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or
         insolvent;

                  (iii)    a receiver or other public officer takes charge of
         the Indenture Trustee or its property; or

                  (iv)     the Indenture Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of
         acting.

                  If the Indenture Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy
exists in the office of the Indenture Trustee for any reason (the Indenture
Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Indenture
Trustee), the Issuer shall, with the consent of the Note Insurer, promptly
appoint a successor Indenture Trustee.

                  A successor Indenture Trustee shall deliver a written
acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Indenture Trustee and to the
Issuer. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Indenture Trustee
shall become effective, and the successor Indenture Trustee shall have all the
rights, powers and duties of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture. The
successor Indenture Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to
Noteholders. The retiring Indenture Trustee shall promptly transfer all property
held by it as Indenture Trustee to the successor Indenture Trustee.

                  If a successor Indenture Trustee does not take office within
30 days after the retiring Indenture Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring
Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the Note Insurer or the Holders of a majority of
Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee.

                  Notwithstanding the replacement of the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to this Section, the Issuer's obligations under Section 6.07 shall
continue for the benefit of the retiring Indenture Trustee.

                  Section 6.09. SUCCESSOR INDENTURE TRUSTEE BY MERGER. If the
Indenture Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all
or substantially all of its corporate


                                       50
<PAGE>


trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the
resulting, surviving or transferee corporation, without any further act, shall
be the successor Indenture Trustee; provided, that such corporation or banking
association shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under Section 6.11 hereof.
The Indenture Trustee shall provide the Rating Agencies and the Note Insurer
with prior written notice of any such transaction.

                  If at the time such successor or successors by merger,
conversion or consolidation to the Indenture Trustee shall succeed to the trusts
created by this Indenture and any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but
not delivered, any such successor to the Indenture Trustee may adopt the
certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee and deliver such Notes
so authenticated; and if at that time any of the Notes shall not have been
authenticated, any successor to the Indenture Trustee may authenticate such
Notes either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the
successor to the Indenture Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates
shall have the full force which it is in the Notes or in this Indenture provided
that the certificate of the Indenture Trustee shall have.

                  Section 6.10. APPOINTMENT OF CO-INDENTURE TRUSTEE OR SEPARATE
INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Indenture, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirement of any
jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may at the time be located,
the Indenture Trustee shall have the power and may execute and deliver all
instruments to appoint one or more Persons to act as a co-trustee or
co-trustees, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the
Trust Estate, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for
the benefit of the Noteholders, such title to the Trust Estate, or any part
hereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section, such powers,
duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Indenture Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be
required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section
6.11 hereof.

                  (b)      Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following
provisions and conditions:

                  (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
         imposed upon the Indenture Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon
         and exercised or performed by the Indenture Trustee and such separate
         trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate
         trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the
         Indenture Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under
         any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to
         be performed the Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified
         to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties
         and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Estate or
         any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
         performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at
         the direction of the Indenture Trustee;

                  (ii)     no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by
         reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and


                                       51
<PAGE>


                  (iii)    the Indenture Trustee may at any time accept the
         resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

                  (c)      Any notice, request or other writing given to the
Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then
separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them.
Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to
this Indenture and the conditions of this Article VI. Each separate trustee and
co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with
the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either
jointly with the Indenture Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein,
subject to all the provisions of this Indenture, specifically including every
provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability
of, or affording protection to, the Indenture Trustee. Every such instrument
shall be filed with the Indenture Trustee.

                  (d)      Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time
constitute the Indenture Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power
and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under
or in respect of this Indenture on its behalf and in its name. If any separate
trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest
in and be exercised by the Indenture Trustee, to the extent permitted by law,
without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.

                  Section 6.11. ELIGIBILITY; DISQUALIFICATION. The Indenture
Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA ss. 310(a). The
Indenture Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition
and it or its parent shall have a long-term debt rating of "Baa3" or better by
Moody's and "BBB" or better by S&P, and Fitch. The Indenture Trustee shall
comply with TIA ss. 310(b), including the optional provision permitted by the
second sentence of TIA ss. 310(b)(9); provided, however, that there shall be
excluded from the operation of TIA ss. 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures
under which other securities of the Issuer are outstanding if the requirements
for such exclusion set forth in TIA ss. 310(b)(1) are met.

                  Section 6.12. PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST
ISSUER. The Indenture Trustee shall comply with TIA ss. 311(a), excluding any
creditor relationship listed in TIA ss. 311(b). An Indenture Trustee who has
resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA ss. 311(a) to the extent
indicated.

                  Section 6.13. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Indenture
Trustee hereby represents and warrants to the Issuer and for the benefit of the
Note Insurer and the Noteholders, as of the Cut-off Date and the Closing Date,

                  (i)      It is a national banking association duly organized,
         validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United
         States.

         it, will not violate its charter or bylaws.

         consummate all transactions contemplated by this Indenture has duly

         and has duly executed and delivered this Indenture.

                  (iv)     This Indenture, assuming due authorization, execution
         and delivery by the Issuer, constitutes a valid, legal and binding
         obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance with the terms
         hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership,
         reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally, and (B) general principles of equity,
         regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
         equity or at law.

                  Section 6.14. DIRECTIONS TO INDENTURE TRUSTEE. The Indenture
Trustee is hereby directed:

                  (i)      to accept the pledge of the Mortgage Loans and hold

the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Payment Date is not applicable,
payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the Class A Notes at
the office or agency of the Indenture Trustee therein specified.

                  (c)      Upon presentation and surrender of the Class A Notes,
the Indenture Trustee shall cause to be paid to the Holders of Class A Notes, as
applicable, on the Payment Date for such final payment, in proportion to the
Percentage Interests of their respective Class A Notes and to the extent that
funds are available for such purpose, an amount equal to the amount required to
be paid to Class A Noteholders pursuant to Section 5.01 for such Payment Date.
On the final Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee shall withdraw from the Payment
Account and remit to the Note Insurer the lesser of (x) the amount available for
payment on such final Payment Date, net of any portion thereof necessary to pay
Class A Noteholders pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(i) and (ii) and (y) the unpaid
amounts due and owing to the Note Insurer pursuant to Section 5.01(a).

                  (d)      In the event that all of the Class A Noteholders
shall not surrender their Class A Notes for final payment and cancellation on or
before such final Payment Date, the


                                       62

Indenture Trustee shall promptly following such date cause all funds in the
Payment Account not paid in final payment to Class A Noteholders to be withdrawn
therefrom and credited to the remaining Class A Noteholders by depositing such
funds in a separate escrow account for the benefit of such Class A Noteholders
and the Servicer (if the Servicer has exercised its right to purchase the
Mortgage Loans) or the Indenture Trustee (in any other case) shall give a second
written notice to the remaining Class A Noteholders to surrender their Class A
Notes for cancellation and receive the final payment with respect thereto. If
within one year after the second notice all the Class A Notes shall not have
been surrendered for cancellation, the Indenture Trustee shall return such funds
in the escrow account to the Issuer.

                             SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

                  Section 9.01. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITHOUT CONSENT OF
NOTEHOLDERS.

                  (a)      Without the consent of the Holders of any Notes but
with the prior written consent of the Note Insurer (which will not be
unreasonably withheld) and prior notice to the Rating Agencies and the Note
Insurer, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, when authorized by an Issuer
Request, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more
indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the TIA
as in force at the date of the execution thereof), in form satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee, for any of the following purposes:

                  (i)      to correct or amplify the description of any property
         at any time subject to the lien of this Indenture, or better to assure,
         convey and confirm unto the Indenture Trustee any property subject or
         required to be subjected to the lien of this Indenture, or to subject
         to the lien of this Indenture additional property;

                  (ii)     to evidence the succession, in compliance with the
         applicable provisions hereof, of another person to the Issuer, and the
         assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Issuer herein
         and in the Notes contained;

                  (iii)    to add to the covenants of the Issuer, for the
         benefit of the Holders of the Notes, or to surrender any right or power
         herein conferred upon the Issuer;

                  (iv)     to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any
         property to or with the Indenture Trustee;

                  (v)      to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any
         provision herein or in any supplemental indenture that may be
         inconsistent with any other provision herein or in any supplemental
         indenture;

                  (vi)     to make any other provisions with respect to matters
         or questions arising under this Indenture or in any supplemental
         indenture; provided, that such action (as evidenced by either (i) an
         Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee
         or (ii) confirmation from the Rating Agencies that such amendment will
         not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the rating of the Notes
         (without giving effect to the Note Insurance Policy) shall not
         materially and adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the
         Notes;

                  (vii)    to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the
         appointment hereunder by a successor trustee with respect to the Notes
         and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as
         shall be necessary to facilitate the administration of the trusts
         hereunder by more than one trustee, pursuant to the requirements of
         Article VI hereof; or


                                       64
<PAGE>


                  (viii)   to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of this
         Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to effect the
         qualification of this Indenture under the TIA or under any similar
         federal statute hereafter enacted and to add to this Indenture such
         other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA;

provided, however, that no such indenture supplements shall be entered into
unless the Indenture Trustee shall have received an Opinion of Counsel as to the
enforceability of any such indenture supplement and to the effect that (i) such
indenture supplement is permitted hereunder and (ii) entering into such
indenture supplement will not result in a "substantial modification" of the
Notes under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1001-3 or adversely affect the status
of the Notes as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes.

                  The Indenture Trustee is hereby authorized to join in the
execution of any such supplemental indenture and to make any further appropriate
agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained.

                  (b)      The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, when authorized
by an Issuer Request, may, also without the consent of any of the Holders of the
Notes but with the prior written consent of the Note Insurer (which shall not be
unreasonable withheld) and prior notice to the Rating Agencies and the Note
Insurer, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating
any of the provisions of, this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the
rights of the Holders of the Notes under this Indenture; provided, however, that
such action as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, (i) is permitted by this
Indenture, and shall not (ii) adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Noteholder (which may be evidenced by confirmation from the
Rating Agencies that such amendment will not result in the reduction or
withdrawal of the rating of the Notes without giving effect to the Note
Insurance Policy) or (iii) if 100% of the Certificates are not owned by the
Seller, cause the Issuer to be subject to an entity level tax for federal income
tax purposes.

                  Section 9.02. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF
NOTEHOLDERS. The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, when authorized by an Issuer
Request, also may, with prior notice to the Rating Agencies and, with the prior
written consent of the Note Insurer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the Class A
Note Principal Balance of the Notes affected thereby, by Act (as defined in
Section 10.03 hereof) of such Holders delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating
any of the provisions of, this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the
rights of the Holders of the Notes under this Indenture; provided, however, that
no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each
Note affected thereby:

                  (i)      change the date of payment of any installment of
         principal of or interest on any Note, or reduce the principal amount
         thereof or the interest rate thereon, change the provisions of this
         Indenture relating to the application of collections on, or the
         proceeds of the sale of, the Trust Estate to payment of principal of or
         interest on the Notes, or change any place of payment where, or the
         coin or currency in which, any Note or the


                                       65
<PAGE>


         interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for
         the enforcement of the provisions of this Indenture requiring the
         application of funds available therefor, as provided in Article V, to
         the payment of any such amount due on the Notes on or after the
         respective due dates thereof;

                  (ii)     reduce the percentage of the Class A Note Principal
         Balance of the Notes, the consent of the Holders of which is required
         for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the Holders of
         which is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions
         of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences
         provided for in this Indenture;

                  (iii)    modify or alter the provisions of the proviso to the
         definition of the term "Outstanding" or modify or alter the exception
         in the definition of the term "Holder";

                  (iv)     reduce the percentage of the Class A Note Principal
         Balance of the Notes required to direct the Indenture Trustee to direct
         the Issuer to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate pursuant to Section
         5.04 hereof;

                  (v)      modify any provision of this Section 9.02 except to
         increase any percentage specified herein or to provide that certain
         additional provisions of this Indenture or the Basic Documents cannot
         be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Note
         affected thereby;

                  (vi)     modify any of the provisions of this Indenture in
         such manner as to affect the calculation of the amount of any payment
         of interest or principal due on any Note on any Payment Date (including
         the calculation of any of the individual components of such
         calculation); or

                  (vii)    permit the creation of any lien ranking prior to or
         on a parity with the lien of this Indenture with respect to any part of
         the Trust Estate or, except as otherwise permitted or contemplated
         herein, terminate the lien of this Indenture on any property at any
         time subject hereto or deprive the Holder of any Note of the security
         provided by the lien of this Indenture;

and provided, further, that such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel, cause the Issuer (if 100% of the Certificates are not owned by the
Seller) to be subject to an entity level tax.

                  Any such action shall not (as evidenced by either (i) an
Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee or (ii)
confirmation from the Rating Agencies that such amendment will not result in the
reduction or withdrawal of the rating of the Notes (without giving effect to the
Note Insurance Policy) adversely affect in any material respect the interest of
any Holder (other than a Holder who shall consent to such supplemental
indenture).

                  It shall not be necessary for any Act of Noteholders under
this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental
indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance
thereof.

<PAGE>


                  Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 9.02, the
Indenture Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes to which such amendment
or supplemental indenture relates a notice setting forth in general terms the
substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Indenture Trustee
to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way
impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

                  Section 9.03. EXECUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. In
executing, or permitting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental
indenture permitted by this Article IX or the modification thereby of the trusts
created by this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive,
and subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02 hereof, shall be fully protected in
relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such
supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The
Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such
supplemental indenture that affects the Indenture Trustee's own rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

                  Section 9.04. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE. Upon the
execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this
Indenture shall be and shall be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance
therewith with respect to the Notes affected thereby, and the respective rights,
limitations of rights, obligations, duties, liabilities and immunities under
this Indenture of the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Notes
shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all
respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions
of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the
terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

                  Section 9.05. CONFORMITY WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. Every
amendment of this Indenture and every supplemental indenture executed pursuant
to this Article IX shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act
as then in effect so long as this Indenture shall then be qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act.

                  Section 9.06. REFERENCE IN NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES.
Notes authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental
indenture pursuant to this Article IX may, and if required by the Indenture
Trustee shall, bear a notation in form approved by the Indenture Trustee as to
any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee shall so determine, new Notes so modified as to conform, in
the opinion of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, to any such supplemental
indenture may be prepared and executed by the Issuer and authenticated and
delivered by the Indenture Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Notes.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  Section 10.01. COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES AND OPINIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      Upon any application or request by the Issuer to the
Indenture Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Indenture, the
Issuer shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee (i) an Officer's Certificate
stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture
relating to the proposed action have been complied with and (ii) an Opinion of
Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions
precedent, if any, have been complied with, except that, in the case of any such
application or request as to which the furnishing of such documents is
specifically required by any provision of this Indenture, no additional
certificate or opinion need be furnished.

                  Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a
condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include:

                  (i)      a statement that each signatory of such certificate
         or opinion has read or has caused to be read such covenant or condition
         and the definitions herein relating thereto;

                  (ii)     a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the
         examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions
         contained in such certificate or opinion are based;

                  (iii)    a statement that, in the opinion of each such
         signatory, such signatory has made such examination or investigation as
         is necessary to enable such signatory to express an informed opinion as
         to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with;

                  (iv)     a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each
         such signatory, such condition or covenant has been complied with; and

                  (v)      if the signatory of such certificate or opinion is
         required to be Independent, the statement required by the definition of
         the term "Independent Certificate."

                  (b)      (i) Prior to the deposit of any Collateral or other
property or securities with the Indenture Trustee that is to be made the basis
for the release of any property or securities subject to the lien of this
Indenture, the Issuer shall, in addition to any obligation imposed in Section
10.01(a) or elsewhere in this Indenture, furnish to the Indenture Trustee an
Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the opinion of each person signing
such certificate as to the fair value (within 90 days prior to such deposit) to
the Issuer of the Collateral or other property or securities to be so deposited
and a report from a nationally recognized accounting firm verifying such value.


                                       68
<PAGE>


                  (ii)     Whenever the Issuer is required to furnish to the
         Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the
         opinion of any signer thereof as to the matters described in clause (i)
         above, the Issuer shall also deliver to the Indenture Trustee an
         Independent Certificate from a nationally recognized accounting firm as
         to the same matters, if the fair value of the securities to be so
         deposited and of all other such securities made the basis of any such
         withdrawal or release since the commencement of the then current fiscal
         year of the Issuer, as set forth in the certificates delivered pursuant
         to clause (i) above and this clause (ii), is 10% or more of the Class A
         Note Principal Balance of the Notes, but such a certificate need not be
         furnished with respect to any securities so deposited, if the fair
         value thereof as set forth in the related Officer's Certificate is less
         than $25,000 or less than one percent of the Class A Note Principal
         Balance of the Notes.

                  (iii)    Whenever any property or securities are to be
         released from the lien of this Indenture, the Issuer shall also furnish
         to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating
         the opinion of each person signing such certificate as to the fair
         value (within 90 days prior to such release) of the property or
         securities proposed to be released and stating that in the opinion of
         such person the proposed release will not impair the security under
         this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof.

                  (iv)     Whenever the Issuer is required to furnish to the
         Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the
         opinion of any signer thereof as to the matters described in clause
         (iii) above, the Issuer shall also furnish to the Indenture Trustee an
         Independent Certificate as to the same matters if the fair value of the
         property or securities and of all other property or securities released
         from the lien of this Indenture since the commencement of the
         then-current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates required
         by clause (iii) above and this clause (iv), equals 10% or more of the
         Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes, but such certificate need
         not be furnished in the case of any release of property or securities
         if the fair value thereof as set forth in the related Officer's
         Certificate is less than $25,000 or less than one percent of the then
         Class A Note Principal Balance of the Notes.

                  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
nothing contained in this Section 10.01 shall apply to the obligations of the
Indenture Trustee, the Seller or the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement.

                  Section 10.02. FORM OF DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TO INDENTURE
TRUSTEE. In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or
covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all
such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one
or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify
or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

                  Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the
Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate
or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in
the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the


                                       69
<PAGE>


certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which
his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate of an
Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to
factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an
officer or officers of the Seller or the Issuer, stating that the information
with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Seller or the
Issuer, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should
know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such
matters are erroneous.

                  Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or
more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or
other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated
and form one instrument.

                  Whenever in this Indenture, in connection with any application
or certificate or report to the Indenture Trustee, it is provided that the
Issuer shall deliver any document as a condition of the granting of such
application, or as evidence of the Issuer's compliance with any term hereof, it
is intended that the truth and accuracy, at the time of the granting of such
application or at the effective date of such certificate or report (as the case
may be), of the facts and opinions stated in such document shall in such case be
conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to have such application granted
or to the sufficiency of such certificate or report. The foregoing shall not,
however, be construed to affect the Indenture Trustee's right to rely upon the
truth and accuracy of any statement or opinion contained in any such document as
provided in Article VI.

                  Section 10.03. ACTS OF NOTEHOLDERS.

                  (a)      Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given
or taken by Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Noteholders in person
or by agents duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly
provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments
are delivered to the Indenture Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly
required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied
therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of
the Noteholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of
any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.01
hereof) conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in
the manner provided in this Section 10.03 hereof.

                  (b)      The fact and date of the execution by any person of
any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner that the Indenture
Trustee deems sufficient.

                  (c)      The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note
Registrar.

                  (d)      Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Notes shall bind
the Holder of every Note issued upon the registration thereof or in exchange
therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done,


                                       70
<PAGE>


omitted or suffered to be done by the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer in
reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Note.

                  Section 10.04. NOTICES ETC., TO INDENTURE TRUSTEE ISSUER AND
RATING AGENCIES.

                  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or Act of Noteholders or other documents provided or permitted
by this Indenture shall be in writing and if such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or act of Noteholders is to be
made upon, given or furnished to or filed with:

                  (ii)     the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or by any

                  Section 10.05. NOTICES TO NOTEHOLDERS; WAIVER. Where this
Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any event, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing
and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid to each Noteholder affected by such
event, at such Person's address as it appears on the Note Register, not later
than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the
giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Noteholders is given by mail,
neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed
to any particular Noteholder shall affect the


                                       71
<PAGE>


sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Noteholders, and any notice
that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall conclusively be presumed to
have been duly given regardless of whether such notice is in fact actually
received.

                  Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such
notice may be waived in writing by any Person entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of
such notice. Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Indenture
Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of
any action taken in reliance upon such a waiver.

                  In case, by reason of the suspension of regular mail service
as a result of a strike, work stoppage or similar activity, it shall be
impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such notice is
required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any
manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee
shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

                  Where this Indenture provides for notice to the Rating
Agencies, failure to give such notice shall not affect any other rights or
obligations created hereunder, and shall not under any circumstance constitute
an Event of Default.

                  Section 10.06. CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. If any
provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof
that is required to be included in this Indenture by any of the provisions of
the TIA, such required provision shall control.

                  The provisions of TIA ss.ss. 310 through 317 that impose
duties on any Person (including the provisions automatically deemed included
herein unless expressly excluded by this Indenture) are a part of and govern
this Indenture, whether or not physically contained herein.

                  Section 10.07. EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The Article and Section
headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction
hereof.

                  Section 10.08. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and
agreements in this Indenture and the Notes by the Issuer shall bind its
successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. All agreements of the
Indenture Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors, co-trustees and
agents.

                  Section 10.09. SEPARABILITY. In case any provision in this
Indenture or in the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  Section 10.10. BENEFITS OF INDENTURE. The Note Insurer and its
successors and assigns shall be a third-party beneficiary to the provisions of
this Indenture. To the extent that this Indenture confers upon or gives or
grants to the Note Insurer any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Indenture, the Note Insurer may enforce any such right, remedy or claim
conferred, given or granted hereunder. Nothing in this Indenture or in the
Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties
hereto and their successors hereunder,


                                       72
<PAGE>


and the Noteholders and the Note Insurer, any benefit or any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

                  Section 10.11. LEGAL HOLIDAYS. In any case where the date on
which any payment is due shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any
other provision of the Notes or this Indenture) payment need not be made on such
date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force
and effect as if made on the date on which nominally due, and no interest shall
accrue for the period from and after any such nominal date.

                  Section 10.12. GOVERNING LAW. THIS INDENTURE SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
LAWS.

                  Section 10.13. COUNTERPARTS. This Indenture may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the
same instrument.

                  Section 10.14. RECORDING OF INDENTURE. If this Indenture is
subject to recording in any appropriate public recording offices, such recording
is to be effected by the Issuer and at its expense accompanied by an Opinion of
Counsel at its expense (which may be counsel to the Indenture Trustee or any
other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indenture Trustee) to the effect that
such recording is necessary either for the protection of the Noteholders or the
Note Insurer or any other Person secured hereunder or for the enforcement of any
right or remedy granted to the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture.

                  Section 10.15. ISSUER OBLIGATION. No recourse may be taken,
directly or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes or under this Indenture or any
certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith,
against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or (iii) any
partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director, employee or agent of the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of
a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee
or of any successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed (it
being understood that the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee have no such
obligations in their individual capacity) and except that any such partner,
owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent provided by applicable
law, for any unpaid consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or
failure to pay any installment or call owing to such entity. For all purposes of
this Indenture, in the performance of any duties or obligations of the Issuer
hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be subject to, and entitled to the benefits
of, the terms and provisions of Article VI, VII and VIII of the Trust Agreement.

                  Section 10.16. NO PETITION. The Indenture Trustee, by entering
into this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by accepting a Note, hereby covenant
and agree that they will not at any time prior to one year from the date of
termination hereof, institute against the


                                       73
<PAGE>


Depositor or the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Depositor or the
Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States federal or
state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to
the Notes, this Indenture or any of the Basic Documents, except for filing
proofs of claim.

                  Section 10.17. INSPECTION. The Issuer agrees that, at its
expense, on reasonable prior notice, it shall permit any representative of the
Indenture Trustee, during the Issuer's normal business hours, to examine all the
books of account, records, reports and other papers of the Issuer, to make
copies and extracts therefrom, to cause such books to be audited by Independent
certified public accountants, and to discuss the Issuer's affairs, finances and
accounts with the Issuer's officers, employees, and Independent certified public
accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as may be reasonably
requested. The Indenture Trustee shall cause its representatives to hold in
confidence all such information except to the extent disclosure may be required
by law (and all reasonable applications for confidential treatment are
unavailing) and except to the extent that the Indenture Trustee may reasonably
determine that such disclosure is consistent with its obligations hereunder.

                  Section 10.18. NO RECOURSE TO OWNER TRUSTEE. It is expressly
understood and agreed by the parties hereto that (a) this Indenture is executed
and delivered by Wilmington Trust Company, not individually or personally, but
solely as Owner Trustee of Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2, in the exercise
of the powers and authority conferred and vested in it, (b) each of the
representations, undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of the
Issuer is made and intended not as personal representations, undertakings and
agreements by Wilmington Trust Company but is made and intended for the purpose
for binding only the Issuer, (c) nothing herein contained shall be construed as
creating any liability of Wilmington Trust Company, individually or personally,
to perform any covenant either expressed or implied contained herein, all such
liability, if any, being expressly waived by the parties hereto and by any
Person claiming by, through or under the parties hereto and (d) under no
circumstances shall Wilmington Trust Company be personally liable for the
payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Issuer or be liable for the
breach or failure of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant made
or undertaken by the Issuer under this Indenture or any other related documents.

                  Section 10.19. PROOFS OF CLAIM. The Indenture Trustee is
authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the
Noteholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer (or any
other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be
entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such
judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make such
payments to the Indenture Trustee, as administrative expenses associated with
any such proceeding, and, in the event that the Indenture Trustee shall consent
to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholder to pay to the
Indenture Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and
counsel, and any other amounts due to the Indenture Trustee under Section 6.07


                                       74
<PAGE>


hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and counsel, and
any other amounts due the Indenture Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof out of the
estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the
same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all
distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the
Noteholders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation
or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Noteholder
of the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the Indenture Trustee
to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding.

         Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2 (the "Issuer"), a Delaware
statutory trust, for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or
registered assigns, the principal sum of ($_________________) in monthly
installments on the fifteenth day of each month or, if such day is not a

commencing in January 2005 and ending on or before the Payment Date occurring on
the Latest Possible Maturity Date and to pay interest on the Note Balance of
this Note (this "Note") outstanding from time to time as provided below.

         This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of the Issuer's
Asset-Backed Notes, Series 2004-2 (the "Notes"), issued under an Indenture dated
as of December 16, 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and Deutsche Bank
National Trust Company, as indenture trustee (the "Indenture Trustee", which
term includes any successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a
statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are to
be authenticated and delivered. All terms used in this Note which are defined in
the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

         Payments of principal and interest on this Note will be made on each
Payment Date to the Noteholder of record as of the related Record Date. The
"Note Balance" of a Note as of any date of determination is equal to the initial
Note Balance thereof, reduced by the aggregate of all amounts previously paid
with respect to such Note on account of principal and the aggregate amount of
cumulative Loan Losses allocated to such Note on all prior Payment Dates.

         The principal of, and interest on, this Note are due and payable as
described in the Indenture, in such coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debts. All payments made by the Issuer with respect to this Note shall
be equal to this Note's pro rata share of the aggregate payments on all Class A
Notes as described above, and shall be applied as between interest and principal
as provided in the Indenture.

<PAGE>


         All principal and interest accrued on the Notes, if not previously
paid, will become finally due and payable at the Latest Possible Maturity Date.

         The Notes are subject to redemption in whole, but not in part, by the
Servicer on any Payment Date on or after the Payment Date on which the aggregate
Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the end of the prior Due
Period is less than or equal to 10% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of
the Mortgage Loans as of Cut-off Date.

         The Issuer shall not be liable upon the indebtedness evidenced by the
Notes except to the extent of amounts available from the Trust Estate which
constitutes security for the payment of the Notes. The assets included in the
Trust Estate will be the sole source of payments on the Class A Notes, and each
Holder hereof, by its acceptance of this Note, agrees that (i) such Note will be
limited in right of payment to amounts available from the Trust Estate as
provided in the Indenture and (ii) such Holder shall have no recourse to the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Seller, the Servicer or
any of their respective affiliates, or to the assets of any of the foregoing
entities, except the assets of the Issuer pledged to secure the Class A Notes
pursuant to the Indenture and the rights conveyed to the Issuer under the
Indenture.

         Any payment of principal or interest payable on this Note which is
punctually paid on the applicable Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in
whose name such Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date
for such Payment Date by check mailed to such person's address as it appears in
the Note Register on such Record Date, except for the final installment of
principal and interest payable with respect to such Note, which shall be payable
as provided below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon written request with
appropriate instructions by the Holder of this Note delivered to the Indenture
Trustee at least five Business Days prior to the Record Date, any payment of
principal or interest, other than the final installment of principal or
interest, shall be made by wire transfer to an account in the United States
designated by such Holder. All scheduled reductions in the Note Balance of a
Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) effected by payments of principal made
on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all Holders of this Note and of any
note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or
in lieu thereof, whether or not such payment is noted on such Note. The final
payment of this Note shall be payable upon presentation and surrender thereof on
or after the Payment Date thereof at the office or agency of the Issuer
maintained by it for such purpose pursuant to Section 3.02 of the Indenture.

         Subject to the foregoing provisions, each Note delivered under the
Indenture, upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any
other Note shall carry the right to unpaid principal and interest that were
carried by such other Note.

         If an Event of Default as defined in the Indenture shall occur and be
continuing with respect to the Notes, the Notes may become or be declared due
and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If any
such acceleration of maturity occurs prior to the payment of the entire unpaid
Note Balance of the Notes, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note will be
equal to the sum of the unpaid Note Balance of the Notes, together with accrued
and unpaid interest thereon as described in the Indenture. The Indenture
provides that, notwithstanding the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes,
under certain circumstances specified therein, all amounts collected as proceeds
of the Trust Estate securing the Notes or


                                     A-1-3
<PAGE>


otherwise shall continue to be applied to payments of principal of and interest
on the Notes as if they had not been declared due and payable.

         The failure to pay any Class Interest Carryover Shortfall at any time
when funds are not available to make such payment as provided in the Indenture
shall not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

         The Holder of this Note or Beneficial Owner of any interest herein is
deemed to represent that either (1) it is not acquiring this Note with Plan
Assets or (2) (A) the acquisition, holding and transfer of this Note will not
give rise to a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code and (B) this Note is rated investment grade or better
and such person believes that this Note is properly treated as indebtedness
without substantial equity features for purposes of the DOL Regulations, and
agrees to so treat this Note. Alternatively, regardless of the rating of this
Note, such person may provide the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee with
an opinion of counsel, which opinion of counsel will not be at the expense of
the Issuer, the Seller, any Underwriter, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, the Servicer or any successor servicer which opines that the
acquisition, holding and transfer of this Note or interest herein is permissible
under applicable law, will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and will not subject the
Issuer, the Seller, the Depositor, any Underwriter, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee, the Servicer or any successor servicer to any obligation in
addition to those undertaken in the Indenture.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note Register of
the Issuer. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of, or presentation of a
written instrument of transfer for, this Note at the office or agency designated
by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, accompanied by proper instruments of
assignment in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, one or more new Notes
of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate initial Note Balance,
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

         Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note,
the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner
of such Note (i) on the applicable Record Date for the purpose of making
payments and interest of such Note and (ii) on any other date for all other
purposes whatsoever, as the owner hereof, whether or not this Note be overdue,
and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor any such agent of the Issuer
or the Indenture Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

         The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any
time by the Issuer and the Holders of a majority of all Notes at the time
outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting (i) the Note
Insurer or (ii) if the Note Insurer defaults, the Holders of Notes representing
specified percentages of the aggregate Note Balance of the Notes on behalf of
the Holders of all the Notes, to waive any past Default under the Indenture and
its consequences. Any such waiver by the Holder, at the time of the giving
thereof, of this Note (or any one or more predecessor Notes)


                                     A-1-4
<PAGE>


shall bind the Holder of every Note issued upon the registration of transfer
hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon such Note. The Indenture also permits the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms and conditions set
forth in the Indenture without the consent of the Holders of the Notes issued
thereunder.

         Initially, this Note will be registered in the name of Cede & Co. as
nominee of DTC, acting in its capacity as the Depository for this Note. This
Note will be delivered by the clearing agency in denominations as provided in
the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth. This Note is
exchangeable for a like aggregate initial Note Balance of Notes of different
authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering same.

         Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by
the Indenture Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to
any benefit under the Indenture, or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

         AS PROVIDED IN THE INDENTURE, THIS NOTE AND THE INDENTURE CREATING THIS
NOTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED THEREIN.

                  Section 2.02 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER
REGARDING THE MORTGAGE LOANS.

                  (a)      The Seller represents and warrants to the Note
Insurer and to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders as follows as
of the Cut-Off Date (or such other date specified) with respect to the Initial
Mortgage Loans:

                  (i)      The information with respect to each Mortgage Loan
         set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule is true and correct in all
         material respects as of the Cut-Off Date;

                  (ii)     All of the Related Documents have been delivered or
         will be delivered to the Indenture Trustee as required by the Purchase
         Agreement;

                  (iii)    Each Mortgaged Property is improved by a one- to
         five-family Residential Dwelling, which, to the best of the Seller's
         knowledge, does not include cooperatives or (other than with respect to
         4 Initial Mortgage Loans representing 0.40% of the Cut-Off Date Pool
         Principal Balance for which the related Mortgaged Property is attached
         to real estate) manufactured homes and does not constitute anything
         other than real property under state law;

                  (iv)     Each Mortgage Loan is being serviced by the Servicer;

                  (v)      Each Mortgage Loan has an original term to maturity
         from the date on which the first Monthly Payment is due of not more
         than 30 years;

                  (vi)     90.06% of the Initial Mortgage Loans by Cut-Off Date
         Pool Principal Balance have Mortgage Notes that provide for Monthly
         Payments that will adjust semi-annually (other than during the first
         two or three years following origination) with changes to the related
         Loan Rate, which, if timely paid, are sufficient to fully amortize the
         principal balance of such Mortgage Note on or before its maturity date
         and to pay interest at the applicable Loan Rate from time to time in
         effect;

                  (vii)    Each Mortgage is a valid and subsisting first or
         second lien of record on the Mortgaged Property subject, in the case of
         any second Mortgage Loan, only to a First Lien on such Mortgaged
         Property and subject in all cases to the exceptions to title set forth
         in the title insurance policy with respect to the related Mortgage
         Loan, which exceptions are generally acceptable to second mortgage
         lending companies, and such other exceptions to which similar
         properties are commonly subject and which do not individually, or in
         the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the benefits of the
         security intended to be provided by such Mortgage. Any security
         agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to the
         Mortgage and delivered to the Indenture Trustee establishes in the
         Seller a valid and subsisting lien on the property described therein,
         and the Seller has full right to assign the same to the Indenture
         Trustee;

         mortgages, claims, participation interests, equities, pledges or
         security interests of any nature, encumbrances or rights of others
         (collectively, a "Lien"); the Seller has full right and authority under
         all governmental and regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over the
         Seller, subject to no interest or participation of, or agreement with,
         any party, to sell and assign the same pursuant to this Agreement; and

         usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of any Mortgage Note

         Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable in whole or in part, or
         subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense,
         including the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission,
         set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect
         thereto;

         particular jurisdiction, by a title insurance company authorized to
         transact business in the state in which the related Mortgaged Property
         is situated, together with a condominium endorsement, if applicable, in
         an amount at least equal to the original principal balance of such

         this Agreement;

                  (xvii)   Each Mortgage and Mortgage Note is the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor and is enforceable in
         accordance with its terms, except only as such enforcement may be
         limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
         and by general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding
         or action in equity or at law), and all parties to each Mortgage Loan
         and the Mortgagee had full legal capacity to execute all Mortgage Loan

                  (xix)    The terms of the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have

         Noteholders and the Note Insurer and which has been or will be
         delivered to the Indenture Trustee. The substance of any such
         alteration or modification is reflected on the Mortgage Loan Schedule
         and was approved, if required, by the related primary mortgage guaranty
         insurer, if any. Each original Mortgage was recorded, and all

         owing have been paid, or (2) an escrow of funds has been established in
         an amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid
         and which has been assessed but is not yet due and payable. Except for

         movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other casualty, so as to affect
         adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property as security for the
         Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises were intended;

                  (xxiii)  To the best of the Seller's knowledge, all of the
         improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the
         appraised value of the Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the
         boundaries and building restriction lines of such property, and no
         improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged
         Property;

                  (xxiv)   To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no improvement
         located on or being part of the Mortgaged Property is in violation of

         under applicable law;

         Mortgage Loans were paid;

                  (xxvi)   Each Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by
         any collateral, pledged account or other security except the lien of
         the corresponding Mortgage;

                  (xxvii)  No Mortgage Loan was originated under a buydown plan;


                                       8
<PAGE>


                  (xxviii) There is no obligation on the part of the Seller or
         any other party to make payments in addition to those made by the
         Mortgagor;

                  (xxix)   With respect to each Mortgage constituting a deed of
         trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such,
         has been properly designated and currently so serves and is named in
         such Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by
         the Noteholders to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in
         connection with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor;

                  (xxx)    No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature,
         or other contingent interest feature;

                  (xxxi)   The related First Lien, if any, requires equal
         monthly payments, unless such First Lien is a graduated payment
         mortgage loan or a balloon loan, or if it bears an adjustable interest
         rate, the monthly payments for the related First Lien may be adjusted
         no more frequently than monthly;

                  (xxxii)  Either (A) no consent for the Mortgage Loan is
         required by the holder of the related First Lien or (B) such consent
         has been obtained and is contained in the Mortgage File;

                  (xxxiii) The maturity date of the Mortgage Loan is prior to
         the maturity date of the related First Lien, if any, if such First Lien
         provides for a balloon payment, except if the Combined Loan-to-Value
         Ratio does not exceed 65%. No Mortgage Loan is a blanket loan; and no
         Mortgage Loan provides for negative amortization;

                  (xxxiv)  All parties which have had any interest in the
         Mortgage Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise,
         are (or, during the period in which they held and disposed of such

         state, or (D) not doing business in such state so as to require
         qualification or licensing;

                  (xxxv)   The Mortgage contains a customary provision for the
         acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the
         Mortgage Loan in the event the related security for the Mortgage Loan
         is sold without the prior consent of the mortgagee thereunder;

                  (xxxvi)  Any future advances made prior to the Cut-Off Date
         have been consolidated with the outstanding principal amount secured by
         the Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated, bears
         a single interest rate and single repayment term reflected on the
         Mortgage Loan Schedule. The consolidated principal amount does not
         exceed the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage
         Note does not permit or obligate the Seller to make future advances to
         the Mortgagor at the option of the Mortgagor;

         judicial or non-judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other

         with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or
         the right to foreclose the Mortgage except as set forth in the
         Prospectus;

                  (xxxviii)Except as set forth in (ix) above, there is no
         default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under any
         Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note and no event which, with the
         passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure
         period, would constitute a default, breach, violation or event of
         acceleration; and the Seller has not waived any default, breach,
         violation or event of acceleration;

                  (xxxix)  All parties to the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage had
         legal capacity to execute the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and each
         Mortgage Note and Mortgage have been duly and properly executed by such
         parties;

                  (xl)     All amounts received after the Cut-Off Date with
         respect to the Mortgage Loans to which the Seller is not entitled have
         been deposited into the Collection Account and are, as of the Closing
         Date, in the Collection Account;

                  (xli)    All of the Mortgage Loans were originated in

         the Trust or the Note Insurer;

                  (xliv)   All appraisals were performed by qualified
         independent appraisers after analysis of other sales of properties in
         the area in which the related Mortgaged Property is located, and a full
         interior inspection appraisal was performed on forms acceptable to
         either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in connection with each Mortgaged
         Property;

                  (xlv)    Each hazard insurance policy required to be
         maintained under Section 3.04 of this Agreement with respect to the
         Mortgage Loan is a valid, binding, enforceable and subsisting insurance
         policy of its respective kind and is in full force and effect;

                  (xlvi)   Each Mortgage Loan was originated by the Seller or an
         affiliate of the Seller;

                  (xlvii)  Each Mortgaged Property is located in the Mortgaged

         with respect to 98.25% of the Initial Mortgage Loans by Cut-Off Date
         Pool Principal Balance, the Mortgagor represented that the Mortgagor
         was occupying the related Mortgaged Property as the Mortgagor's primary
         residence. To the best of the Seller's knowledge, the Mortgaged
         Property is lawfully occupied under applicable law;

                  (l)      Each Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by
         any collateral, pledged account or other security except the lien of
         the corresponding Mortgage and the security interest of any applicable

         the Depositor with any intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its
         creditors;

                  (liv)    Reserved;

                  (lv)     For the duration of the Trust, this Agreement, the
         Indenture and the Purchase Agreement shall be treated as an official
         record of the Seller within the meaning of Section 13(e) of the Federal

         "covered," "high-risk home" or "predatory" loan under any applicable
         federal, state or local predatory or abusive lending law; and no
         Mortgage Loan originated on or after November 27, 2003, is a "high
         cost" loan subject to the New Jersey Home Ownership Security Act of

                  With respect to the representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 2.02 that are made to the best of the Seller's knowledge or as
to which the Seller has no knowledge, if it is discovered by the Depositor, the
Seller, the Servicer, the Note Insurer or a Responsible Officer of the Indenture
Trustee that the substance of such representation and warranty is inaccurate and
such inaccuracy materially and adversely affects the value of the related
Mortgage Loan then, notwithstanding the Seller's lack of knowledge with respect
to the substance of such representation and warranty being inaccurate at the
time the representation or warranty was made, such inaccuracy shall be deemed a
breach of the applicable representation or warranty.

                  (b)      It is understood and agreed that the representations
and warranties set forth in this Section 2.02 shall survive delivery of the
respective Mortgage Files to the Indenture Trustee and the termination of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.04 or 6.01. Upon
discovery by the Depositor, the Seller, the Servicer, the Note Insurer or a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing
representations and warranties, without regard to any limitation set forth
therein concerning the knowledge of the Seller as to the facts stated therein,

of breach, the Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to cure such breach in
all material respects or shall purchase from the Trust or substitute an Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan as provided in Section 2.03 for such Mortgage Loan from
the Trust.


                                       12

Any such purchase by the Seller shall be at the Purchase Price. It is understood
and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to cure, substitute or purchase any
Mortgage Loan as to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall
constitute the sole remedies against the Seller respecting such breach available
to Noteholders or the Indenture Trustee on behalf of Noteholders. An Officers'
Certificate to the effect set forth in Section 2.03(b) shall be delivered to the
Indenture Trustee in connection with any such repurchase.

                  Section 2.03. SUBSTITUTION AND REPURCHASE OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

                  (a)      On a Determination Date which is on or before the
date on which the Seller would otherwise be required to repurchase a Mortgage
Loan under Section 2.02, the Seller may deliver to the Indenture Trustee one or
more Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans in substitution for any one or more of
the Defective Mortgage Loans which the Seller would otherwise be required to
repurchase pursuant to Section 2.02.

                  (b)      The Seller shall notify the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee in writing not less than five Business Days before the related
Determination Date which is on or before the date on which the Seller would
otherwise be required to repurchase such Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.02
of its intention to effect a substitution under this Section. On such
Determination Date (the "Substitution Date"), the Seller shall deliver to the
Indenture Trustee (1) the Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans to be substituted
for the Defective Mortgage Loans, (2) a list of the Defective Mortgage Loans to
be substituted for by such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans, (3) an Officers'
Certificate (A) stating that no failure by the Servicer described in Section
6.01 shall have occurred and be continuing, (B) stating that the aggregate
principal balance of all Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans (determined with
respect to each Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan as of the Determination Date
on which it was substituted) including the principal balance of Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans being substituted on such Determination Date does not
exceed an amount equal to 5% of the sum of (i) the Cut-Off Date Pool Principal
Balance and (ii) the Original Pre-Funded Amount, (C) stating that all conditions
precedent to such substitution specified in subsection (a) have been satisfied
and attaching as an exhibit a supplemental Mortgage Loan schedule (the
"Supplemental Mortgage Loan Schedule") setting forth the same type of
information as appears on the Mortgage Loan Schedule and representing as to the
accuracy thereof, and (D) confirming that the representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.02 are true and correct in all material respects with
respect to the Substitute Mortgage Loans on and as of such Determination Date;
PROVIDED, that remedies for the inaccuracy of such representations are limited
as set forth in Section 2.02 and this Section 2.03 and (4) a certificate stating
that cash in the amount of the related Substitution Adjustment, if any, has been
deposited to the Collection Account. Upon receipt of the foregoing, the
Indenture Trustee shall release such Defective Mortgage Loans to the Seller.

                  (c)      Concurrently with the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 2.03(a) and (b) above and the grant of such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 2.03(a)
above, Exhibit A to this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to exclude all
Mortgage Loans being replaced by such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans and to
include the information set forth on the Supplemental Mortgage Loan Schedule
with respect to such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans, and all references in
this Agreement to Mortgage Loans shall include such Eligible Substitute Mortgage
Loans and be deemed to be


                                       13
<PAGE>


made on or after the related Substitution Date, as the case may be, as to such
Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans.

                  (d)      Within 60 days of the Closing Date or Subsequent
Transfer Date, as applicable, the Seller, at its own expense, shall either (i)
prepare and send for recording the Assignments of Mortgage in favor of the
Indenture Trustee in the appropriate real property or other records, or (ii)
deliver to the Indenture Trustee the Assignments of Mortgage in favor of the
Indenture Trustee in form for recordation. With respect to any Assignment of
Mortgage as to which the related recording information is unavailable within 60
days following the Closing Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable, such
Assignment of Mortgage shall be submitted for recording by the Seller within 30
days after receipt of such information, but in no event later than one year
after the date such Assignment of Mortgage is otherwise required to be recorded
pursuant to this Section 2.03(d). The Indenture Trustee shall be required to
retain a copy of each Assignment of Mortgage submitted for recording. In the
event that any such Assignment of Mortgage is lost or returned unrecorded
because of a defect therein, the Seller shall promptly prepare a substitute
Assignment of Mortgage or cure such defect, as the case may be, and thereafter
the Seller shall be required to submit each such Assignment of Mortgage for
recording. Any failure of the Seller to comply with this Section 2.03(d) , or
the discovery by any party of any defect in any documents delivered pursuant to
this Section 2.03(d) which has a material adverse effect on the value of the
Mortgage Loan, shall result in the obligation of the Seller to repurchase or
substitute an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan for the related Mortgage Loan
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, for administrative convenience and facilitation of servicing and to
reduce closing costs, the Assignments of Mortgage shall not be required to be
submitted for recording (except with respect to any Mortgage Loan located in
Maryland) unless such failure to record would result in a withdrawal or a
downgrading by any Rating Agency of the rating on the Notes, without regard to
the Note Insurance Policy; PROVIDED, FURTHER, however, each Assignment of
Mortgage shall be submitted for recording by the Servicer (in its capacity as
Seller) in the manner described above, at no expense to the Trust or the
Indenture Trustee, upon the earliest to occur of: (i) reasonable direction by
the Note Insurer or by the Holders of Notes entitled to at least 25% of the
Voting Rights, (ii) the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Loss Event, (iii)
the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or foreclosure relating to the
Seller, (iv) the occurrence of a servicing transfer as described in Section 5.02
hereof, (v) if the Seller is not the Servicer and (vi) with respect to any one
Assignment of Mortgage, the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
foreclosure relating to the Mortgagor under the related Mortgage.

                  (e)      If the Seller is given notice under Section 2.03 of
the Indenture and if the Seller does not correct or cure such omission or defect
within the 90-day period specified in such section, the Seller shall purchase or
substitute such Mortgage Loan from the Indenture Trustee on the Determination
Date in the month following the month in which such 90-day period expired at the
Purchase Price of such Mortgage Loan. The Purchase Price for the purchased
Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Collection Account no later than the
applicable Determination Date or the Business Day preceding the expiration of
such 90-day period, as the case may be, and, upon receipt by the Indenture
Trustee of written notification of such deposit, signed by an officer of the
Seller, the Indenture Trustee shall release to the Seller the related Mortgage
File and the Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or
assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the
Seller or its


                                       14
<PAGE>


designee any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto. It is understood and agreed
that the obligation of the Seller to purchase any Mortgage Loan as to which a
material defect in or omission of a constituent document exists shall constitute
the sole remedy against the Seller respecting such defect or omission available
to the Note Insurer, the Noteholders or the Indenture Trustee on behalf of
Noteholders.

                  The Servicer, promptly following the transfer of (i) a
Defective Mortgage Loan from, or (ii) an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan to
the Trust pursuant to this Section shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule,
appropriately mark the Electronic Ledger and make appropriate entries in its
general account records to reflect such transfer and the addition of any
Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan, if applicable.

                  Section 2.04. EXISTENCE. The Issuer will keep in full effect
its existence, rights and franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the
State of Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is or
becomes, organized under the laws of any other state or of the United States of
America, in which case the Issuer will keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises under the laws of such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and
preserve its qualification to do business in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Servicing Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III

                               ADMINISTRATION AND
                          SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS

                  Section 3.01. THE SERVICER.

                  (a)      The Servicer, as independent contract servicer, shall
service and administer the Mortgage Loans and shall have full power and
authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such
servicing and administration which the Servicer may deem necessary or desirable
and consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer may enter into
Subservicing Agreements for any servicing and administration of Mortgage Loans
with any institution which is in compliance with the laws of each state
necessary to enable it to perform its obligations under such Subservicing
Agreement and (1) (x) has been designated an approved Seller-Servicer by Freddie
Mac or Fannie Mae for first and second mortgage loans, or (y) is an affiliate of
the Servicer, or (2) is otherwise approved by the Note Insurer and the Class A
Noteholders aggregating 51% of the Percentage Interests thereof. The Servicer
shall give notice to the Note Insurer and the Indenture Trustee of the
appointment of any Subservicer. Any such Subservicing Agreement shall be
consistent with and not violate the provisions of this Agreement. The Servicer
shall be entitled to terminate any Subservicing Agreement in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such Subservicing Agreement and either itself directly
service the related Mortgage Loans or enter into a Subservicing Agreement with a
successor subservicer which qualifies hereunder.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding any Subservicing Agreement, any of
the provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between
the Servicer and Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer
or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated


                                       15
<PAGE>


and primarily liable for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage Loans
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without diminution of such
obligation or liability by virtue of such Subservicing Agreements or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the Subservicer and to the
same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone
were servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans. For purposes of this
Agreement, the Servicer shall be deemed to have received payments on Mortgage
Loans when the Subservicer has received such payments. The Servicer shall be
entitled to enter into any agreement with a Subservicer for indemnification of
the Servicer by such Subservicer, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

                  (c)      Any Subservicing Agreement that may be entered into
and any transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a
Subservicer in its capacity as such and not as an originator shall be deemed to
be between the Subservicer and the Servicer alone, and the Indenture Trustee and
Noteholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights, obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to the Subservicer
except as set forth in Section 3.01(d). The Servicer shall be solely liable for
all fees owed by it to any Subservicer irrespective of whether the Servicer's
compensation pursuant to this Agreement is sufficient to pay such fees.

                  (d)      In the event the Servicer shall for any reason no
longer be the Servicer (including by reason of a Servicer Event of Default), the
Indenture Trustee or its designee approved by the Note Insurer shall thereupon
assume all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under each Subservicing
Agreement that the Servicer may have entered into, unless the Indenture Trustee
or designee approved by the Note Insurer elects to terminate any Subservicing
Agreement. Any fee payable in connection with such a termination will be payable
by the outgoing Servicer. If the Indenture Trustee does not terminate a
Subservicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee, its designee or the successor
servicer for the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to have assumed all of the
Servicer's interest therein and to have replaced the Servicer as a party to each
Subservicing Agreement to the same extent as if the Subservicing Agreements had
been assigned to the assuming party, except that the Servicer shall not thereby
be relieved of any liability or obligations under the Subservicing Agreements
with regard to events that occurred prior to the date the Servicer ceased to be
the Servicer hereunder. The Servicer at its expense and without right of
reimbursement therefor, shall, upon request of the Indenture Trustee, deliver to
the assuming party all documents and records relating to each Subservicing
Agreement and the Mortgage Loans then being serviced and an accounting of
amounts collected and held by it and otherwise use its best efforts to effect
the orderly and efficient transfer of the Subservicing Agreements to the
assuming party.

                  (e)      Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the
Servicer may waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to
the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant
indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Servicer's determination such waiver,
modification, postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the
interests of the Noteholders and the Note Insurer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
(unless (x) the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage Loan, or
such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer, imminent, and (y) with respect
to any modification lowering the Loan Rate or effecting the forgiveness of any
amount owed under the Mortgage Note, or extending the final maturity date on
such Mortgage Loan, the Note Insurer has consented to such


                                       16
<PAGE>


modification) the Servicer may not permit any modification with respect to any
Mortgage Loan that would change the Loan Rate, defer or forgive the payment of
any principal or interest (unless in connection with the liquidation of the
related Mortgage Loan) or extend the final maturity date on the Mortgage Loan.
No costs incurred by the Servicer or any Subservicer in respect of Servicing
Advances shall for the purposes of payments to Noteholders be added to the
amount owing under the related Mortgage Loan. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Servicer shall continue, and is hereby authorized and
empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of the Indenture Trustee and each
Noteholder, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or
full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If reasonably
required by the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with
any powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable
the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Servicer, in servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, shall employ or
cause to be employed procedures (including collection, foreclosure and REO
Property management procedures) and exercise the same care that it customarily
employs and exercises in servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own
account, in accordance with accepted first and second mortgage servicing
practices of prudent lending institutions and giving due consideration to the
Note Insurer's and the Noteholders reliance on the Servicer.

                  (f)      On and after such time as the Indenture Trustee
receives the resignation of, or notice of the removal of, the Servicer from its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, and with respect to resignation
pursuant to Section 5.04, after receipt by the Indenture Trustee and the Note
Insurer of the Opinion of Counsel required pursuant to Section 5.04, the
Indenture Trustee or its designee approved by the Note Insurer shall assume all
of the rights and obligations of the Servicer, subject to Section 6.02 hereof.
The Servicer shall, upon request of the Indenture Trustee but at the expense of
the Servicer, deliver to the Indenture Trustee all documents and records
relating to the Mortgage Loans and an accounting of amounts collected and held
by the Servicer and otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and
efficient transfer of servicing rights and obligations to the assuming party.

                  (g)      The Servicer shall deliver a list of Servicing
Officers to the Indenture Trustee and the Note Insurer by the Closing Date.

                  (h)      Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the
Servicer may consent to the placing of a lien senior to that of the Mortgage on
the related Mortgaged Property; PROVIDED, that such senior lien secures a
mortgage loan that refinances a First Lien and the combined loan-to-value ratio
of the related Mortgage Loan immediately following the refinancing (based on the
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and the original principal
balance of such refinanced mortgage loan) is not greater than the Combined
Loan-to-Value Ratio of such Mortgage Loan as of the Cut-Off Date.

                  Section 3.02. COLLECTION OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS.

                  (a)      The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect
all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loans,
and shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this
Agreement, follow such collection procedures as it follows with respect to
mortgage loans in its servicing portfolio which are comparable to the Mortgage
Loans. Consistent with the foregoing, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Servicer may in its discretion (i) waive any late payment charge
or any assumption fees or other fees which may be collected in the ordinary
course of servicing such Mortgage Loan, and (ii) arrange with a Mortgagor a
schedule for the payment of interest due and unpaid; PROVIDED such arrangement
is consistent with the Servicer's policies with respect to the mortgage loans it
owns or services; PROVIDED, further, that notwithstanding such arrangement such
Mortgage Loans shall be included in the monthly information delivered by the
Servicer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 7.05 of the Indenture.

                  (b)      The Servicer shall establish and maintain for the
benefit of the Noteholders and the Note Insurer with Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company a segregated non-interest bearing trust account (the "Collection
Account") titled "Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee, in
trust for the registered holders of Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust Asset Backed
Notes, Series 2004-2." The Collection Account shall be an Eligible Account. The
Servicer shall on the Closing Date and on each Subsequent Transfer Date deposit
any amounts representing payments on and any collections in respect of the
Mortgage Loans received after the related Cut-Off Date and prior to the Closing
Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable, and thereafter shall use its
best efforts to deposit within one Business Day, and shall in any event deposit
within two Business Days following receipt thereof the following payments and
collections received or made by it (without duplication):

                  (i)      all payments received after the Cut-Off Date on
         account of principal on the Mortgage Loans and all Principal
         Prepayments and Curtailments collected after the Cut-Off Date;

                  (ii)     all payments received after the Cut-Off Date on
         account of interest on the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of payments in
         respect of interest on the Initial Mortgage Loans which has accrued
         through the related Due Date in November 2004 and on the Subsequent
         Mortgage Loans which has accrued through the related Due Date in the
         month preceding the Subsequent Transfer Date).

                  (iii)    all Net Liquidation Proceeds net of Foreclosure
         Profits;

                  (iv)     all Insurance Proceeds;

                  (v)      all Released Mortgaged Property Proceeds;

                  (vi)     any amounts payable in connection with the repurchase
         of any Mortgage Loan and the amount of any Substitution Adjustment
         pursuant to Sections 2.02 and 2.03; and


                                       18
<PAGE>


                  (vii)    any amount required to be deposited in the Collection
         Account pursuant to Sections 3.05, 3.07, 3.16, 3.17 hereof and Section
         3.10 of the Indenture;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, with respect to each Due Period, the Servicer shall be
permitted to retain, from payments in respect of interest on the Mortgage Loans,
the Servicing Fee for such Due Period. The foregoing requirements respecting
deposits to the Collection Account are exclusive, it being understood that,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer need not deposit
into the Collection Account amounts representing Foreclosure Profits, fees
(including annual fees) or late charge penalties or prepayment penalties payable
by Mortgagors, or amounts received by the Servicer for the accounts of
Mortgagors for application towards the payment of taxes, insurance premiums,
assessments and similar items.

                  (c)      [Reserved].

                  (d)      The Servicer may cause the institution maintaining
the Collection Account to invest any funds in the Collection Account in Eligible
Investments (including obligations of the Servicer or any of its Affiliates, if
such obligations otherwise qualify as Eligible Investments) pursuant to Section
3.10 of the Indenture.

                  Section 3.03. WITHDRAWALS FROM THE COLLECTION ACCOUNT.

                  The Indenture Trustee shall withdraw or cause to be withdrawn
funds from the Collection Account for the following purposes:

                  (i)      on the Business Day prior to each Payment Date, to
         deposit the portion of the Available Funds then in the Collection
         Account to the Payment Account;

                  (ii)     to reimburse the Servicer for any accrued and unpaid
         Servicing Fees and for unreimbursed Monthly Advances and Servicing
         Advances. The Servicer's right to reimbursement for unpaid Servicing
         Fees and unreimbursed Servicing Advances shall be limited to late
         collections on the related Mortgage Loan, including Liquidation
         Proceeds, Released Mortgaged Property Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and
         such other amounts as may be collected by the Servicer from the related
         Mortgagor or otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan in respect of
         which such reimbursed amounts are owed. The Servicer's right to
         reimbursement for unreimbursed Monthly Advances shall be limited to
         late collections of interest on any Mortgage Loan and to Liquidation
         Proceeds, Released Mortgaged Property Proceeds and Insurance Proceeds
         on related Mortgage Loans;

                  (iii)    to withdraw any amount received from a Mortgagor that
         is recoverable and sought to be recovered as a voidable preference by a
         trustee in bankruptcy pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code in
         accordance with a final, nonappealable order of a court having
         competent jurisdiction;

                  (iv)     (a) to make investments in Eligible Investments, and
         (b) subject to Section 3.10(e) of the Indenture, to pay to the Spread
         Account or the Servicer, as the case may be, interest earned in respect
         of Eligible Investments or on funds deposited in the Collection
         Account;


                                       19
<PAGE>


                  (v)      to withdraw any funds deposited in the Collection
         Account that were not required to be deposited therein (such as
         Servicing Compensation) or were deposited therein in error and to pay
         such funds to the appropriate Person;

                  (vi)     to pay the Servicer Servicing Compensation pursuant
         to Section 3.09 hereof to the extent not retained or paid pursuant to
         Section 3.02(b);

                  (vii)    to withdraw funds necessary for the conservation and
         disposition of REO Property pursuant to Section 3.07;

                  (viii)   to reimburse the Servicer for (a) Nonrecoverable
         Advances that are not, with respect to aggregate Servicing Advances on
         any single Mortgage Loan or REO Property, in excess of the Principal
         Balance thereof, and (b) expenses incurred pursuant to Section 5.03;

                  (ix)     to pay on the first Payment Date to the Seller
         collections received in respect of accrued interest on the Initial
         Mortgage Loans through the related Due Date in December 2004 and to pay
         on the Payment Date following a Subsequent Transfer Date to the Seller
         collections received in respect of accrued interest on the Subsequent
         Mortgage Loans through the related Due Date in the month preceding the
         Subsequent Transfer Date;

                  (x)      to clear and terminate the Collection Account upon
         the termination of this Agreement and to pay any amounts remaining
         therein to the Certificateholders; and

                  (xi)     to pay itself from payments in respect of interest on
         the Mortgage Loans, the Indenture Trustee Fee for such Due Period.

                  Section 3.04. MAINTENANCE OF HAZARD INSURANCE; PROPERTY
PROTECTION EXPENSES.

                  The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan fire and hazard insurance naming the Servicer as loss payee thereunder
providing extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser
of (i) the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing such Mortgage
Loan from time to time, (ii) the combined principal balance owing on such
Mortgage Loan and any mortgage loan senior to such Mortgage Loan, and (iii) the
minimum amount required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost
basis. The Servicer shall also maintain on property acquired upon foreclosure,
or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, hazard insurance with extended coverage in an
amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value
from time to time of the improvements which are a part of such property, (ii)
the combined principal balance owing on such Mortgage Loan and any mortgage loan
senior to such Mortgage Loan, and (iii) the minimum amount required to
compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost basis at the time of such
foreclosure, fire and/or deed in lieu of foreclosure plus accrued interest and
the good-faith estimate of the Servicer of related Servicing Advances to be
incurred in connection therewith. Amounts collected by the Servicer under any
such policies shall be deposited in the Collection Account to the extent
required by Section 3.02. In cases in which any Mortgaged Property is located in
a federally designated flood area, the hazard insurance to be maintained for the
related Mortgage


                                       20
<PAGE>


Loan shall include flood insurance to the extent such flood insurance is
available and the Servicer has determined such insurance to be necessary in
accordance with accepted second mortgage loan servicing standards. All such
flood insurance shall be in amounts equal to the least of the amount in clause
(i) above, clause (ii) above and the maximum amount of insurance available under
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1994, as amended. The Servicer shall be
under no obligation to require that any Mortgagor maintain earthquake or other
additional insurance and shall be under no obligation itself to maintain any
such additional insurance on property acquired in respect of a Mortgage Loan,
other than pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time
be in force and as shall require such additional insurance.

                  Section 3.05. MAINTENANCE OF MORTGAGE IMPAIRMENT INSURANCE
POLICY.

                  In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy with an insurer either (A) having a General Policy rating of
A:VIII or better in Best's Key Rating Guide, or (B) approved by the Note
Insurer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, insuring against fire
and hazards of extended coverage on all of the Mortgage Loans, then, to the
extent such policy names the Servicer as loss payee and provides coverage in an
amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal balance on the Mortgage Loans
without co-insurance, and otherwise complies with the requirements of Section
3.04, the Servicer shall be deemed conclusively to have satisfied its
obligations with respect to fire and hazard insurance coverage under Section
3.04, it being understood and agreed that such blanket policy may contain a
deductible clause, in which case the Servicer shall, in the event that there
shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property a policy
complying with Section 3.04, and there shall have been a loss which would have
been covered by such policy, deposit into the Collection Account the difference,
if any, between the amount that would have been payable under a policy complying
with Section 3.04 and the amount paid under such blanket policy. Upon the
request of the Note Insurer or the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer shall cause
to be delivered to the Note Insurer or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may
be, a certified true copy of such policy. In connection with its activities as
administrator and servicer of the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer agrees to prepare
and present, on behalf of itself, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and
Noteholders, claims under any such policy in a timely fashion in accordance with
the terms of such policy.

                  Section 3.06. FIDELITY BOND.

                  The Servicer shall maintain with a responsible company, and at
its own expense, a blanket fidelity bond and an errors and omissions insurance
policy, in a minimum amount acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or otherwise
in an amount as is commercially available at a cost that is not generally
regarded as excessive by industry standards, with broad coverage on all
officers, employees or other persons acting in any capacity requiring such
persons to handle funds, money, documents or papers relating to the Mortgage
Loans ("Servicer Employees"). Any such fidelity bond and errors and omissions
insurance shall protect and insure the Servicer against losses, including losses
resulting from forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Servicer Employees. Such fidelity bond shall also protect
and insure the Servicer against losses in connection with the release or
satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without having obtained payment in full of the
indebtedness secured thereby. No provision of this Section 3.06 requiring such
fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance shall diminish or relieve the
Servicer from its duties and obligations as set forth in this


                                       21
<PAGE>


Agreement. Upon the request of the Indenture Trustee or the Note Insurer, the
Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the Indenture Trustee or the Note
Insurer a certified true copy of such fidelity bond and insurance policy. On the
Closing Date, such bond and insurance is maintained with certain underwriters at
St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company and Lloyds of London.

                  Section 3.07. MANAGEMENT AND REALIZATION UPON DEFAULTED
MORTGAGE LOANS.

                  The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
REO Property for the Noteholders and the Note Insurer solely for the purpose of
its prudent and prompt disposition and sale. The Servicer shall, either itself
or through an agent selected by the Servicer, manage, conserve, protect and
operate the REO Property in the same manner that it manages, conserves, protects
and operates other foreclosed property for its own account, and in the same
manner that similar property in the same locality as the REO Property is
managed. The Servicer shall attempt to sell the same (and may temporarily rent
the same) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer deems to be in the best
interest of the Note Insurer and the Noteholders.

                  The Servicer shall cause to be deposited, no later than two
Business Days after the receipt thereof, in the Collection Account, all revenues
received with respect to the related REO Property and shall retain, or cause the
Indenture Trustee to withdraw therefrom funds necessary for the proper
operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property and the fees of any
managing agent acting on behalf of the Servicer.

                  The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Servicer for cash at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the
Servicer deems to be in the best interest of the Noteholders and the Note
Insurer and, as soon as practicable thereafter, the expenses of such sale shall
be paid. The cash proceeds of sale of the REO Property shall be promptly
deposited in the Collection Account, net of Foreclosure Profits and of any
related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees and
unreimbursed Monthly Advances payable to the Servicer in accordance with Section
3.03, for payment to the Noteholders in accordance with Section 3.05 of the
Indenture.

                  The Servicer shall foreclose upon or otherwise comparably
convert to ownership Mortgaged Properties securing such of the Mortgage Loans as
come into and continue in default when no satisfactory arrangements can be made
for collection of delinquent payments pursuant to Section 3.02 subject to the
provisions contained in the last paragraph of this Section 3.07.

                  In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of
sale shall be issued to the Indenture Trustee, or to its nominee on behalf of
Noteholders and the Note Insurer.

                  If the Servicer has actual knowledge that a Mortgaged Property
which the Servicer is contemplating acquiring in foreclosure or by deed in lieu
of foreclosure is located within a 1 mile radius of any site with environmental
or hazardous waste risks known to the Servicer, the Servicer will notify the
Note Insurer prior to acquiring such Mortgaged Property and shall not take any
action in furtherance thereof without the prior written approval of the Note
Insurer. Nothing in this Section shall affect the Servicer's right to deem
certain advances proposed to be made by the Servicer as Nonrecoverable Advances.
For the purposes of this


                                       22
<PAGE>


Section 3.07, actual knowledge of the Servicer means actual knowledge of a
Responsible Officer of the Servicer involved in the servicing of the relevant
Mortgage Loan. Actual knowledge of the Servicer does not include knowledge
imputable by virtue of the availability of or accessibility to information
relating to environmental or hazardous waste sites or the locations thereof.

                  Section 3.08. INDENTURE TRUSTEE TO COOPERATE.

                  Upon any Principal Prepayment in full, the Servicer is
authorized to execute, pursuant to the authorization contained in Section
3.01(e), if the related Assignment of Mortgage has been recorded as required
hereunder, an instrument of satisfaction regarding the related Mortgage, which
instrument of satisfaction shall be recorded by the Servicer if required by
applicable law and be delivered to the Person entitled thereto. It is understood
and agreed that no expenses incurred in connection with such instrument of
satisfaction or transfer shall be reimbursed from amounts deposited in the
Collection Account. If the Indenture Trustee is holding the Mortgage Files, from
time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure of any Mortgage
Loan, the Indenture Trustee shall, upon request by the Servicer and delivery to
the Indenture Trustee of a Request for Release, in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit B, signed by a Servicing Officer, release the related Mortgage File to
the Servicer, and the Indenture Trustee shall execute such documents at the
direction of and in the forms provided by the Servicer, as shall be necessary to
the prosecution of any such proceedings or the taking of other servicing
actions. Such Request for Release shall obligate the Servicer to return the
Mortgage File to the Indenture Trustee when the need therefor by the Servicer no
longer exists unless the Mortgage Loan shall be liquidated, in which case, upon
receipt of a certificate of a Servicing Officer similar to that hereinabove
specified, the Request for Release shall be released by the Indenture Trustee to
the Servicer.

                  In order to facilitate the foreclosure of the Mortgage
securing any Mortgage Loan that is in default following recordation of the
related Assignment of Mortgage in accordance with the provisions hereof, the
Indenture Trustee shall, if so requested in writing by the Servicer, execute an
appropriate assignment in the form provided to the Indenture Trustee by the
Servicer to assign such Mortgage Loan for the purpose of collection, to the
Servicer (any such assignment shall unambiguously indicate that the assignment
is for the purposes of collection only), and, upon such assignment, such
assignee for collection will thereupon bring all required actions in its own
name and otherwise enforce the terms of the Mortgage Loan and deposit or credit
the Net Liquidation Proceeds, exclusive of Foreclosure Profits, received with
respect thereto in the Collection Account. In the event that all delinquent
payments due under any such Mortgage Loan are paid by the Mortgagor and any
other defaults are cured, then the assignee for collection shall promptly
reassign such Mortgage Loan to the Indenture Trustee and return it to the place
where the related Mortgage File was previously being maintained.

                  Section 3.09. SERVICING COMPENSATION; PAYMENT OF CERTAIN
EXPENSES BY SERVICER.

                  Subject to Section 3.17, the Servicer shall be entitled to
retain the Servicing Fee in accordance with Section 3.02 as compensation for its
services in connection with servicing the Mortgage Loans; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Servicer shall not retain or receive a Servicing Fee with respect to
accrued interest included as part of the Purchase Price of a Mortgage Loan if
such accrued interest was computed at the Net Loan Rate. Moreover, additional
servicing


                                       23
<PAGE>


compensation in the form of late payment charges, prepayment penalties or other
receipts not required to be deposited in the Collection Account, including,
without limitation, Foreclosure Profits, and, subject to Section 3.10 of the
Indenture, investment income on the Accounts (other than the Spread Account)
shall be retained by the Servicer. The Servicer shall be required to pay all
expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities hereunder (including
payment of all other fees and expenses not expressly stated hereunder to be for
the account of the Trust or the Noteholders) and shall not be entitled to
reimbursement therefor except as specifically provided herein.

                  Section 3.10. ANNUAL STATEMENT AS TO COMPLIANCE.

                  (a)      The Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee,
the Note Insurer and the Rating Agencies, on or before March 15th of each
applicable year, beginning in 2005 (and covering the calendar year ending in
2004), an Officer's Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached
hereto stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the
preceding calendar year (or such shorter period as is applicable in the case of
the first report) and of its performance under this Agreement has been made
under such officer's supervision, and (ii) to the best of such officer's
knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its material
obligations under this Agreement throughout such calendar year, or, if there has
been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such
default known to such officer and the nature and status thereof. The Servicer
shall promptly notify the Note Insurer, the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee,
Standard & Poor's and Moody's upon any change in the basis on which its calendar
year is determined.

                  (b)      The Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee,
the Note Insurer, the Depositor and each of the Rating Agencies, promptly after
having obtained knowledge thereof, but in no event later than five Business Days
thereafter, written notice by means of an Officer's Certificate of any event
which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would become a
Servicer Event of Default.

                  Section 3.11. ANNUAL SERVICING REPORT.

                  Not later than March 15th of each applicable year, beginning
in 2005 (and covering the calendar year ending in 2004), the Servicer, at its
expense, shall cause a firm of independent public accountants reasonably
acceptable to the Indenture Trustee and the Note Insurer to furnish a letter or
letters to the Note Insurer, the Indenture Trustee, Standard & Poor's and
Moody's to the effect that such firm has, with respect to the Servicer's overall
servicing operations, examined such operations in accordance with the
requirements of the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, and
stating such firm's conclusions relating thereto.

                  Section 3.12. ACCESS TO CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION
REGARDING THE MORTGAGE LOANS.

                  The Servicer shall provide to the Indenture Trustee, the Note
Insurer, Noteholders which are federally insured savings and loan associations,
the Office of Thrift Supervision, the FDIC and the supervisory agents and
examiners of the Office of Thrift Supervision access to the documentation
regarding the Mortgage Loans required by applicable regulations of the Office of


                                       24
<PAGE>


Thrift Supervision and the FDIC (acting as operator of the SAIF or the BIF),
such access being afforded without charge, but only upon reasonable request, and
during normal business hours at the Offices of the Servicer. Nothing in this
Section 3.12 shall derogate from the obligation of the Servicer to observe any
applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding the Mortgagors
and the failure of the Servicer to provide access as provided in this Section
3.12 as a result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this
Section 3.12.

                  Section 3.13. [RESERVED].

                  Section 3.14. REPORTS TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.

                  (a)      The Indenture Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with
the Servicer in connection with the Trust's satisfying the reporting
requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"). The Indenture Trustee shall prepare on behalf of the Trust any
Forms 8-K and 10-K customary for similar securities as required by the Exchange
Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") thereunder, and the Servicer shall sign (or shall cause another
entity acceptable to the Commission to sign) and the Indenture Trustee shall
file (via the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval System) such
forms on behalf of the Depositor or the Issuer (or such other entity). The
Depositor and the Issuer hereby grant to the Indenture Trustee a limited power
of attorney to execute any Form 8-K and 10-K and file each such document on
behalf of the Depositor, but only to the extent no accompanying certification is
required to be filed on behalf of the Depositor and the Issuer. Such power of
attorney shall continue until the earlier of (i) receipt by the Indenture
Trustee from the Depositor and the Issuer of written termination of such power
of attorney and (ii) the termination of the Trust. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Servicer, and not the Indenture Trustee, shall be
responsible for executing each Form 10-K filed on behalf of the Trust.

                  (b)      Each Form 8-K shall be filed by the Indenture Trustee
within 15 days after each Payment Date, with a copy of the statement to the
Noteholders for such Payment Date as an exhibit thereto. Prior to March 30th of
each year (or such earlier date as may be required by the Exchange Act and the
Rules and Regulations of the Commission), until the year after the year in which
a Form 15 Suspension Notification is filed under Section 3.14(e), the Indenture
Trustee shall file a Form 10-K, in substance as required by applicable law or
applicable Commission staff's interpretations. Such Form 10-K shall include as
exhibits the Servicer's annual statement of compliance described under Section
3.10 and the accountant's report described under Section 3.11, in each case to
the extent that they have been timely delivered to the Indenture Trustee and
upon which the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely. If they are not so
timely delivered, the Indenture Trustee shall file an amended Form 10-K
including such documents as exhibits reasonably promptly after they are
delivered to the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee shall have no
liability with respect to any failure to properly prepare or file such periodic
reports resulting from or relating to the Indenture Trustee's inability or
failure to obtain any information not resulting from its own negligence or
willful misconduct. The Form 10-K shall also include a certification in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 (the "Certification"), which shall be signed by
the senior officer of the Servicer in charge of servicing.

                  (c)      In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall sign a
certification (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2) for the benefit of
the Servicer and its officers, directors and Affiliates regarding certain
aspects of the Certification (provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee
shall not undertake an analysis of the accountant's report attached as an
exhibit to the Form 10-K). The Indenture Trustee's certification shall be
delivered to the Servicer by no later than March 18th of each year (or if such
day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) and the
Servicer shall deliver the Certification to the Indenture Trustee for filing no
later than March 20th of each year (or if such day is not a Business Day, the
immediately preceding Business Day).

                  In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Servicer and its officers, directors and Affiliates from and
against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and
necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses
arising out of or based upon a breach of the Indenture Trustee's obligations
under this Section 3.14 or the Indenture Trustee's negligence, bad faith,
willful misconduct or gross negligence in connection therewith. If the
indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold
harmless the Servicer, then the Indenture Trustee, in connection with a breach
of the Indenture Trustee's obligations under this Section 3.14 or the Indenture
Trustee's bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence in connection
therewith, agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Servicer as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the
Servicer in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Servicer on the one hand and the Indenture Trustee on the other.

                  If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is
unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the Indenture Trustee, then the
Servicer, in connection with a breach of the Servicer's obligations under this
Section 3.14 or the Servicer's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in
connection therewith, agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the Indenture Trustee as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities of the Indenture Trustee in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indenture Trustee on the one hand and the
Servicer on the other.

                  (d)      Upon any filing with the Commission, the Indenture
Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Servicer a copy of any executed report,
statement or information.

                  (e)      Prior to January 30th of the first year in which the
Indenture Trustee is able to do so under applicable law, the Indenture Trustee
shall file a Form 15 Suspension Notification with respect to the Trust.

                  (f)      To the extent that, following the Closing Date, the
content of Forms 8-K, 10-K or other Forms required by the Exchange Act and the
Rules and Regulations of the Commission and the time by which such Forms are
required to be filed, differs from the provisions of this Section 3.14, the
provisions of this Section 3.14 shall be deemed amended to conform to such new
requirements, and the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor hereby agree that each
shall reasonably cooperate to amend the provisions of this Section 3.14 (in
accordance with Section 11.01) in order to comply with such amended reporting
requirements and such amendment of this Section 3.14. Any such amendment may
result in the reduction of the reports filed by the Servicer under the Exchange
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the


                                       26
<PAGE>


Servicer nor the Indenture Trustee shall be obligated to enter into any
amendment pursuant to this Section that adversely affects its obligations and
immunities under this Agreement.

                  Section 3.15. REPORTS OF FORECLOSURES AND ABANDONMENTS OF
MORTGAGED PROPERTY; RETURNS RELATING TO MORTGAGE INTEREST RECEIVED FROM
INDIVIDUALS AND RETURNS RELATING TO CANCELLATION OF INDEBTEDNESS.

                  The Servicer shall make reports of foreclosures and
abandonments of any Mortgaged Property for each year beginning in 2005. The
Servicer shall file reports relating to each instance occurring during the
previous calendar year in which the Servicer (i) on behalf of the Indenture
Trustee acquires an interest in any Mortgaged Property through foreclosure or
other comparable conversion in full or partial satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan,
or (ii) knows or has reason to know that any Mortgaged Property has been
abandoned. The reports from the Servicer shall be in form and substance
sufficient to meet the reporting requirements imposed by Sections 6050J, 6050H
and 6050P of the Code.

                  Section 3.16. ADVANCES BY THE SERVICER.

                  (a)      Not later than the close of business on each
Determination Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Indenture Trustee for
deposit into the Collection Account an amount (as indicated in the Indenture
Trustee's Remittance report prepared pursuant to Section 4.01), to be paid on
the related Payment Date pursuant to Section 3.05 of the Indenture, equal to the
sum of (a) all payments of interest due on each Mortgage Loan during the related
Due Period as to which no payment was received as of the close of business on
the last day of the related Due Period (net of the Servicing Fee), and (b) with
respect to each REO Property that was acquired during or prior to the related
Due Period, and as to which an REO Property disposition did not occur during the
related Due Period, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of interest on the
Principal Balance of such REO Property at the Loan Rate less the Servicing Fee
for the most recently ended Due Period prior to the related Determination Date
for the related Mortgage Loan over the net income from the REO Property
transferred to the Collection Account for such Payment Date pursuant to Section
3.07 (such sum; the "Monthly Advance").

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Servicing Advance or Monthly Advance shall be required to be made hereunder if
the Servicer determines that such Servicing Advance or Monthly Advance would, if
made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.

                  Section 3.17. COMPENSATING INTEREST.

                  Not later than the close of business on each Determination
Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Indenture Trustee for deposit to the
Collection Account an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the aggregate of the
Prepayment Interest Shortfalls for the related Payment Date resulting from
Principal Prepayments during the related Due Period and (B) its aggregate
Servicing Fees received in the related Due Period. The Servicer shall not have
the right to reimbursement for any amounts deposited to the Collection Account
pursuant to this Section.


                                       27

                  Section 3.18. SUPERIOR LIENS.

                  The Servicer shall file (or cause to be filed) of record a
request for notice of any action by a superior lienholder under a First Lien for
the protection of the Indenture Trustee's interest, where permitted by local law
and whenever applicable state law does not require that a junior lienholder be
named as a party defendant in foreclosure proceedings in order to foreclose such
junior lienholder's equity of redemption.

                  If the Servicer is notified that any superior lienholder has
accelerated or intends to accelerate the obligations secured by the First Lien,
or has declared or intends to declare a default under the mortgage or the
promissory note secured thereby, or has filed or intends to file an election to
have the Mortgaged Property sold or foreclosed, the Servicer shall take, on
behalf of the Trust, whatever actions are necessary to protect the interests of
the Noteholders and the Note Insurer, and/or to preserve the security of the
related Mortgage Loan, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
Servicer shall immediately notify the Indenture Trustee and the Note Insurer of
any such action or circumstances. The Servicer shall advance the necessary funds
to cure the default or reinstate the superior lien, if such advance is in the
best interests of the Note Insurer and the Noteholders which the Servicer may
establish by seeking approval from the Note Insurer as evidenced by written
instruction from the Note Insurer. Any action or inaction on the part of the
Servicer in accordance with such written instructions shall be deemed to be in
the best interests of the Note Insurer and the Noteholders. If no written
response is received within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the Note
Insurer of such request for approval, the Servicer may advance or not advance in
accordance with the second preceding sentence, without liability to the
Noteholders or the Note Insurer. The Servicer shall not make such an advance
except to the extent that it determines in its reasonable good faith judgment
that the advance would be recoverable from Liquidation Proceeds on the related
Mortgage Loan and in no event in an amount that is greater than the Principal
Balance of the related Mortgage Loan, except with the consent of the Note
Insurer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Servicer shall
thereafter take such action as is necessary to recover the amount so advanced.

                  Section 3.19. ASSUMPTION AGREEMENTS.

                  When a Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be conveyed
by a Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such
conveyance or prospective conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate the
maturity of the related Mortgage Loan under any "due-on-sale" clause contained
in the related Mortgage or Mortgage Note; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Servicer
shall not exercise any such right if (i) the "due-on-sale" clause, in the
reasonable belief of the Servicer, is not enforceable under applicable law, or
(ii) the Servicer, in a manner consistent with reasonable commercial practice,
permits the purchaser of the related Mortgaged Property to assume the Mortgage
Loan. In such event, the Servicer shall enter into an assumption and
modification agreement with the person to whom such property has been or is
about to be conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the
Mortgage Note and, unless prohibited by applicable law, the Mortgagor remains
liable thereon. The Servicer is also authorized, with the prior approval of the
Note Insurer, to enter into a substitution of liability agreement with such
person and such person will be substituted as mortgagor and become liable under
the Mortgage Note; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Servicer shall have no liability
under this Section 3.19 if the Note Insurer fails to respond to notice by the
Servicer of a proposed


                                       28
<PAGE>


substitution within two (2) Business Days of receipt thereof by the Note
Insurer; PROVIDED, that the Servicer acts in accordance with the servicing
standards set forth in this Agreement. The Servicer shall notify the Indenture
Trustee and the Note Insurer that any such substitution or assumption agreement
has been completed by forwarding to the Indenture Trustee the original of such
substitution or assumption agreement and a duplicate thereof to the Note
Insurer, which original shall be added by the Indenture Trustee to the related
Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a part of such Mortgage
File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments constituting a
part thereof. In connection with any assumption or substitution agreement
entered into pursuant to this Section 3.19, the Servicer shall not change the
Loan Rate or the Monthly Payment, defer or forgive the payment of principal or
interest, reduce the outstanding principal amount or extend the final maturity
date on such Mortgage Loan.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph or any other provision
of this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default, breach of,
or in any other violation of its obligations hereunder by reason of any
assumption of a Mortgage Loan by operation of law or any assumption which the
Servicer may be restricted by law from preventing, for any reason whatsoever.

                  Section 3.20. PAYMENT OF TAXES, INSURANCE AND OTHER CHARGES.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
maintain accurate records reflecting fire and hazard insurance coverage.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan as to which the Servicer
maintains escrow accounts, the Servicer shall maintain accurate records
reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates and other
charges which are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the
status of primary mortgage guaranty insurance premiums, if any, and fire and
hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all bills for the
payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and shall effect payment
thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date and at a time
appropriate for securing maximum discounts allowable, employing for such purpose
deposits of the Mortgagor in any escrow account which shall have been estimated
and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts sufficient for such purposes, as
allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. To the extent that a Mortgage does not
provide for escrow payments, the Servicer shall, if it has received notice of a
default or deficiency, monitor such payments to determine if they are made by
the Mortgagor.

                  Not later than 12:00 noon California time on the fourth

                                  THE SERVICER

                  Section 5.01. LIABILITY OF THE SELLER AND THE SERVICER. The
Seller and the Servicer shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the
extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the Seller
or the Servicer, as the case may be, herein.

                  Section 5.02. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF OR ASSUMPTION OF THE
OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER OR THE SERVICER. Any corporation into which the Seller
or the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting from
any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Seller or the Servicer
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of the Seller or
the Servicer, shall be the successor of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case
may be, hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

                  Section 5.03. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF THE SERVICER AND
OTHERS. Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or employees
or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Trust or the
Noteholders for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
by the Servicer in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in
judgment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer
or any such Person against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by
reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of duties of the Servicer or by reason of its reckless disregard of
its obligations and duties of the Servicer hereunder; and PROVIDED, FURTHER,
that this provision shall not be construed to entitle the Servicer to indemnity
in the event that amounts advanced by the Servicer to retire any senior lien
exceed Net Liquidation Proceeds realized with respect to the related Mortgage
Loan. The Servicer and any director or officer or employee or agent of the
Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any kind PRIMA FACIE properly
executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.
The Servicer and any director or officer or employee or agent of the Servicer
shall be indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred in connection with any legal action relating to this
Agreement or the Notes, other than any loss, liability or expense related to any
specific Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans (except as any such loss, liability or
expense shall be otherwise reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement) and any
loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of
its reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. The Servicer may in
its sole discretion undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or
desirable in respect of this Agreement, and the rights and duties of the parties
hereto and the interests of the Noteholders hereunder. In such event, the
reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action and any liability resulting
therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust and the Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor pursuant to Section 3.03(viii). The
Servicer's right to indemnity or reimbursement pursuant to this Section 5.03
shall survive any resignation or termination of the Servicer pursuant to Section
5.04 or 6.01 with respect to any losses, expenses, costs or liabilities arising
prior to such resignation or termination (or arising from events that occurred
prior to such resignation or termination).

                  Section 5.04. SERVICER NOT TO RESIGN. Subject to the
provisions of Section 5.02, the Servicer shall not resign from the obligations
and duties hereby imposed on it except (i) upon determination that the
performance of its obligations or duties hereunder are no longer permissible
under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law
with any other activities carried on by it or its subsidiaries or Affiliates,
the other activities of the Servicer so causing such a conflict being of a type
and nature carried on by the Servicer or its subsidiaries or Affiliates at the
date of this Agreement, or (ii) upon satisfaction of the following conditions:
(a) the Servicer has proposed a successor servicer to the Indenture Trustee in
writing; (b) each Rating Agency shall have delivered a letter to the Indenture
Trustee prior to the appointment of the successor servicer stating that the
proposed appointment of such successor servicer as Servicer hereunder will not
result in the reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the Class A
Notes without giving effect to the Note Insurance Policy; and (c) such proposed
successor servicer is reasonably acceptable to the Note Insurer, as evidenced by
a letter to the Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that no such resignation
by the Servicer shall become effective until such successor servicer or, in the
case of (i) above, the Indenture Trustee shall have assumed the Servicer's
responsibilities and obligations hereunder or the Indenture Trustee shall have
designated a successor servicer in accordance with Section 6.02. Any such
resignation shall not relieve the Servicer of responsibility for any of the
obligations specified in Sections, 5.07, 6.01 and 6.02 as obligations that
survive the resignation or termination of the Servicer. Any such determination
permitting the resignation of the Servicer pursuant to clause (i) above shall be
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Indenture
Trustee and the Note Insurer.

                  Section 5.05. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. In the ordinary course of
business, the Servicer at any time may delegate any of its duties hereunder to
any Person, including any of its Affiliates, who agrees to conduct such duties
in accordance with standards comparable to those set forth in Section 3.01. Such
delegation shall not relieve the Servicer of its liabilities and
responsibilities with respect to such duties and shall not constitute a
resignation within the meaning of Section 5.04. The Servicer shall provide the
Note Insurer and the Indenture Trustee with written notice prior to the
delegation of any of its duties to any Person other than any of the Servicer's
Affiliates or their respective successors and assigns.

                  Section 5.06. RESERVED.

                  Section 5.07. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SERVICER. The Servicer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee in all capacities from and against any loss, liability, expense, damage
or injury suffered or sustained by reason of the Servicer's activities or
omissions in servicing or administering the Mortgage Loans that are not in
accordance with its obligations under the Basic Documents, including, but not
limited to, any judgment, award, settlement, reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or
threatened action, proceeding or claim related to the Servicer's failure to
perform its obligations in accordance with the Basic Documents. Any such
indemnification shall not be payable from the assets of the Trust. The
provisions of this indemnity shall run directly to and be enforceable by an
injured party subject to the limitations hereof. The indemnification provided in
this Section 5.07 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
removal or resignation of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture or the Owner
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

                  The Servicer covenants and agrees to pay or reimburse, from
time to time out of the Servicing Fee or out of other funds, upon its request
for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of the Basic
Documents (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and of all persons not regularly in its employ)
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its gross
negligence or bad faith or which is the responsibility of Noteholders hereunder.
In addition, the Servicer covenants and agrees to indemnify the Indenture
Trustee in all capacities and its officers, directors, employees and agents
from, and hold it harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims or expenses (i) incurred in connection with any legal action or claims
relating to the Basic Documents or the Notes or by reason of its participation
in the transactions contemplated herein or in the Basic Documents, other than
any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence of the Indenture Trustee in the performance of its
duties hereunder or by reason of the Indenture Trustee's reckless disregard of
obligations and duties hereunder, or (ii) resulting from any error in any tax or
information return prepared by the Servicer. This section shall survive
termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of any Indenture
Trustee hereunder.

                  (a)      If any one of the following events ("Events of
Default") shall occur and be continuing:

                  (i)      (A) The failure by the Servicer to make any Monthly

         Collection Account any deposit required to be made under the terms of
         this Agreement which continues unremedied for a period of one Business
         Day after the date upon which written notice of such failure shall have
         been given to the Servicer by the Indenture Trustee or to the Servicer
         and the Indenture Trustee by the Note Insurer or to the Servicer and

                  (ii)     The failure by the Servicer to make any required
         Servicing Advance which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30
         days, or the failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform, in any
         material respect, any other covenants, obligations or agreements of the
         Servicer as set forth in this Agreement, which materially and adversely
         affects the interests of the Class A Noteholders or the Note Insurer
         and which failure continues unremedied for a period of 60 days, in each
         case, after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring
         the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the

         liquidator in any insolvency, conservatorship, receivership,
         readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar
         proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and
         the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for
         a period of 60 consecutive days; or

                  (iv)     The Servicer shall voluntarily go into liquidation,
         consent to the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator
         or similar person in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling
         of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to the

         admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they
         become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable
         insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the
         benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of its
         obligations; or

                  (v)      a Servicer Termination Delinquency Event shall have
         occurred;

                  (vi)     a Servicer Termination Loss Event shall have
         occurred; or

                  (vii)    if the total stockholders' equity of the Servicer, as
         determined by the Servicer's independent accountants on an annual basis
         in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as
         determined by the Servicer in any quarterly financial statement
         prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
         shall be less than $25 million.

                  (b)      then, and in each and every such case, so long as a
Servicer Event of Default shall not have been remedied, (x) with respect solely
to clause (i)(A) above, if such Monthly Advance is not made by 12:00 Noon New
York time on the applicable Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee, upon receipt of
written notice or actual knowledge by a Responsible Officer of such failure,
shall give immediate telephonic notice of such failure to a Servicing Officer of
the Servicer and to the Note Insurer and the Indenture Trustee shall terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement and the
Indenture Trustee as successor servicer, or a successor servicer appointed in
accordance with Section 6.02, shall immediately make such Monthly Advance and
assume, pursuant to Section 6.02 hereof, the duties of a successor Servicer; (y)
in the case of clauses (i)(B), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Indenture Trustee
shall, at the direction of the Note Insurer or the Holders of the Class A Notes
evidencing not less than 51% of the Voting Rights, and (z) in the case of
(i)(B)(v) and (vi), the Note Insurer may, in accordance with the terms of the
Insurance Agreement, by notice then given in writing to the Servicer (and to the
Indenture Trustee if given by Holders of Notes), terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer as servicer under this Agreement. Any such notice to
the Servicer shall also be given to each Rating Agency, the Depositor and the
Note Insurer. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice,
all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with
respect to the Notes or the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be
vested in the Indenture Trustee as successor servicer pursuant to and under this
Section 6.01; and, without limitation, the Indenture Trustee is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement of each Mortgage Loan and related documents, or otherwise. The
Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Indenture Trustee in effecting the
termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer hereunder,
including, without limitation, the transfer to the Indenture Trustee as
successor servicer for the administration by it of all cash amounts that shall
at the time be held by the Servicer and to be deposited by it in the Collection
Account, or that have been deposited by the Servicer in the Collection Account
or thereafter received by the Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans. All
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection
with transferring the Mortgage Files to the successor Servicer and amending this
Agreement to reflect such succession as Servicer


                                       35
<PAGE>


pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer (or if
the predecessor Servicer is the Indenture Trustee, the initial Servicer) upon
presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses. If the
Indenture Trustee is acting as successor servicer and the predecessor Servicer
fails to pay such costs and expenses, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Trust to the extent set forth in Section 3.05 of the
Indenture.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure of
performance under Section 6.01(a)(i) for a period of ten Business Days, or under
Section 6.01(a)(ii), for a period of 60 Business Days, shall not constitute a
Servicer Event of Default if such delay or failure could not be prevented by the
exercise of reasonable diligence by the Servicer and such delay or failure was
caused by an act of God or the public enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war,
public disorder, rebellion or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire,
hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall
not relieve the Servicer from using its best efforts to perform its respective
obligations in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Servicer shall provide the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and the
Noteholders with an Officers' Certificate giving prompt notice of such failure
or delay by it, together with a description of its efforts to so perform its
obligations. The Servicer shall immediately notify the Indenture Trustee in
writing of any Events of Default.

                  Section 6.02. INDENTURE TRUSTEE TO ACT; APPOINTMENT OF
SUCCESSOR.

                  (a)      On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice
of termination pursuant to Section 6.01 or 5.04, the Indenture Trustee shall be
the successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under
this Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall
be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto
placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof arising on and after
its succession. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to such compensation as the Servicer would have been entitled to
hereunder if no such notice of termination had been given. Notwithstanding the
above, (i) if the Indenture Trustee is unwilling to act as successor Servicer,
or (ii) if the Indenture Trustee is legally unable so to act, the Indenture
Trustee may (in the situation described in clause (i)) or shall (in the
situation described in clause (ii)) appoint or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint, any established housing and home finance institution,
bank or other mortgage loan or home equity loan servicer having a net worth of
not less than $25,000,000 as the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the
assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of
the Servicer hereunder; PROVIDED, that any such successor Servicer shall be
acceptable to the Note Insurer, as evidenced by the Note Insurer's prior written
consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and PROVIDED, FURTHER,
that the appointment of any such successor Servicer will not result in the
qualification, reduction or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to the Notes by
the Rating Agencies without giving effect to the Note Insurance Policy. Pending
appointment of a successor to the Servicer hereunder, unless the Indenture
Trustee is prohibited by law from so acting, the Indenture Trustee shall act in
such capacity as hereinabove provided. In connection with such appointment and
assumption, the successor shall be entitled to receive compensation out of
payments on Mortgage Loans in an amount equal to the compensation which the
Servicer would otherwise have received pursuant to Section 3.09 (or such lesser
compensation as the Indenture Trustee and such successor shall agree). The
appointment of a successor Servicer shall not affect


                                       36
<PAGE>


any liability of the predecessor Servicer which may have arisen under this
Agreement prior to its termination as Servicer to pay any deductible under an
insurance policy pursuant to Section 3.05 or to indemnify the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to Section 5.07), nor shall any successor Servicer be liable for any
acts or omissions of the predecessor Servicer or for any breach by such Servicer
of any of its representations or warranties contained herein or in any related
document or agreement. The Indenture Trustee and such successor shall take such
action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any
such succession. The Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Servicer the amount, if
any, paid by a successor servicer for the servicing rights, after payment of the
expenses of sale and amounts owed by the terminated Servicer to the Trust.

                  (b)      Any successor, including the Indenture Trustee, to
the Servicer as servicer shall during the term of its service as servicer (i)
continue to service and administer the Mortgage Loans for the benefit of
Noteholders and the Note Insurer, (ii) maintain in force a policy or policies of
insurance covering errors and omissions in the performance of its obligations as
Servicer hereunder and a fidelity bond in respect of its officers, employees and
agents to the same extent as the Servicer is so required pursuant to Section
3.06. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
Indenture Trustee be liable for any Servicing Fee or for any differential in the
amount of the Servicing Fee paid hereunder and the amount necessary to induce
any successor Servicer to act as successor Servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for herein.

                  Section 6.03. WAIVER OF DEFAULTS.

                  The Holders of the Class A Notes evidencing not less than 51%
of the Voting Rights may, on behalf of all Noteholders, and subject to the
consent of the Note Insurer, waive any events permitting removal of the Servicer
as servicer pursuant to this Article VIII; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Majority
Noteholders may not waive a default in making a required payment on a Note
without the consent of the Holder of such Note. Upon any waiver of a past
default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Event of Default
arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of
this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default
or impair any right consequent thereto except to the extent expressly so waived.
Notice of any such waiver shall be given by the Indenture Trustee to the Rating
Agencies.

                  Section 6.04. NOTIFICATION TO NOTEHOLDERS.

                  Upon any termination or appointment of a successor to the
Servicer pursuant to this Article VI or Section 5.04, the Indenture Trustee
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Noteholders at their respective
addresses appearing in the Note Register, the Note Insurer and each Rating
Agency.

                     DUTIES OF THE SERVICER AS ADMINISTRATOR

                  Section 8.01. ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES.

                  (a)      DUTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE INDENTURE. The
Administrator shall perform all its duties and the duties of the Issuer under
the Indenture. In addition, the Administrator shall consult with the Owner
Trustee as the Administrator deems appropriate regarding the duties of the
Issuer under the Indenture. The Administrator shall monitor the performance of
the Issuer and shall advise the Owner Trustee when action is necessary to comply
with the Issuer's duties under the Indenture. The Administrator shall prepare
for execution by the Issuer or shall cause the preparation by other appropriate
Persons of all such documents, reports, filings, instruments, certificates and
opinions as it shall be the duty of the Issuer to prepare, file or deliver
pursuant to the Indenture. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Administrator
shall take all necessary action that is the duty of the Issuer to take pursuant
to the Indenture.

                  (b)      DUTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUER.

                  (i)      In addition to the duties of the Administrator set
         forth in this Servicing Agreement or any of the Basic Documents, the
         Administrator shall perform such calculations and shall prepare for
         execution by the Issuer or the Owner Trustee or shall cause the
         preparation by other appropriate Persons of all such documents,
         reports, filings, instruments, certificates and opinions as it shall be
         the duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to prepare, file or deliver
         pursuant to this Servicing Agreement or any of the Basic Documents or
         under state and federal tax and securities laws (including, but not
         limited to, UCC filings in applicable jurisdictions and annual
         compliance certificates, if any), and at the request of the Owner
         Trustee or the Indenture Trustee shall take all appropriate action that
         it is the duty of the Issuer to take pursuant to this Servicing
         Agreement or any of the Basic Documents. In accordance with the
         directions of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee, the Administrator shall
         administer, perform or supervise the performance of such other
         activities in connection with the Notes (including the Basic Documents)
         as are not covered by any of the foregoing provisions and as are
         expressly requested by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
         Trustee.

                  (ii)     Notwithstanding anything in this Servicing Agreement
         or any of the Basic Documents to the contrary, the Administrator shall
         be responsible for promptly notifying the Owner Trustee and Certificate
         Paying Agent in the event that any withholding tax is imposed on the
         Issuer's payments (or allocations of income) to an Owner (as defined in
         the Trust Agreement) as contemplated in Section 5.03 of the Trust
         Agreement. Any such notice shall be in writing and specify the amount
         of any withholding tax required to be withheld by the Owner Trustee or
         the Certificate Paying Agent pursuant to such provision.

                  (iii)    In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its
         other obligations under this Servicing Agreement, the Administrator may
         enter into transactions with or


                                       41
<PAGE>


         otherwise deal with any of its Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
         terms of any such transactions or dealings shall be in accordance with
         any directions received from the Issuer and shall be, in the
         Administrator's opinion, no less favorable to the Issuer in any
         material respect than with terms made available to unrelated third
         parties.

                  (c)      TAX MATTERS. The Administrator shall prepare, on
behalf of the Owner Trustee, financial statements and such annual or other
reports of the Issuer as are necessary for the preparation by the Indenture
Trustee of tax returns and information reports as provided in Section 5.03 of
the Trust Agreement, including, without limitation, Form 1099.

                  (d)      NON-MINISTERIAL MATTERS. With respect to matters that
in the reasonable judgment of the Administrator are non-ministerial, the
Administrator shall not take any action pursuant to this Article VIII unless
within a reasonable time before the taking of such action, the Administrator
shall have notified the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of the proposed
action and the Owner Trustee and, with respect to items (A), (B), (C) and (D)
below, the Indenture Trustee shall not have withheld consent or provided an
alternative direction. For the purpose of the preceding sentence,
"non-ministerial matters" shall include:

                           (A)      the amendment of or any supplement to the
                  Indenture;

                           (B)      the initiation of any claim or lawsuit by

                  brought by or against the Issuer (other than in connection
                  with the collection of the Mortgage Loans);

                  which the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as
                  applicable, is a party;

                           (D)      the appointment of successor Certificate
                  Paying Agents and successor Indenture Trustees pursuant to the
                  Indenture or the appointment of successor Servicers or the
                  consent to the assignment by the Certificate Registrar, Paying
                  Agent or Indenture Trustee of its obligations under the
                  Indenture; and

                           (E)      the removal of the Indenture Trustee.

                  (e)      SERVICER SHALL ACT AS ADMINISTRATOR. By execution of
this Agreement, the Servicer agrees to be bound as Administrator and shall
perform the obligations of the Administrator as described herein.

                  Section 8.02. RECORDS. The Administrator shall maintain
appropriate books of account and records relating to services performed under
this Servicing Agreement, which books of account and records shall be accessible
for inspection by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee at any

                  1.       I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K, and

respect of periods included in the year covered by this annual report, of Home
Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2, Asset Backed Notes, Series 2004-2;

                  2.       Based on my knowledge, the information in these
reports, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
as of the last day of the period covered by this annual report;

                  3.       Based on my knowledge, the distribution or servicing
information required to be provided to the trustee by the servicer under the
pooling and servicing, or similar, agreement, for inclusion in these reports is
included in these reports;

                  4.       Based on my knowledge and upon the annual compliance
statement included in the report and required to be delivered to the trustee in
accordance with the terms of the pooling and servicing, or similar, agreement,
and except as disclosed in the reports, the servicer has fulfilled its
obligations under the servicing agreement; and

                  5.       The reports disclose all significant deficiencies
relating to the servicer's compliance with the minimum servicing standards based
upon the report provided by an independent public accountant, after conducting a
review in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage

similar, agreement, that is included in these reports.

                                   DEFINITIONS

                                   ARTICLE II

                SALE OF MORTGAGE LOANS; PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE

         Section 2.1 SALE OF INITIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. The Seller, concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, does hereby sell, assign, set

title and interest in, to and under the following, whether now existing or

including the related Cut-Off Date Principal Balance; (ii) payments in respect

(iii) property which secured any Initial Mortgage Loan and which has been

         Section 2.2 SALE OF SUBSEQUENT MORTGAGE LOANS. (A) The Seller covenants
and agrees to use its best efforts to acquire and sell to the Issuer as assignee

                                       2
<PAGE>

         (B) The Seller shall comply with its obligations set forth in
Sections 2.3, 3.1 and 3.2 with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans
delivered on each Subsequent Transfer Date. References in such Sections to the
Initial Mortgage Loans or Mortgage Loans shall be deemed to refer to the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans and references to the Cut-Off Date or the Closing
Date, as applicable, shall be deemed to refer to the applicable related Cut-Off
Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, respectively, except that references to 360
days after the Closing Date shall remain unchanged as shall representations made
with specific reference to the Initial Mortgage Loans.

         Section 2.3 OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER UPON SALE. In connection with the
transfer pursuant to Sections 2.1 or 2.2 hereof, the Seller further agrees, at
its own expense, on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the Initial
Mortgage Loans and on or prior to the related Subsequent Transfer Date with
respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans (a) to indicate in its books and
records that the Mortgage Loans have been sold to the Trust, and (b) to deliver
to the Purchaser and the Indenture Trustee a computer file containing a true and
complete list of all such Mortgage Loans specifying for each such Mortgage Loan,
as of the Cut-Off Date, (i) its account number and (ii) the Cut-Off Date
Principal Balance. Such file, which forms a part of Exhibit B to the Indenture,
shall also be marked as Schedule I to this Agreement and is hereby incorporated
into and made a part of this Agreement.

         In connection with any conveyance by the Seller, the Seller shall on
behalf of the Purchaser deliver to and deposit with the Indenture Trustee, as
assignee of the Purchaser, on or before the Closing Date or Subsequent Transfer
Date, as applicable (or such later date as permitted herein) the following
documents or instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (the "Related
Documents"):

                  (a) The original Mortgage Note, with all prior and intervening
endorsements showing a complete chain of endorsements from the originator of the
Mortgage Loan to the Person so endorsing the Mortgage Loan to the Indenture
Trustee, endorsed by such Person "Pay to the order of Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee for Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2,
Asset Backed Notes, Series 2004-2 without recourse" and signed, by facsimile or
manual signature, in the name of the Seller by a Responsible Officer of the
Seller;

                  (b) Any of: (i) the original Mortgage and related power of
attorney, if any, with evidence of recording thereon, (ii) a copy of the
Mortgage and related power of attorney, if any, certified as a true copy of the
original Mortgage or power of attorney by a Responsible Officer of the Seller
and otherwise complying with the provisions of the next following paragraph, or
by the closing attorney by facsimile or manual signature, or by an officer of
the title insurer or agent of the title insurer that issued the related title
insurance policy if the original has been transmitted for recording until such
time as the original is returned by the public recording office, or (iii) a copy
of the Mortgage and related power of attorney, if any, certified by the public
recording office;

                  (c) The original Assignment of Mortgage in recordable form,
from the Seller to "Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee
for Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2". Any such Assignments of Mortgage may
be made by blanket assignments


                                       3
<PAGE>

for Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties located in the same
county, if permitted by applicable law;

                  (d) The original lender's policy of title insurance or a true
copy thereof, or if such original lender's title insurance policy has been lost,
a copy thereof certified by the appropriate title insurer to be true and
complete, or if such lender's title insurance policy has not been issued as of
the Closing Date, a marked-up commitment (binder) to issue such policy;

                  (e) All intervening assignments, if any, showing a complete
chain of assignments from the originator to the Seller, including any recorded
warehousing assignments, with evidence of recording thereon, certified by a
Responsible Officer of the Seller by facsimile or manual signature as a true
copy of the original of such intervening assignments; and

                  (f) Originals of all assumption, written assurance,
substitution and modification agreements, if any.

         In instances where the original recorded Mortgage cannot be delivered
by the Seller to the Indenture Trustee prior to or concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Subsequent Transfer Agreement,
as applicable, as contemplated by clause (b)(ii) above, due to a delay in
connection with recording, the Seller may in lieu of delivering such original
recorded Mortgage, deliver prior to or concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement or the Subsequent Transfer Agreement, as applicable, to the Indenture
Trustee a copy thereof, provided that the Seller certifies that the original
Mortgage has been delivered to a title insurance company for recordation after
receipt of its policy of title insurance or binder therefor. In all such
instances, the Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered the original
recorded Mortgage to the Indenture Trustee, as assignee of the Purchaser,
promptly upon receipt thereof but in no event later than one year after the
Closing Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable.

         The Seller hereby confirms to the Purchaser that, as of the Closing
Date, it has caused the portions of the Electronic Ledger relating to the
Initial Mortgage Loans maintained by the Seller to be clearly and unambiguously
marked to indicate that the Initial Mortgage Loans have been sold to the Trust.

         The Purchaser hereby acknowledges its acceptance of all right, title
and interest to the Initial Mortgage Loans and other property, now existing and
hereafter created, conveyed to it pursuant to Section 2.1.

         It is intended that the conveyance of the Seller's right, title and
interest in and to the Initial Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement shall
constitute, and shall be construed as, a sale of such property and not a grant
of a security interest to secure a loan. However, if such conveyance is deemed
to be in respect of a loan, it is intended that: (1) the rights and obligations
of the Seller and the Purchaser shall be established pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement; (2) the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser a first priority
security interest to secure repayment of an obligation in an amount equal to the
aggregate principal balance of the Initial Mortgage Loans in all of the Seller's
right, title and interest in, to and under, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, the Initial Mortgage Loans and the property described above and all
proceeds of any and all such property whether now existing or hereafter created
to secure such obligation; and (3)


                                       4
<PAGE>

this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law. If
such conveyance is deemed to be in respect of a loan and the Trust created by
the Indenture terminates prior to the satisfaction of the claims of the
Purchaser, the security interest created hereby shall continue in full force and
effect and the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be the collateral agent for
the benefit of the Purchaser, and all proceeds shall be distributed as herein
provided.

         Section 2.4 PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE MORTGAGE LOANS. (a) In
consideration of the sale of the Initial Mortgage Loans from the Seller to the
Purchaser on the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees to pay to the Seller on the
Closing Date by transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
$89,685,000 (the "Purchase Price"), net of an expense reimbursement amount of
$35,127.77 (the "Expense Reimbursement Amount") and to transfer to the Seller on
the Closing Date the Owner Trust Certificates. The Expense Reimbursement Amount
represents reimbursement to the Purchaser for the Purchaser's Securities and
Exchange Commission registration statement fees, the Purchaser's registration
statement administration fees allocable to the Trust and diligence fees incurred
in connection with the Prospectus and the related Prospectus Supplement. The
Seller shall pay, and be billed directly for, all expenses incurred by the
Purchaser in connection with the issuance of the Notes, including, without
limitation, printing fees, blue sky registration fees and expenses, fees and
expenses of the Note Insurer and its counsel, fees and expenses of Purchaser's
counsel, fees of the rating agencies requested to rate the Notes, accountant's
fees and expenses, Custodian fee, Corridor Contract Counterparty fees and the
fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee and other out-of-pocket costs, if
any. If the Purchaser shall determine that the Expense Reimbursement Amount is
not sufficient to reimburse the Purchaser for all expenses incurred by it that
are subject to reimbursement by the Seller hereunder as described above, the
Seller shall promptly reimburse the Purchaser for such additional amounts upon
notice by the Purchaser to the Seller.

                  (b) In consideration of the sale of the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans from the Seller to the Issuer as assignee of the Purchaser on each
Subsequent Transfer Date, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller on each
Subsequent Transfer Date by transfer of immediately available funds an amount
equal to 100% if the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans transferred or such other amount determined in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture (either such amount, the "Subsequent Purchase Price").

                  (c) Within 60 days of the Closing Date or Subsequent Transfer
Date, as applicable, the Seller, at its own expense, shall either (i) prepare
and send for recording the Assignments of Mortgage in favor of the Indenture
Trustee as pledgee of the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture (which may be a
blanket assignment if permitted by applicable law) in the appropriate real
property or other records, or (ii) deliver to the Indenture Trustee the
Assignments of Mortgage in favor of the Indenture Trustee in form for
recordation. With respect to any Assignment of Mortgage as to which the related
recording information is unavailable within 60 days following the Closing Date
or Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable, such Assignment of Mortgage shall be
submitted for recording within 30 days after receipt of such information, but in
no event later than one year from the date such Assignment of Mortgage is
otherwise required to be recorded pursuant to this Section 2.4(c). The Indenture
Trustee shall be required to retain a copy of each Assignment of Mortgage
submitted for recording. In the event that any such Assignment of Mortgage is
lost or returned unrecorded because of a defect therein, the Seller shall
promptly prepare a substitute Assignment of Mortgage or cure such defect, as the


                                       5
<PAGE>

case may be, and shall be required to submit each such Assignment of Mortgage
for recording. Any failure of the Seller to comply with this Section, or the
discovery of any defect (as contemplated by the Trust Agreement) in any
documents delivered pursuant to this Section, shall result in the obligation of
the Seller to repurchase or substitute an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan for
the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, for administrative convenience and
facilitation of servicing and to reduce closing costs, the Assignments of
Mortgage will not be required to be submitted for recording (except with respect
to any Mortgage Loan located in Maryland) unless such failure to record would
result in a withdrawal or a downgrading by any Rating Agency of the rating on
the Notes, without regard to the Note Insurance Policy; provided further,
however, each Assignment of Mortgage shall be submitted for recording by the
Servicer, in its capacity as Seller, in the manner described above, at no
expense to the Trust or the Indenture Trustee, upon the earliest to occur of:
(i) reasonable direction by the Note Insurer, or by the Holders of Notes
entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights, (ii) the occurrence of a Servicer
Termination Loss Event, (iii) the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
foreclosure relating to the Seller, (iv) the occurrence of a servicing transfer
as described in Section 5.02 of the Servicing Agreement, (v) if the Seller is
not the Servicer and (vi) with respect to any one Assignment of Mortgage, the
occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or foreclosure relating to the Mortgagor
under the related Mortgage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Servicer is
unable to pay the cost of recording the Assignments of Mortgage, such expense
shall be paid by the Indenture Trustee and shall be reimbursable to the
Indenture Trustee as a Trust expense.

                                  ARTICLE III

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; REMEDIES FOR BREACH

         Section 3.1 SELLER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS TO THE MORTGAGE
LOANS. The Seller represents and warrants to the Purchaser as of the Cut-Off
Date with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans and as of the related date
specified in each Subsequent Transfer Agreement with respect to the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans (or such other date specified):

                  (i) The information with respect to each Mortgage Loan set
         forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule is true and correct in all material
         respects as of the related Cut-Off Date;

                  (ii) All of the Related Documents set forth in Section 2.3
         have been or will be delivered to the Indenture Trustee as required by
         this Agreement;

                  (iii) Each Mortgaged Property is improved by a one- to
         five-family Residential Dwelling, which, to the best of the Seller's
         knowledge, does not include cooperatives or (other than with respect to
         4 Initial Mortgage Loans representing 0.40% of the Cut-Off Date Pool
         Principal Balance for which the related Mortgaged Property is attached
         to real estate) manufactured homes and does not constitute anything
         other than real property under state law;

                  (iv) Each Mortgage Loan is being serviced by the Servicer;

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (v) Each Mortgage Loan has an original term to maturity from
         the date on which the first Monthly Payment is due of not more than 30
         years;

                  (vi) 90.06% of the Initial Mortgage Loans by Cut-Off Date Pool
         Principal Balance have Mortgage Notes that provide for Monthly Payments
         that will adjust semi-annually (other than during the first two or
         three years following origination) with changes to the related Loan
         Rate, which, if timely paid, are sufficient to fully amortize the
         principal balance of such Mortgage Note on or before its maturity date
         and to pay interest at the applicable Loan Rate from time to time in
         effect;

                  (vii) Each Mortgage is a valid and subsisting first or second
         lien of record on the Mortgaged Property subject, in the case of any
         second Mortgage Loan, only to a First Lien on such Mortgaged Property
         and subject in all cases to the exceptions to title set forth in the
         title insurance policy with respect to the related Mortgage Loan, which
         exceptions are generally acceptable to second mortgage lending
         companies, and such other exceptions to which similar properties are
         commonly subject and which do not individually, or in the aggregate,
         materially and adversely affect the benefits of the security intended
         to be provided by such Mortgage. Any security agreement, chattel
         mortgage or equivalent document related to the Mortgage and delivered
         to the Indenture Trustee establishes in the Seller a valid and
         subsisting lien on the property described therein, and the Seller has
         full right to assign the same to the Indenture Trustee;

                  (viii) Except with respect to liens released immediately prior
         to the transfer herein contemplated, each Mortgage Note and related
         Mortgage have not been assigned or pledged and immediately prior to the
         transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the Seller held good,
         marketable and indefeasible title to, and was the sole owner and holder
         of, each Mortgage Loan subject to no liens, charges, mortgages, claims,
         participation interests, equities, pledges or security interests of any
         nature, encumbrances or rights of others (collectively, a "Lien"); the
         Seller has full right and authority under all governmental and
         regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over the Seller, subject to no
         interest or participation of, or agreement with, any party, to sell and
         assign the same pursuant to this Agreement; and immediately upon the
         transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the Depositor will hold
         good, marketable and indefeasible title, to, and be the sole owner of,
         each Mortgage Loan subject to no Liens;

                  (ix) No Mortgage Loan was 30 or more days delinquent as of the
         related Cut-Off Date and no Mortgage Loan has been 30 or more days
         delinquent more than twice during the twelve months prior to the
         related Cut-Off Date;

                  (xi) No Mortgage Loan is subject to any right of rescission,
         set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, nor

         Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the
         Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable in whole or in part, or

         Mortgaged Property which is or may be a lien prior to, or equal or
         coordinate with, the lien of the related Mortgage, and no rights are
         outstanding that under law could give rise to such a lien except those
         which are insured against by the title insurance policy referred to in
         Section 3.1 (xiv) below;

         Mortgage Loan insuring the mortgagee's interest under the related
         Mortgage Loan as the holder of a valid first or second mortgage lien of
         record on the real property described in the Mortgage, subject only to

         3.05 of the Servicing Agreement;

                  (xvii) Each Mortgage and Mortgage Note is the legal, valid and
         binding obligation of the related Mortgagor and is enforceable in
         accordance with its terms, except only as such enforcement may be
         limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
         and by general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding
         or action in equity or at law), and all parties to each Mortgage Loan
         and the Mortgagee had full legal capacity to execute all Mortgage Loan
         documents and to convey the estate therein purported to be conveyed;

                  (xviii) The Seller has directed the Servicer to perform any
         and all acts required to be performed to preserve the rights and
         remedies of the Indenture Trustee in any insurance policies applicable
         to the Mortgage Loans including, without limitation, any necessary
         notifications of insurers, assignments of policies or interests
         therein, and the establishment of co-insured, joint loss payee and
         mortgagee rights in favor of the Indenture Trustee;

                  (xix) The terms of the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have not

         being recorded, if necessary, to protect the interests of the
         Noteholders and the Note Insurer and which has been or will be
         delivered to the Indenture Trustee. The substance of any such
         alteration or modification is reflected on the Mortgage Loan Schedule
         and was approved, if required, by the related primary mortgage guaranty
         insurer, if any. Each original Mortgage was recorded, and all
         subsequent assignments of the original Mortgage have been recorded in
         the appropriate jurisdictions wherein such recordation is necessary to
         perfect the lien thereof as against creditors of the Seller, or, are in

         an amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid
         and which has been assessed but is not yet due and payable. Except for
         payments in the nature of escrow payments, including without
         limitation, taxes and insurance payments, the Seller has not advanced
         funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds
         by a party other than the Mortgagor, directly or indirectly, for the
         payment of any amount required by the Mortgage Note, except for
         interest accruing from the date of the Mortgage Note or date of
         disbursement of the Mortgage proceeds, whichever is later, to the day
         which precedes by one month the Due Date of the first installment of
         principal and interest;

                  (xxii) There is no proceeding pending or, to the best of the
         Seller's knowledge, threatened for the total or partial condemnation of
         any Mortgaged Property, nor is such a proceeding currently occurring,
         and such property is undamaged by waste, fire, earthquake or earth
         movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other casualty, so as to affect
         adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property as security for the
         Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises were intended;

                  (xxiii) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, all of the
         improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the
         appraised value of the Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the
         boundaries and building restriction lines of such property, and no
         improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged
         Property;

<PAGE>

                  (xxiv) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no improvement
         located on or being part of the Mortgaged Property is in violation of
         any applicable zoning law or regulation. To the best of the Seller's
         knowledge, all inspections, licenses and certificates required to be
         made or issued with respect to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged
         Property and, with respect to the use and occupancy of the same,
         including but not limited to certificates of occupancy and fire
         underwriting certificates, have been made or obtained from the
         appropriate authorities and the Mortgaged Property is lawfully occupied
         under applicable law;

                  (xxv) The proceeds of each Mortgage Loan have been fully
         disbursed, and there is no obligation on the part of the mortgagee to
         make future advances thereunder. Any and all requirements as to
         completion of any on-site or off-site improvements and as to
         disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All
         costs, fees and expenses incurred in making, closing or recording the
         Mortgage Loans were paid;

                  (xxvi) Each Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by
         any collateral, pledged account or other security except the lien of
         the corresponding Mortgage;

                  (xxvii) No Mortgage Loan was originated under a buydown plan;

                  (xxviii) There is no obligation on the part of the Seller or
         any other party to make payments in addition to those made by the
         Mortgagor;

                  (xxix) With respect to each Mortgage constituting a deed of
         trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such,
         has been properly designated and currently so serves and is named in
         such Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by
         the Noteholders to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in
         connection with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor;

                  (xxx) No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, or
         other contingent interest feature;

                  (xxxi) The related First Lien, if any, requires equal monthly
         payments, unless such First Lien is a graduated payment mortgage loan
         or a balloon loan, or if it bears an adjustable interest rate, the
         monthly payments for the related First Lien may be adjusted no more
         frequently than monthly;

                  (xxxii) Either (A) no consent for the Mortgage Loan is
         required by the holder of the related First Lien or (B) such consent
         has been obtained and is contained in the Mortgage File;

                  (xxxiii) The maturity date of the Mortgage Loan is prior to
         the maturity date of the related First Lien, if any, if such First Lien
         provides for a balloon payment, except if the Combined Loan-to-Value
         Ratio does not exceed 65%. No Mortgage Loan is a blanket loan; and no
         Mortgage Loan provides for negative amortization;

                  (xxxiv) All parties which have had any interest in the
         Mortgage Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise,
         are (or, during the period in which they held



                                       10

         and disposed of such interest, were) (A)(1) in compliance with any and

         federal savings and loan associations or national banks having

         state so as to require qualification or licensing;

                  (xxxv) The Mortgage contains a customary provision for the
         acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the
         Mortgage Loan in the event the related security for the Mortgage Loan
         is sold without the prior consent of the mortgagee thereunder;

                  (xxxvi) Any future advances made prior to the Cut-Off Date
         have been consolidated with the outstanding principal amount secured by
         the Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated, bears
         a single interest rate and single repayment term reflected on the
         Mortgage Loan Schedule. The consolidated principal amount does not
         exceed the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage
         Note does not permit or obligate the Seller to make future advances to
         the Mortgagor at the option of the Mortgagor;

                  (xxxvii) The Mortgage contains customary and enforceable
         provisions which render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
         adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of the
         benefits of the security, including, (1) in the case of a Mortgage
         designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (2) otherwise by
         judicial or non-judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other
         exemption available to the Mortgagor which would materially interfere
         with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or
         the right to foreclose the Mortgage except as set forth in the
         Prospectus;

                  (xxxviii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1 (ix) above, there
         is no default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing
         under any Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note and no event which,
         with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace
         or cure period, would constitute a default, breach, violation or event
         of acceleration; and the Seller has not waived any default, breach,
         violation or event of acceleration;

                  (xxxix) All parties to the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage had
         legal capacity to execute the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and each
         Mortgage Note and Mortgage have been duly and properly executed by such

                  (xl) All amounts received after the Cut-Off Date with respect

         make this Agreement valid, binding and enforceable upon the Seller in
         accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
         bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
         moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors'
         rights generally or by the application of general equitable principles
         in any proceeding, whether at law or in equity;

                  (ii) All actions, approvals, consents, waivers, exemptions,
         variances, franchises, orders, permits, authorizations, rights and
         licenses required to be taken, given or obtained, as the case may be,
         by or from any federal, state or other governmental authority or agency
         that are necessary in connection with the purchase and sale of the
         Mortgage Loans and the execution and delivery by the Seller of the
         documents relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

         review thereof may be obtained has expired or no review thereof may be
         obtained or appeal therefrom taken, and are adequate to authorize the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
         other documents on the part of the Seller and the performance by the
         Seller of its obligations as seller under this Agreement and such of
         the other documents to which it is a party;

                  (iii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement will not result in the breach of any terms or provisions
         of the charter or bylaws of the Seller or result in the breach of any
         term or provision of, or conflict with or constitute a default under or
         result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any material
         agreement, indenture, contract or loan or credit agreement or other
         material instrument to which the Seller or its property is subject, or
         result in the violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment
         or decree to which the Seller or its property is subject;

                  (iv) Neither this Agreement nor any statement, report or other
         document prepared by the Seller and furnished or to be furnished
         pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby, contains any untrue statement of material fact or
         omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
         contained herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under
         which they were made, not misleading;

                  (v) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation
         pending or, to the best of the knowledge of the Seller, threatened,
         before any court, administrative agency or tribunal against the Seller
         which, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in
         any material adverse change in the business, operations, financial
         condition, properties or assets of the Seller or in any material
         prohibition or impairment of the right or ability of the Seller to
         carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any
         material liability on the part of the Seller, or which would draw into
         question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the
         Mortgage Loans or of any action taken or to be taken in connection with
         the obligations of the Seller contemplated herein, or which would be
         likely to impair materially the ability of the Seller to perform under
         the terms of this Agreement, or that might prohibit its entering into
         this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
         contemplated hereby;

                  (vi) The Seller is not in violation of or in default with
         respect to, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
         Seller and its performance of and compliance with the terms hereof will
         not constitute a violation or default with respect to, any order or
         decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any federal,
         state, municipal or governmental agency, which violation or default
         might have consequences that would materially and adversely affect the
         condition (financial or other) or operations of the Seller or its
         properties, or might have consequences that would materially and
         adversely affect its performance hereunder or under any Subservicing
         Agreement;

                  (vii) With respect to any Mortgage Loan purchased by the
         Seller, the Seller acquired title to the Mortgage Loan in good faith,
         without notice of any adverse claim; and

                                       15
<PAGE>

                  (viii) The Seller is an approved seller/servicer of
         conventional first and second mortgage loans for Fannie Mae, in good
         standing, and an approved seller/servicer of conventional second
         mortgage loans for Freddie Mac, in good standing, and the Servicer's
         deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by
         law.

         With respect to the representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 3.2 that are made to the best of the Seller's knowledge or as to which
the Seller has no knowledge, if it is discovered by the Purchaser, the Seller,
the Servicer or a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee that the
substance of such representation and warranty is inaccurate and such inaccuracy
materially and adversely affects the value of the related Mortgage Loan, then,
notwithstanding the Seller's lack of knowledge with respect to the substance of
such representation and warranty being inaccurate at the time the representation
or warranty was made, such inaccuracy shall be deemed a breach of the applicable
representation or warranty. With respect to any breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in this Section 3.2, the Seller shall cure, repurchase or
substitute in accordance with the Servicing Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

except for the transfer hereunder, the Seller will not sell, pledge, assign or
transfer to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist
any Lien on any Mortgage Loan, or any interest therein; the Seller will notify
the Indenture Trustee, as assignee of the Purchaser, of the existence of any
Lien on any Mortgage Loan immediately upon discovery thereof; and the Seller
will defend the right, title and interest of the Trust, as assignee of the
Purchaser, in, to and under the Mortgage Loans, against all claims of third
parties claiming through or under the Seller.

                  (b) So long as the Seller is the Servicer, then the Seller in
its capacity as Servicer will execute any certification that may be legally
required in connection with any filings that may be made under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 by or on behalf of Home Loan Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-2
provided (a) such certifications are similar in scope to the certification
required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the Closing Date and
(b) the liability for failure to comply with such certification requirement is
no more onerous than the liability associated with a failure to comply with the
certification requirement of Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

                                    ARTICLE V

                          INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLER
                       WITH RESPECT TO THE MORTGAGE LOANS

         Section 6.1 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Seller agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser, each of its directors, each of its officers who
have signed the Registration Statement, and each of its directors and each
person or entity who controls the Purchaser or any such person, within the
meaning of Section 15 of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint and several, to which the Purchaser, or any such person or
entity may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, and will
reimburse the Purchaser and each such controlling person for any legal or other
expenses incurred by the Purchaser or such controlling person in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claims, damages or liabilities insofar
as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of any material fact contained in the Prospectus Supplement or any amendment or
supplement to the Prospectus Supplement approved in writing by the Seller, or
the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements in the Prospectus Supplement or any amendment or
supplement to the Prospectus Supplement approved in writing by the Seller, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but
only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission (i) relates to the information contained in the
Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Summary-The Mortgage Loans", "Home
Loan and Investment Bank, F.S.B.", "Description of the Mortgage Loans", the
third and fourth sentences in the first paragraph under the caption "Prepayment

caption "Risk Factors-Priority of Liens", the third paragraph under the caption
"Risk Factors-Interest Payments on the Mortgage Loans and Resulting Reductions
in Interest and Distributions on the Class A Notes", the first, second and third
sentences under the caption "Risk Factors-Certain Mortgage Loans Have High

under the caption "Risk Factors-Recently Originated Loans More Likely to
Experience Early Defaults", the second paragraph and table under the caption
"Risk Factors-Geographic Concentration May Affect Performance", the third and

alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the information on
any computer tape furnished to the Purchaser or any affiliate thereof by or on
behalf of the Seller containing information regarding the assets of the Trust

to any liability which the Seller may otherwise have to the Purchaser, or any
affiliate thereof, concerning the assets of the Trust.


                                       17
<PAGE>

                  (b) The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller and each person who controls the Seller within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint and several, to which the Seller, or any such person or
entity may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, and will
reimburse the Seller for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Seller or
such person in connection with investigating or defending any such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
the Prospectus Supplement, or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus
Supplement, or the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements in the Prospectus Supplement or
any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus Supplement, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only to the extent
that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission relates to the information contained in the Prospectus Supplement,
other than the Seller Information and except to the extent that any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is the
direct result of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement contained in
the Seller Collateral Information. This indemnity agreement will be in addition
to any liability which the Purchaser may otherwise have.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under this
Article VI of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any
indemnifying party under this Article VI, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that
the failure to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Article VI, except to the extent that it
has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the
failure to notify any indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Article VI.

         If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Article VI for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation.

         Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party
unless: (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the
indemnifying party in writing; (ii) such indemnified party shall have been
advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to it which are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is
advisable for such indemnified party to employ separate counsel; or (iii) the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ


                                       18
<PAGE>

counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action
on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate
but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in
addition to local counsel), at any time, for all such indemnified parties, which
firm shall be designated in writing by the Purchaser, if the indemnified parties
under this Article VI consist of the Purchaser, or by the Seller, if the
indemnified parties under this Article VI consist of the Seller.

         Each indemnified party, as a condition of the indemnity agreements
contained in Section 6.1(a) and (b) herein, shall use its best efforts to
cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such action or
claim. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such
action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there is a
final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any
loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified
party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified
party for fees and expenses of counsel, for which indemnification is required
pursuant to this Article VI, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be
liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent
if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such
indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, and (ii) such indemnifying party
shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request
prior to the date of such settlement.

         (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Article is,
for any reason, held to be unenforceable, although applicable in accordance with
its terms, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other, shall
contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of
the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Seller and
the Purchaser in such proportions as shall be appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Seller on the one hand and the Purchaser on
the other from the sale of the Mortgage Loans such that the Purchaser is
responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the difference
between the Purchase Price paid to the Seller and the proceeds received by the
Depositor from the sale of the Class A Notes, bears to the Purchase Price and
the Seller shall be responsible for the balance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this
Section, each person, if any, who controls the Purchaser within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
the Purchaser, and each director of the Seller, each officer of the Seller, and
each person, if any, who controls the Seller within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Seller.
Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (d) to the contrary, the


                                       19
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall not be required to contribute an amount in excess of the amount
of the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus
Supplement.

         (e) The Seller agrees to indemnify and to hold, with respect to (e)(i)
below, each of the Purchaser, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and each
Noteholder, and with respect to (e)(ii) below, the Purchaser only, harmless
against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees
and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the
Purchaser, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer and any Noteholder, as the
case may be, may sustain in any way (i) related to the failure of the Seller to
perform its duties in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii)
arising from a breach by the Seller of its representations and warranties in
Section 3.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
indemnification shall not be available for any economic losses of the indemnitee
due to reinvestment losses, loss of investment income or any other special,
punitive, indirect or consequential losses or damages (other than (a) reasonable
legal fees and expenses and other out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Purchaser
or such indemnitee, and (b) to the extent such losses or damages are components
of claims against, or of penalties, fines, forfeitures or judgments imposed on,
the Purchaser or such indemnitee, in each case resulting from any breach by the
Seller of a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement). The Seller
shall immediately notify the Purchaser, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Insurer
and each Noteholder if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this
Agreement. The Seller shall assume the defense of any such claim and pay all
expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable counsel fees, and
promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered
against the Purchaser, the Servicer, the Seller, the Indenture Trustee, the Note
Insurer and/or Noteholder in respect of such claim. Pursuant to the Servicing
Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall reimburse the Seller in accordance with
Section 5.03 of the Servicing Agreement for all amounts advanced by the Seller
pursuant to the preceding sentence except when the claim relates directly to the
failure of the Seller to perform its duties in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement.

         Section 6.2 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF THE SELLER. None of the
directors or trustees or officers or employees or agents of the Seller shall be
under any liability to the Purchaser, it being expressly understood that all
such liability is expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as
consideration for, the execution of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this
provision shall not protect any such Person against any liability which would
otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of duties hereunder. Except as expressly provided
in the Trust Agreement, the Seller shall not be under any liability to the
Trust, the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders. The Seller and any director or
officer or employee or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on any
document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person
respecting any matters arising hereunder.

         Section 8.4 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any one or more of the

or terms shall be deemed severable


                                       21
<PAGE>

from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement
and shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement.

         Section 8.5 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which, when so executed, shall be deemed to be an original and such
counterparts, together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 8.6 FURTHER AGREEMENTS. The Purchaser and the Seller each agree
to execute and deliver to the other such additional documents, instruments or
agreements as may be necessary or reasonable and appropriate to effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement, or in connection with the issuance of any Series of
Notes representing interests in the Mortgage Loans.

         Section 8.7 INTENTION OF THE PARTIES. It is the intention of the
parties that the Purchaser is purchasing, and the Seller is selling, the
Mortgage Loans rather than pledging the Mortgage Loans to secure a loan by the
Purchaser to the Seller. Accordingly, the parties hereto each intend to treat
the transaction for Federal income tax purposes and all other purposes as a sale
by the Seller, and a purchase by the Purchaser, of the Mortgage Loans. The
Purchaser will have the right to review the Mortgage Loans and the related
Mortgage Loan Files to determine the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans which
will affect the Federal income tax consequences of owning the Mortgage Loans and
the Seller will cooperate with all reasonable requests made by the Purchaser in
the course of such review.

         Section 8.8 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; ASSIGNMENT OF PURCHASE AGREEMENT.
This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Seller, the Purchaser, the Indenture Trustee and the Note Insurer. The
obligations of the Seller under this Agreement cannot be assigned or delegated
to a third party without the consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall be at
the Purchaser's sole discretion, except that the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that the Seller may assign its obligations hereunder to any Person into
which the Seller is merged or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Seller is a party or any Person
succeeding to the business of the Seller. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the Purchaser is acquiring the Mortgage Loans for the purpose of transferring
them to a trust that will issue a Series of Notes representing undivided
interests in such Mortgage Loans. As an inducement to the Purchaser to purchase
the Mortgage Loans, the Seller acknowledges and consents to the assignment by
the Purchaser to the Indenture Trustee of all of the Purchaser's rights against
the Seller pursuant to this Agreement (other than any rights of the Purchaser to
indemnification under Sections 6.1(a), (c), (d) and (e)(ii) herein) insofar as
such rights relate to Mortgage Loans pledged to such Indenture Trustee and to
the enforcement or exercise of any right or remedy against the Seller pursuant
to this Agreement by the Indenture Trustee or the Note Insurer under the
Servicing Agreement. Such enforcement of a right or remedy by the Indenture
Trustee or the Note Insurer shall have the same force and effect as if the right
