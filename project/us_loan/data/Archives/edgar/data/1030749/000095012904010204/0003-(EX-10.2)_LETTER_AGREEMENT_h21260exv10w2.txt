            GulfMark Offshore, Inc. (the "GUARANTOR") (3) Nordea Bank Norge ASA
            ("NORDEA") and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ("RBS") (the
            "ARRANGERS"), (4) The banks and financial institutions whose names
            and addresses are set out in Schedule 1 of the Agreement as the
            Lenders (the "LENDERS"), (5) Nordea (as "FACILITY AGENT" and
            "SECURITY TRUSTEE") and (6) Danish Ship Finance (as "CO-ARRANGER")
            (the "FACILITY AGREEMENT"); and

      (b)   the letter dated 19 October 2004 from the Guarantor to the Facility
            Agent requesting that certain amendments be made to the Facility
            Agreement (the "AMENDMENT REQUEST LETTER").

2     Unless the context otherwise requires, words and expressions used in this
      letter shall have the meaning given to them in the Facility Agreement.

3     The amendments requested by the Amendment Request Letter require the
      approval of all the Lenders pursuant to the provisions of clause

      amendments requested by the Amendment Request Letter and have

      obtained their written approval to the amendments being made in accordance
      with the terms and conditions of this letter.

4     In consideration of the payment by the Borrowers and or the Guarantor on
      their behalf (as the case may be) of a fee of $10,000 for each Lender, we
      can confirm that with effect from the Effective Date the Lenders have
      agreed the following amendments to the Facility Agreement:

      (a)   clause 10.3(a) - shall be deleted in its entirety and the words
            "INTENTIONALLY DELETED" inserted therefore; and

      (b)   clause 10.5(a) - shall be amended in its entirety and the following
            clause inserted therefore:

            "(a)  the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (prevailing during the four
                  (4) financial quarters ending on each Quarterly Financial
                  Statements Preparation Date) to Consolidated Interest Expenses
                  (prevailing during the four (4) financial quarters ending on
                  each Quarterly Financial Statements Preparation Date) is:

                  (i)   during the period commencing on the 30 September 2004
                        until the Quarterly Financial Statement Preparation Date
                        ending on (and for the avoidance of doubt including) 30
                        September 2005, 2.00 to 1.00; and

                  (ii)  during the period commencing after the period described
                        in clause 10.5(a)(i) until the last day of the Security
                        Period, 2.75 to 1.00;".

5     The amendments to the Facility Agreement set out in paragraph 4 of this
      letter shall only become effective upon the date (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") on
      which:

      (a)   the Facility Agent receives the fees described in paragraph 4 of
            this letter with respect to each Lender; and

      (b)   this letter has been returned duly executed by each of the Borrowers
            and the Guarantor by a duly authorised officer or officers; and

      (c)   the Facility Agent is satisfied that the preceding provisions of
            paragraph 5 of this letter have been complied with and has notified
            the Borrowers and the Guarantor in writing of such satisfaction,

      whereupon the Facility Agreement shall be amended and shall continue in
      full force and effect save as amended by this letter.

6     Following the execution of this letter on behalf of the Borrowers and the
      Guarantor, the Facility Agent shall be entitled to circulate a copy of
