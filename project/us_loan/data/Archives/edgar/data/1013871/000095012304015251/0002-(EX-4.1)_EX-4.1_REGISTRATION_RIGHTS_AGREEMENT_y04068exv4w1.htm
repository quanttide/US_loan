and Contribution.</B> (a)&nbsp;In connection with any Shelf
Registration Statement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Placement Agents, each Holder of Securities covered thereby, their respective
partners, directors, and officers and each person, if any, who controls either
Placement Agent or any such Holder within the meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the
Securities Act (the Placement Agents, Holders and such controlling persons are
referred to collectively as the &#147;Indemnified Parties&#148;) against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect
thereof (including, but not limited to, any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or actions relating to purchases and sales of the Securities) to
which each Indemnified Party may become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common
law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Shelf
Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment or supplement
thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, or in any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, and shall reimburse each
such Indemnified Party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;the Company
will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage
or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of the Placement Agents or any such Holder specifically
for inclusion therein and (ii)&nbsp;the foregoing indemnity, with respect to any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in any preliminary Prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration Statement,
shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder (or any person controlling such
Holder) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities purchased the Securities concerned, to the extent that a Prospectus
relating to such Securities was required to be delivered by such Holder under
the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim,
damage or liability of such Holder results from the fact that there was not
sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the
sale of such Securities to such person, a copy of the Final Prospectus if the
Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Holder at or prior to
the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person and the
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final prospectus
(or the final prospectus as supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in

of its officers who signs such Shelf Registration Statement and (iv)&nbsp;each

Company, but only in respect of written information relating to such Holder
furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for
inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This

may otherwise have.

notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a
governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect

that the Indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced (through the
forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure and (ii)
otherwise than under paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above. In case any such action is
brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not,
except with the consent of such indemnified party, be counsel to the
indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this
Section&nbsp;5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such

costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or

payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a)&nbsp;or
(b)&nbsp;above (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other from the Offering and the Shelf Registration
Statement, or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i)&nbsp;is
not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;above but also
the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Placement Agents or
such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other,
and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid
by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d)&nbsp;shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or
claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section&nbsp;5(d), the Holders of the Securities shall not be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net
proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Securities pursuant to
the Shelf Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such
Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph
(d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to
contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls
the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall
have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
