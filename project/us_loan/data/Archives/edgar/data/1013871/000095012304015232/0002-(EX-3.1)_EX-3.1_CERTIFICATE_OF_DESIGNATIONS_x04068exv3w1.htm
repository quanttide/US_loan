Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 The Preferred Stock will be a series consisting of 420,000 shares with

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Holders of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and
if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the
payment of dividends, cash dividends at the annual rate of 4.0% of the
Liquidation Preference per share. Such dividends shall be payable in arrears
in equal amounts quarterly on each Dividend Payment Date, beginning March&nbsp;15,
2005, in preference to, and in priority over, dividends on any Junior Stock but
subject to the rights of any Holders of Senior Stock or Parity Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Dividends shall be cumulative from the initial date of issuance or the
last Dividend Payment Date for which accumulated dividends were paid, whichever
is later, whether or not funds of the Issuer are legally available for the
payment of such dividends. Each such dividend shall be payable to the Holders
of record of shares of the Preferred Stock, as they appear on the Issuer&#146;s
stock register at the close of business on a Dividend Payment Record Date.
Accumulated and unpaid dividends for any past Dividend Periods may be declared
and paid at any time, without reference to any Dividend Payment Date, to
Holders of record on the date not more than 60&nbsp;days nor fewer than 10&nbsp;days
preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Accumulated and unpaid dividends for any past Dividend Period (whether
or not earned and declared) shall cumulate dividends at the annual rate of 4.0%
and shall be payable in the manner set forth in this Section&nbsp;2.1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The amount of dividends payable for each full Dividend Period for the
Preferred Stock shall be computed by dividing the annual dividend rate by four.
The amount of dividends payable for the initial Dividend Period, or any other
period shorter or longer than a full Dividend Period, on the Preferred Stock
shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year.
Dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock, including Liquidated Damages, if
any, will be payable in cash. Holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled
to any dividends in excess of cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on the
Preferred Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;No dividend shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment or
other distribution declared or made, whether in cash, obligations or shares of
Capital Stock of the Issuer or other property, directly or indirectly, upon any
shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock, nor shall any shares of Junior Stock or
Parity Stock be redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired for consideration
by the Issuer through a sinking fund or otherwise, unless all accumulated and
unpaid dividends, including Liquidated Damages, if any, through the most recent
Dividend Payment Date (whether or not there are funds of the Issuer legally
available for the payment of dividends) on the shares of Preferred Stock and
any Parity Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid in full
or set apart for payment; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any
provisions of this paragraph (e)&nbsp;to the contrary, the Issuer may redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration Parity Stock pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all Holders of such
Preferred Stock and Parity Stock. When dividends are not paid in full, as
aforesaid, upon the shares of Preferred Stock, all dividends declared on the
Preferred Stock and any other Parity Stock shall be declared and paid either
(i)&nbsp;pro rata so that the amount of dividends so declared on the shares of
Preferred Stock and each such other class or series of Parity Stock shall in
all cases bear to each other the same ratio as accumulated dividends on the
shares of Preferred Stock and such class or series of Parity Stock bear to each
other or (ii)&nbsp;on another basis that is at least as favorable as clause (i)&nbsp;to
the Holders of the Preferred Stock entitled to receive such dividends.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;Upon a Registration Default, liquidated damages shall accumulate on
the Preferred Stock at the rate of 0.25% per annum, whether or not funds of the
Issuer are legally available for the payment of such liquidated damages, (such
liquidated damages, the &#147;Liquidated Damages&#148;), from and including the date on
which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on
which all Registration Defaults have been cured.

distributions upon the liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Issuer,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;senior to all classes of Common Stock and each other class of Capital
Stock or series of preferred stock issued by the Issuer, the terms of which

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Holder of Preferred Stock shall have the right, at its option, at any
time and from time to time, to convert, subject to the terms and provisions of
this Article&nbsp;4, any or all of such Holder&#146;s shares of Preferred Stock. In such
case, the shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted into such whole number
of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is equal to the
Conversation Rate then in effect, except that with respect to any share that
shall be called for redemption such, right shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the second Business Day prior to the Redemption Date unless
the Issuer shall default in making the payment due upon redemption thereof.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Conversion of shares of the Preferred Stock may be effected by any
Holder thereof upon the surrender to the Issuer, at the principal office of the
Issuer or at the office of the Transfer Agent as may be designated by the Board
of Directors, of the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted accompanied by a complete and manually signed Conversion
Notice (as set forth in the form of Preferred Stock certificate attached
hereto) along with (i)&nbsp;appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as
required by the Transfer Agent and (ii)&nbsp;if required pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.3,
funds equal to the dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date. In case
such Conversion Notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such
Holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes
payable upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock in such name or names.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Other than such taxes, the Issuer shall pay any documentary, stamp or
similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance
or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of the
Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The conversion of the Preferred Stock will be
deemed to have been made on the date (the &#147;Conversion Date&#148;) such certificate
or certificates have been surrendered and the receipt of such Conversion Notice
and payment of all required transfer taxes, if any (or the demonstration to the
satisfaction of the Issuer that such taxes have been paid). Promptly (but no
later than five Business Days) following the Conversion Date, the Issuer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered (i)&nbsp;certificates representing the number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of Common Stock to
which the Holder of shares of the Preferred Stock being converted (or such
Holder&#146;s transferee) shall be entitled, and (ii)&nbsp;if less than the full number
of shares of the Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or
certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like
tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such surrendered certificate or
certificates less the number of shares being converted. On the Conversion
Date, the rights of the Holder of the Preferred Stock as to the shares being
converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares of Common Stock
and the Person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock shall be treated
for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Common
Stock at such time.

Preferred Stock is held in global form, the Conversion Notice may be delivered

of such Preferred Stock in global form may be surrendered for conversion in

time.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;If a Holder of shares of Preferred Stock exercises conversion rights,
such shares will cease to accumulate dividends as of the end of the day
immediately preceding the Conversion Date. On conversion of the Preferred
Stock, except for conversion during the period from the close of business on
any Dividend Payment Record Date corresponding to a Dividend Payment Date to
the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Dividend
Payment Date, in which case the Holder on such Dividend Payment Record Date
shall receive the dividends payable on such Dividend Payment Date, accumulated
and unpaid dividends on the converted share of Preferred Stock shall not be
cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in
full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with
the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the
Preferred Stock being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof. Shares of
the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion after the close of business on
any Dividend Payment Record Date for the payment of dividends declared and
before the opening of business on the Dividend Payment Date corresponding to
that Dividend Payment Record Date must be accompanied by a payment to the
Issuer in cash of an amount equal to the dividend payable in respect of those
shares on such Dividend Payment Date; provided that a Holder of shares of the
Preferred Stock on a Dividend Payment Record Date who converts such shares into
shares of Common Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be
entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares of the Preferred Stock
on such Dividend Payment Date, and

dividend upon surrender of shares of the Preferred Stock for conversion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of the Preferred Stock are
converted during the period between the close of business on any Dividend
Payment Record Date and the opening of business on the corresponding Dividend
Payment Date and the Issuer has called such shares of the Preferred Stock for
redemption during the period between the close of business on any Dividend
Record Date and the close of business on the business day immediately
succeeding such Dividend Record Date, or the Issuer has designated a
Fundamental Change Purchase Date during such period, then, in each case, the
Holder who tenders such shares for conversion shall receive the dividend
payable on such Dividend Payment Date and need not include payment of the
amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of the Preferred Stock for
conversion.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the conversion of any shares of the Preferred Stock, no
fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but the Issuer shall pay a
cash adjustment in respect of any fractional interest in an amount equal to the
fractional interest multiplied by the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on
the Conversion Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If more than one share of the Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for
conversion by the same Holder at the same time, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of those shares shall be computed on the
basis of the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock so surrendered.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6 Reservation of Shares; Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance with
Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Issuer shall: (a)&nbsp;at all times reserve and keep available, free
from preemptive rights, for issuance upon the conversion of shares of the
Preferred Stock such number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock, or shares of Common Stock held in treasury, as shall from time to time
be sufficient if necessary to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares
of the Preferred Stock; (b)&nbsp;prior to the delivery of any securities that the
Issuer shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Preferred Stock,
comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations that require
action to be taken by the Issuer (including, without limitation, the
registration or approval, if required, of any shares of Common Stock to be
provided for the purpose of conversion of the Preferred Stock hereunder); and
(c)&nbsp;ensure that all shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock, upon delivery, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and
nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive
rights.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
secure as soon as practicable the approval of the New York Stock Exchange (the
&#147;NYSE&#148;) for the listing of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock of
the Company sufficient to

Until such time as the Company shall have obtained such approval from the NYSE,
all conversions of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be satisfied using
shares of Common Stock of the Company held in treasury and, until such approval
has been obtained from the NYSE, the Company shall reserve at all times a
sufficient number of shares of Common Stock in treasury for such conversions.
The Company shall have no further obligations under this paragraph after such
approval has been obtained from the NYSE.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.7 The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Stock Splits and Combinations. In case the Issuer shall (i)&nbsp;subdivide
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (ii)
combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares or (iii)&nbsp;issue by reclassification of the shares of Common
Stock any shares of Capital Stock of the Issuer, the Conversion Price shall be
adjusted so that the Holder of any shares of Preferred Stock thereafter
surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of
Common Stock that such Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive had
such shares of Preferred Stock been surrendered for conversion immediately
prior to the occurrence of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this
paragraph (a)&nbsp;shall become effective immediately at the close of business on
the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. Such adjustment
shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Stock Dividends in Common Stock. In case the Issuer shall at any time
or from time to time after the original issuance date of the Preferred Stock
pay a dividend or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock on any class of
Capital Stock of the Issuer other than dividends or distributions of shares of
Common Stock or other securities with respect to which adjustments are provided
in Section&nbsp;4.7(a) above, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the
Holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive upon
conversion thereof the number of shares of Common Stock determined by
multiplying (1)&nbsp;the applicable Conversion Price by (2)&nbsp;a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock theretofore
outstanding and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of
shares and the total number of shares issued in such dividend or distribution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Issuance of Rights or Warrants. In case the Issuer shall issue to all
or substantially all Holders of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling such
Holders (for a period commencing no earlier than the date of distribution and
expiring not more than 45&nbsp;days after the record date for such distribution) to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than
the average Closing Sale Price for the 10 Trading Days immediately preceding
the date the distribution of such rights or warrants was first publicly
announced by the Issuer, the Conversion Price shall be decreased so that the
Conversion Price shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date

for such issue by a fraction,



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at the close of business on such date of public
announcement, plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the
aggregate subscription or purchase price for

warrants so issued would purchase at such average Closing Sale Price,
and

Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such date of public
announcement, plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock
offered by such rights or warrants.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or
warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after such record
date. If at the end of the period during which such rights or warrants are
exercisable not all rights or warrants have been exercised, the adjusted
Conversion Price shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been
upon application of the foregoing adjustment substituting the number of
additional shares of Common Stock actually issued for the total number of
shares of Common Stock offered.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Distribution of Indebtedness, Capital Stock, Securities or Assets. In
case the Issuer shall distribute to all or substantially all Holders of Common
Stock any shares of Capital Stock or evidences of indebtedness, other
securities or other assets (excluding (i)&nbsp;those rights or warrants referred to
in Section&nbsp;4.7(c); (ii)&nbsp;those dividends, distributions, subdivisions,
combinations and reclassifications referred to in Sections&nbsp;4.7(a)-(b); and
(iii)&nbsp;those dividends and distributions paid in cash referred to in Section
4.7(g)), then in each such case the Conversion Price shall be decreased so that
the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
distribution by a fraction,



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the record
date for the determination of Holders of Common Stock entitled to receive
such distribution less the fair market value on such record date (as
determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be
conclusive evidence of such fair market value) of the portion of the
Capital Stock or evidences of indebtedness, securities or assets so
distributed or of such rights or warrants, in each case applicable to one
share of Common Stock, and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the denominator of which shall be the Market Value on such
record date,

Holders of Common Stock any shares of Capital Stock of, or similar equity
interest in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Issuer, the Conversion
Price will be adjusted based on the fair market value of the securities so
distributed relative to the Market Value of the Common Stock, in each case
based on the average Closing Sales Prices of those securities for the 10

reclassification of our Common Stock; (ii)&nbsp;a consolidation, merger or

substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer to any another
Person, the Holder of each share of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the occurrence of such events shall have the right upon any subsequent
conversion to receive (but only out of legally available funds of the Issuer,
to the extent required by applicable law) the kind and amount of stock, other
securities, other property, assets or cash that such Holder would have received
if such share had been converted immediately prior thereto. In such a case,
any increase in the Conversion Rate by Additional Shares as described in
Section&nbsp;4.7(i) will not be payable in shares of Common Stock, but will
represent a right to the aggregate amount of securities, cash and other
property into which the Additional Shares would convert upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph (h), if the Issuer elects
to adjust the Conversion Rate and conversion obligations as described in
Section&nbsp;4.7(j), the provisions described in that section will apply instead of
the provisions described in the first sentence of this paragraph.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) If a Fundamental Change occurs and 10% or more of the
consideration for the shares of Common Stock (other than cash payments
for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of a dissenters&#146;
appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of
cash, or other property or securities that are not traded or scheduled to
be traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national
securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, the Issuer will
decrease the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock which will increase
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion (the
&#147;Additional Shares&#148;) during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period as
set forth in this paragraph (i). A Holder of shares of Preferred Stock
may only elect to convert its shares of Preferred Stock in connection
with such Fundamental Change transaction at any time from and after the
date which is 15&nbsp;days prior to the anticipated effective date of such
Fundamental Change transaction until and including the date which is 15
days after the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change transaction (the
&#147;Fundamental Change Conversion Period&#148;). The number of Additional Shares
will be determined by reference to the table set forth in this paragraph
(i), based on the date on which such Fundamental Change transaction
becomes effective (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and the price (the &#147;Stock
Price&#148;) paid per share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Change
transaction. If Holders of shares of Common Stock receive only cash in
such Fundamental Change transaction, the Stock Price shall be the cash
amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average
of the Closing Sale Price of the shares of Common Stock on the five
Trading Days prior to but not including the Effective Date of such
Fundamental Change transaction. The Stock Prices set forth in the table
below will be adjusted as of any date

6.7137 per share of Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment.
Notwithstanding the provisions in this paragraph (i), in no event will
the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
exceed approximately 31.1333 per share of Preferred Stock, subject to
adjustments in the same manner as the Conversion Price is adjusted as set
forth in this Section&nbsp;4.7. The exact Stock Price and Effective Date may
not be set forth on the above table, in which case if the Stock Price is:
(A)&nbsp;between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is
between two dates on the table, the number of Additional Shares will be
determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of shares
of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price
amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; (B)
equal to or in excess of $200 per share (subject to adjustment), no
shares of Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion; or (C)&nbsp;less
than $32.12 per share (subject to adjustment), no shares of Additional
Shares will be issued upon conversion.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Notice must be given by the Issuer to all Holders of Preferred
Stock at least 15 Trading Days prior to the anticipated Effective Date
notifying the Holders as to the election by the Issuer to either increase
the Conversion Rate as provided in this paragraph (i)&nbsp;or adjust the
Conversion Rate as provided in Section&nbsp;4.7(j). Notice must also be given
by the Issuer to all Holders of Preferred Stock notifying such Holders
that such Fundamental Change has become effective.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Notwithstanding Section&nbsp;4.7(i) above, in the event of a Public
Acquirer Fundamental Change, the Issuer may, in lieu of increasing the
Conversion Rate by additional shares pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.7(i) above,
elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related conversion obligation
such that, from and after the Effective Date of such

Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert their shares of the Preferred
Stock into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock that have
been registered, or the resale of which will be registered under the Act,
by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the
Public Acquirer Fundamental Change by a fraction,



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The numerator of which will be (i)&nbsp;in the case of a
consolidation, merger or binding share exchange, pursuant to which
shares of Common Stock are converted into or exchanged for the
right to receive cash, securities or other property, the average
value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the
Board of Directors) paid or payable per share of Common Stock or
(ii)&nbsp;in the case of any other Public Acquirer Fundamental Change,
the average of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock for the
five consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the Effective
Date of such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The denominator of which will be the average of the last
Closing Sale Prices of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the
five consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next
succeeding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Fundamental
Change.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If the Issuer elects to adjust the Conversion Rate and
conversion obligation in connection with a Public Acquirer Fundamental
Change, Holders of the Preferred Stock will not have the right to require
the Issuer to repurchase their Preferred Stock pursuant to Article&nbsp;6 or
to convert at an adjusted Conversion Rate as described in Section&nbsp;4.7(i).
For the purposes of this paragraph (j), a &#147;Public Acquirer Fundamental
Change&#148; means any Fundamental Change that would otherwise obligate the
Issuer to increase the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.7(i) and the
acquirer (or any entity that is a directly or indirectly wholly-owned
subsidiary of the acquirer) has a class of common stock traded on a U.S.
national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or
that will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection
with such Fundamental Change (the &#147;Public Acquirer Common Stock&#148;). If an
acquirer does not itself have a class of common stock satisfying the
foregoing requirement, it will be deemed to have &#147;Public Acquirer Common
Stock&#148; if a corporation that directly or indirectly owns at least a
majority of the acquirer, has a class of common stock satisfying the
foregoing requirement; and in each case such Person has taken all
necessary action to ensure that upon conversion of the shares of
Preferred Stock into such class of common stock, such class of common
stock will not be treated as &#147;restricted securities&#148; and will otherwise
be eligible for immediate sale in the public market by non-affiliates of
the Issuer absent a registration statement, and all references to Public
Acquirer Common Stock will refer to such class of common stock.
&#147;Majority owned&#148; for these purposes means having the &#147;beneficial
ownership&#148; (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than
50% of the total voting power of all shares of the respective entity&#146;s
capital stock that are entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors.

and related conversion obligation upon a Public Acquirer Fundamental
Change, Holders of the Preferred Stock may convert their shares of
Preferred Stock at the adjusted Conversion Rate described in this
paragraph (j); however, such Holders will not be entitled to the
increased Conversion Rate pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.7(i).

additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or

employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by
the Issuer or any Subsidiaries;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to
any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible
security not described in subsection (ii)&nbsp;and outstanding as of the date
the Preferred Stock was first issued;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;

including Liquidated Damages; or

otherwise participate in such event without conversion solely as a Holder

Issuer, upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common
Stock, a Holder will receive, in addition to shares of Common Stock, the rights
under such rights plan, unless the rights have separated from shares of Common
Stock at the time of conversion, in which case the Conversion Rate will be
adjusted as if shares of Capital Stock or evidences of indebtedness, other
securities or other assets were distributed to all Holders of shares of Common
Stock as described in Section&nbsp;4.7(d), subject to readjustment in the event of
the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to give effect to any

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o)&nbsp;In any case in which the above Sections&nbsp;4.7(a)-(j) require that an
adjustment as a result of any event become effective from and after a record

record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares issuable

of Common Stock.

for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution,
and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof
legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then
thereafter no adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the right of conversion granted by the above Sections&nbsp;4.7(a)-(j) or
in the Conversion Price then in effect shall be required by reason of the
taking of such record.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(q)&nbsp;The Issuer may, from time to time, increase the Conversion Rate if the
Board of Directors has made a determination that this increase would be in the
best interests of the Issuer. Any such determination by the Board of Directors
will be conclusive. In addition, the Issuer may increase the Conversion Rate
if the Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income
tax to Holders of Common Stock resulting from any stock or rights distribution.

surrendered for partial purchase.

unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property law, together
with interest, if any, thereon held by them for the payment of the Fundamental
Change purchase price; provided, however, that to the extent that the aggregate
amount of cash deposited by the Issuer pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.8 exceeds the
aggregate purchase price of the Preferred Stock or portions thereof which the
Issuer is obligated to purchase as of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date,
then on the Business Day following the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, the
Transfer Agent shall return any such excess to the Issuer. Thereafter, any
Holder entitled to payment must look to the Issuer for payment as general
creditors, unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another
