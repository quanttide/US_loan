<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>NRG Energy Completes $950 Million Senior Debt Refinancing</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>PRINCETON, NJ;
December&nbsp;27, 2004&#151;</B>NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) announced
today that it amended and restated its
$950&nbsp;million senior secured credit facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The amended and restated facility includes a $150&nbsp;million revolving credit facility and an $800
million term loan, $350&nbsp;million of which will be used to prefund a letter of credit facility to
support working capital needs. The interest rate on the $800&nbsp;million term loan will be LIBOR plus
1.875&nbsp;percent going forward, a reduction of 212.5 basis points
from the prior facility. In addition, the covenants under the amended
facility are less restrictive, and in many respects match the covenants in NRG&#146;s outstanding 8%
high yield note indenture.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We view our ability to restructure our senior debt facility on such attractive terms as
recognition by the financial community of our strong operational performance and of the new NRG&#146;s
fundamental commitment to prudent balance sheet management,&#148; said Robert Flexon, Chief Financial
Officer. &#147;This is a very positive reflection on the outstanding work done by the entire NRG team
over the past year.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman, Sachs &#038; Co. arranged the financing for NRG.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NRG Energy, Inc. owns and operates a diverse portfolio of power-generating facilities, primarily in
the Northeast, South Central and West Coast regions of the United States. Its operations include
baseload, intermediate, peaking, and cogeneration facilities, thermal energy production and energy
resource recovery facilities. NRG also has ownership interests in generating facilities in
Australia and Germany.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain statements included in this news release are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Forward-looking statements above include, but are not limited to the portion of the funds
being used to prefund a letter of credit facility. Although NRG believes that its expectations are
reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct.
Factors that could cause NRG&#146;s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the
forward-looking statements above include, among others, the inability to utilize a portion of the
funds to prefund a letter of credit facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NRG undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could
cause NRG&#146;s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking
statements included in this news release should not be construed as exhaustive. For more
