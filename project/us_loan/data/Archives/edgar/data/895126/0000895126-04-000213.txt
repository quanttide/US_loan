            CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION ANNOUNCES PRICING OF OFFER
                  TO EXCHANGE COMMON STOCK FOR 6.0% CUMULATIVE
                           CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

OKLAHOMA  CITY,  OKLAHOMA,  DECEMBER  27, 2004 - Chesapeake  Energy  Corporation
(NYSE:CHK)  today  announced the pricing for its offer to exchange shares of its
common  stock  for each  outstanding  share of its 6.0%  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred Stock (CUSIP Nos. 165167-70-1 and 165167-60-2),  commenced on November
30, 2004.

Chesapeake  is offering to exchange  5.3260  shares of its common stock for each
share of its outstanding 6.0% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock tendered in
the exchange  offer.  The number of shares of common  stock to be exchanged  for
each share of Preferred  Stock (the "Exchange  Ratio") was fixed after 5:00 p.m.
EST on Thursday,  December 23, 2004 (the  "Pricing  Date"),  on the basis of the
pricing formula set forth in the related exchange offer prospectus. The Exchange
Ratio is equal to the sum of (i) 4.8605  shares of common  stock,  the number of
shares  into which the  Preferred  Stock is  presently  convertible,  and (ii) a
number of  additional  shares of common stock equal to $7.75  divided by $16.65,
which is the arithmetic daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock,
over the ten-day trading period beginning on December 10, 2004 and ending on the
Pricing  Date.  The  exchange  offer is subject to the  satisfaction  of certain
conditions.

The Preferred  Stock is listed on the New York Stock  Exchange  under the symbol
"CHKPrA", and Chesapeake's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "CHK".

The  exchange  offer is  scheduled  to expire at 12:00  midnight EST on Tuesday,
December 28, 2004, unless extended or earlier terminated by Chesapeake.  Holders
may withdraw  tendered shares of Preferred Stock at any time before the exchange
offer expires, or if not previously returned, a holder may withdraw any tendered
shares of  Preferred  Stock that are not  accepted  by  Chesapeake  on or before
January  26,  2005.  The  tender and  withdrawal  of shares of  Preferred  Stock
pursuant to the Offer held in "street" name are subject to  compliance  with the
appropriate procedures of the automated tender offer procedures, or ATOP, system
of The Depository Trust Company.

The exchange offer is being made pursuant to an exchange offer  prospectus dated
