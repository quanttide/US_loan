SECTION 7 - REGULATION FD

ITEM 7.01 - REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

On December 27,  2004,  Chesapeake  Energy  Corporation  issued a press  release
announcing  an  agreement  to acquire  BRG  Petroleum  Corporation  and  related
partnerships and announcing the closing of an acquisition by Chesapeake  Energy
Corporation of certain properties from Hallwood Energy  Corporation.  The press
release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.


SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS

ITEM 8.01 - OTHER EVENTS.

On December  27,  2004,  Chesapeake  Energy  Corporation  announced  that it has
entered into an agreement to acquire  privately-held  BRG Petroleum  Corporation
and  related  partnerships  for  $325  million  in  cash.  In this  transaction,
Chesapeake  anticipates acquiring an internally estimated 223 billion cubic feet
of  natural  gas  equivalent  proved  reserves  (bcfe)  and  net  production  of
approximately 30 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent production (mmcfe)
per day from 477 existing wells. The company has hedged 67% of BRG's current gas
production  at NYMEX gas  prices of $7.42 per mmbtu and $7.45 per mmbtu for 2005
and 2006, respectively.

         BRG's properties are concentrated in the  Mid-Continent  and Ark-La-Tex
regions.  In these areas,  Chesapeake has identified over 200 proved undeveloped
drilling  locations on BRG's leasehold.  The drilling locations are concentrated
in the Sahara gas  resource  play in  Northwest  Oklahoma  and in the East Texas
Cotton Valley gas resource play in Nacogdoches County, Texas.

     The BRG acquisition is expected to close on February 1, 2005 and is subject
to customary  closing  conditions  and purchase  price  adjustments.  Chesapeake
intends  to  finance  the  acquisition  from  cash on hand and by using its bank
credit facility. Chesapeake is negotiating to expand its bank credit facility to
$1 billion and extending the maturity of the facility to 2010.

         On December 15, 2004, Chesapeake closed its $292 million acquisition of
Barnett Shale  properties  from  Hallwood  Energy  Corporation.  In the Hallwood
acquisition,  Chesapeake acquired Hallwood's 18,000 North Block asset in Johnson
County,  Texas.  Through this  transaction,  Chesapeake  acquired an  internally
estimated 135 bcfe of proved  reserves and net  production of  approximately  25
mcfe per day.  Chesapeake is currently utilizing two rigs to further develop the
North Block asset and is  participating  as non-operator in two rigs operated by
Hallwood that are operating on Hallwood's  South Block,  in which CHK owns a 44%
working interest.

     This  current  report  on Form 8-K  includes  "forward-looking  statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the  Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking  statements  give our
current  expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include  estimates of
oil and gas reserves,  expected oil and gas  production,  business  strategy and
other  plans  and  objectives  for  future  operations.  Disclosures  concerning
derivative  contracts and their estimated  contribution to our future results of
operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market
prices are subject to significant volatility.

     Factors that could cause actual results to differ  materially from expected
results  include  the  volatility  of oil and gas  prices;  adverse  effects our
substantial  indebtedness  and  preferred  stock  obligations  could have on our
operations and future growth; our ability to compete  effectively against strong
independent  oil and gas companies  and majors;  possible  financial  losses and
significant  collateral  requirements  as a result  of our  commodity  price and
interest rate risk management  activities;  uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of oil and gas reserves,  including  reserves we acquire;  projecting
future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures;  exposure
to potential  liabilities of acquired  properties and companies;  our ability to
replace  reserves;  the  availability  of  capital;  writedowns  of oil  and gas
carrying values if commodity prices decline;  environmental  and other claims in
excess of insured amounts resulting from drilling and production operations; and
the loss of key  personnel.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking  statements,  which  speak  only as of the  date  of this  press
release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.

     Our  production  forecasts are dependent upon many  assumptions,  including
estimates of production  decline rates from existing  wells and the  undertaking
and outcome of future  drilling  activity,  which may be affected by significant
commodity  price  declines  or  drilling  cost  increases.  Also,  our  internal
estimates  of  reserves,  particularly  those in the  properties  proposed to be
acquired  where  we may  have  limited  review  of data or  experience  with the
reserves,  may be subject to revision and may be different from estimates by our
external reservoir engineers at year-end.  Although we believe the expectations,
estimates and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking  statements
are  reasonable,  we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.
They can be affected by inaccurate  assumptions  and data or by known or unknown
risks and uncertainties.
