               INTERMAGNETICS REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE

               o   SALES EXCEED $75 MILLION, SOLID CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL
                   BUSINESSES
               o   OPERATING EARNINGS, BEFORE ACQUISITION-RELATED AND CERTAIN
                   NON-CASH ITEMS, REACH $0.28

               o   STRONG CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE CONTINUES, DEBT LEVELS
                   AGGRESSIVELY REDUCED

LATHAM, NY, DECEMBER 20, 2004--Intermagnetics General Corporation (NASDAQ:
IMGC), benefiting from its first full quarter of results from its most recently
acquired business as well as ongoing strength in "historical" operations, today
reported that second-quarter net income increased about 75 percent to $7.9
million, or $0.28 per diluted share, excluding acquisition and
integration-related expenses and certain non-cash items. Reported net income for
the second quarter ended November 28, 2004 was $4.1 million, or $0.15 per
diluted share. All per share amounts have been adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock
split completed in August 2004. Second-quarter net sales were $75.2 million,
versus $39.9 million last year.

For the first six months of fiscal 2005, normalized net income, before items,
reached $13.5 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. Reported net income was $9.4
million, or $0.34 per diluted share. Net sales for the six-month period reached
nearly $135 million.

"We are pleased with the broad-based success of our second-quarter performance,"
said Glenn H. Epstein, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our revenues are
right on target to cyclical expectations and are expected to continue to flow
consistently from our continuing businesses going forward. Our new operating
business model is also yielding profits and cash flow in line with prior
forecasts both from historical and acquired businesses.

"The expected $53 million in overall proceeds from our previously announced sale
of Polycold, combined with our accelerating free cash flow, will enable us to
substantially pay down acquisition-related debt and dramatically reduce interest
expenses," Epstein said. "It will also provide us even greater financial
flexibility in pursuing strategic initiatives to further grow Intermagnetics."

Epstein noted that once the divestiture of Polycold is complete, Intermagnetics
will be well- positioned in the Medical Device marketplace with three current
businesses: the design, manufacture and sale of superconducting magnets for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems (the Magnet Business Group); the
design, manufacture and sale of radio frequency (RF) coils and related
sub-systems used by MRI systems (Invivo(TM) Diagnostic Imaging); the design,
manufacture and sale of patient monitoring systems (Invivo(TM) Patient Care). In

                                     -More-

addition, Intermagnetics, subsidiary SuperPower, continues to make substantial
progress in developing second-generation (2G), high-temperature superconducting
(HTS) materials and related devices designed to enhance capacity, reliability
and quality of transmission & distribution of electrical power.

STRONG RESULTS FROM ALL SECTORS

"All of our businesses continued to report solid results during the second
quarter," Epstein said. "Magnet system sales came in at nearly $30 million with
operating profit of $6.7 million. Our high-field 3.0 Tesla magnets continue to
perform well, as our major OEM customer's integrated system maintains a strong
position in the marketplace with excellent growth potential in 2005. The new 1.0
Tesla High-Field Open (HFO) magnet was extraordinarily well received at a recent
major trade conference and is also positioned for substantial growth during
2005. Year-to-date sales of magnet systems were about $54 million.

Medical Devices sales were $33.6 million, yielding an operating profit of $5.4
million. Results from the acquired Invivo and MRID businesses substantially
boosted second-quarter results. Prior year's results consisted only of the
former Medical Advances RF coil business, which is now part of Invivo Diagnostic
Imaging. Year-to-date sales for the segment were nearly $60 million.

The Instrumentation segment, consisting of Polycold Systems, Inc., had another
strong quarter, with sales of nearly $9 million and operating profit of $2.3
million. Polycold continues to see demand for vacuum-related products across a
broad range of non-semiconductor related customers in Europe, the U.S. and the
Pacific Rim.

Intermagnetics' Energy Technology subsidiary, SuperPower, Inc., continued to
make substantial progress in developing commercially viable 2G HTS wire and
related devices. Second-quarter revenue was $3.0 million, more than triple last
year's level. Intermagnetics' contribution to support SuperPower's operations
was $1.7 million, down from $1.9 million last year--a direct result of improved
levels of third-party revenue sources. This trend of reduced year-over-year
investment is expected to be repeated in the third quarter.

Epstein noted that, effective in the second quarter, Intermagnetics has
reconstituted the Magnetic Resonance Imaging reporting segment information to
consist solely of magnet systems sales. The Medical Devices reporting segment
now includes Invivo Diagnostic Imaging, consisting of RF coils and other
components for MRI systems, and Invivo Patient Care, consisting of the
patient-monitor business. There were no changes to segment reporting data for
Instrumentation or Energy Technology.

BALANCE SHEET REMAINS STRONG, "RELOADING" FOR FUTURE GROWTH

The company reported operating cash flow of about $5 million during the quarter,
which when combined with existing cash balances, enabled Intermagnetics to
reduce its long-term debt to about $80 million, about $10 million of which was
in excess of scheduled requirements.

Cash flow generation is expected to accelerate in the third quarter which, when
combined with the cash proceeds from the Polycold transaction, will provide even
greater flexibility to continue aggressively paying down debt while maintaining
the ability to invest in ongoing growth opportunities throughout the operating
businesses in addition to other strategic alternatives.

PERFORMANCE AGAINST GOALS

"We have continued to exceed the gross-margin target of 42 percent that we
revised upwards following the Invivo acquisition. This favorable performance is
a result of beneficial product mix and ongoing cost-control efforts," Epstein
said. "As we mentioned in prior conference calls, we are now prepared to
formally revise this particular long-term performance metric to 45 percent.

"We believe that this goal is achievable due to the improved mix of products
following our acquisitions over the past year and the favorable impact of
increasing our percentage of sales to direct, versus OEM, customers."

Second-quarter operating income as a percent of sales was 17 percent, exceeding
the company's ongoing target of 15 percent, and a 48 percent return on assets
was consistent with working towards attaining a long-term goal of 50 percent.
Return on equity was 13 percent, versus the recently raised goal of 15 percent.

Efficiency in utilizing working capital was 20 percent, still short of the goal
of requiring less than 15 cents for each dollar of sales. "We have made some
modest improvement over the first quarter in reducing our working capital in the
newly acquired businesses," Epstein said. "We continue to place high priority on
adjusting the acquired companies' current inventories and accounts receivable to
the levels that we consider appropriate for Intermagnetics."

FORECAST FOR FISCAL YEAR REMAINS ON TARGET, Q3 OUTLOOK PROVIDED

"The ongoing strength across all of our business segments continues to reinforce
our confidence that fiscal 2005 will be a record year for our remaining
historical and newly acquired businesses," Epstein said. "Our prior forecast of
consolidated revenues right around $300 million and operating EPS--excluding
acquisition-related and non-cash performance-based stock compensation and other
charges or benefits--within the previously forecast range of $1.03 to $1.10
remains intact, with the exception that we expect to subtract about $8 to $9
million of Polycold revenue, assuming an on-schedule close, and about $0.03 to
$0.04 of operating EPS. Additional information will be provided when the
transaction is completed.

 "Our current outlook for the 'new Intermagnetics' third quarter is for revenue
and profit slightly below what we have just achieved in Q2. This is entirely
consistent with our prior guidance on the evolving business cycles of our newer
markets and customers, and we remain highly confident that the overall financial
objectives for the year will be achieved."

OPERATING EPS RECONCILIATION INFORMATION

Operating EPS excludes acquisition-related and non-cash performance-based stock
compensation and other charges or benefits.

Expected acquisition-related charges related to Invivo remain unchanged at
around $0.03 about evenly split among the first three quarters of FY2005.

Charges related to the acquisition of MRI Devices are still expected to total
about $0.12 to $0.14 in the year. MRID's non-cash transaction expenses result
from a change in accounting for stock distributed to the MRID employee base by
the original owners of MRID and a modest write-down of acquired assets (value of
MRID name) due to the re-branding of MRID to Invivo Diagnostic Imaging. Charges
totaled $0.09 in the second quarter (including the MRID employee-related stock
distribution charge of about $0.04 and about $0.02 resulting from the asset
write-down) with the balance expected in the second half of this fiscal year.

<PAGE>

The estimated non-cash charge for Intermagnetics' performance-based restricted
stock plan remains about $3.8 million post-tax, based on today's closing stock
price and current roster of plan participants. The company said it plans to
charge this $0.13 annualized estimate as evenly as practical over the balance of
the year ($0.03 recognized in Q1, $0.04 recognized in Q2).

Operating EPS also excludes a non-cash gain of $0.03 resulting from a favorable
adjustment to an environmental reserve recognized in the company's first
quarter.
