ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND

      On December 29, 2004, Cell Power Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") and
its President and sole director, Mr. Jacob Herskovits ("Employee"), entered into
an amendment to of Employee's employment agreement dated as of November 1, 2003,
pursuant to which Employee, beginning January 1, 2005 and continuing through the
term of the Agreement, will no longer be entitled to be paid a salary. All other
terms of the Agreement continue in full force and effect.

      In addition, the Company and two consultants, Superior Associates and
Judah Marvin Feigenbaum, have agreed to amend their respective consulting
agreements to reduce monthly payments payable thereunder. The amendment to such
consultants' agreement, together with the amendment to the employment agreement
with Employee, aggregate to a reduction of $29,500 in the Company's current
monthly cash outlays, which will represent a decrease of approximately one-third
in the Company's current monthly operating expenses.

      No assurance can however be given that these reductions in operating
expenses are sustainable for the foreseeable future.
