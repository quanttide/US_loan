GMX RESOURCES INC. ANNOUNCES OPERATIONS UPDATE, ACREAGE ADDITIONS AND 2005
INITIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE GUIDANCE

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Monday, December 20, 2004 GMX RESOURCES INC., NASDAQ
NMS: `GMXR'; Warrants: `GMXRW', (WWW.GMXRESOURCES.COM) announced today an update
to its activities and future plans. "The Company's production for the fourth
quarter could double the first quarter of 2004," stated Ken L. Kenworthy, Sr.,
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer of GMXR. "We have spent $8
million in capital expenditures this year and expect to spend as much as $15
million in 2005 developing our east Texas properties, depending on drilling
results and plans of our joint development partner, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas
Corporation ("PVOG"). Our development activities are expected to be funded
primarily by cash flow and additional debt as our borrowing base is expected to
grow as a result of increased proved developed producing reserves. This CAPEX
should fund: 26 gross (9 net) wells, several re-completions and additional
acreage acquisitions. During 2004 through December 1, we have increased our
acreage position in east Texas to 22,111 gross acres and 11,996 net acres, from
18,167 gross and 9,764 net at December 31, 2003."

OPERATIONAL AND JOINT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE:

FOURTH QUARTER ACTIVITY JD
During the fourth quarter through today, PVOG, a subsidiary of Penn Virginia
Corporation (NYSE: PVA), has completed six and drilled six Cotton Valley wells
in PHASE I of our joint development ("JD") project (GMXR has 30% interest in
PHASE I). Wells ten through fifteen have been completed. Total JD production
(net to GMXR) for October and November was approximately 47,000 and 55,000 mcfe
respectively. Well sixteen should be completed in late December. Well seventeen
reached total depth on December 15, 2004 after only 14 days of drilling and well
eighteen should begin soon.

GMXR has also elected to purchase its share of all acreage acquired by PVA in
both PHASE I & II TO DATE.

PLANNED ACTIVITY JD
Ken Kenworthy, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of GMXR said "PVA is attempting to
secure a second rig to be utilized for drilling in PHASES I AND II of our JD and
we are drafting an amendment to our agreement to allow GMXR to use one of the
rigs for its own use in PHASE III periodically. There is some encouragement that
a rig could be available by mid year 2005 for our project."

FOURTH QUARTER ACTIVITY COMPANY
Wells six and eight of our re-completion efforts in PHASE III have had gas lift
capabilities installed. Well six has added an additional zone to the Travis Peak
("TP") production string. Cotton Valley Sand ("CVS") and the TP production for
both wells will begin after installation of injection compression before year
end. The wells combined are expected to initially add 300 mcfgpd to our
production.

Well seven was acquired in the 3Q04, re-entered and cleaned out to the CVS at
9965'. The well was previously completed in the early 80's but not produced from
this zone for twenty years. We are laying our gathering line and plan to begin
producing next week. Our intention is to also produce the TP zone currently
producing in the well after completion in the Pettit next month.

The ninth re-completion of 2004 will begin before year end to deepen the
production string to include the Taylor Sands, add some additional perforations,
fracture treat the Taylor and then commingle with the Davis Sands of the CVS.

We have also recently installed a new compressor IN PHASE I and successfully
completed our salt water disposal well. Both will contribute to lowering lease
operating & compression expenses and optimize production from our activities
this year. Mr. Kenworthy, Jr. stated, "We have conducted a 1,000 well study of
the surrounding CVS producers, the results will be used for various purposes. It
is notable that our current fracture treatment methodology is providing superior
results in initial rate and production performance when compared to the wells
studied. "

PLANNED ACTIVITY COMPANY
GMXR could drill two or more 100% wells in PHASE III during 2005 if we are able
to locate a rig or share a rig with PVOG.

In New Mexico, in Lea County, GMXR entered into a farmout agreement and seismic
data sharing agreement with Yates Petroleum Corporation, which is expected to
complete its 3D seismic evaluations in January 2005. GMXR will review the data
and determine whether to elect to participate in the test well for up to 23%
working interest. We have also retained a 5.75% overriding royalty interest with
a conversion to 27.6% `back-in after payout interest' on the interest not
participated. If the seismic data is favorable, the drilling of the initial test
well is planned to begin in the 1stQ05 to a depth of 12,100 feet to test the
Atoka and Morrow formations. A completed well cost is estimated to be
$1,600,000. We also retained the right to participate in any offsets.

GMX RESOURCES INC. is an independent natural gas producer, headquartered in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. GMXR has interests in 65 gross/43.6 net producing wells
in Texas, Louisiana & New Mexico. GMXR also has a large inventory of development
prospects in North Carthage Field of East Texas as follows: 72 gross/39 net
Cotton Valley Sand locations on 160 acre spacing & 138 gross/75 net CVS
locations on 80 acre spacing. The Company's strategy is to significantly grow
production, grow its natural gas reserves and build shareholder value.
