<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>LIONVILLE, Pa., December 27, 2004
&#151; West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE: WST), the global market leader in closure
systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs, today announced that it has
signed a definitive agreement to sell a substantial majority interest in its Drug Delivery
business to a new company formed by Warburg Pincus to facilitate the acquisition. Closing
is expected to occur early in 2005. Under the agreement, West will transfer substantially
all of its technology-related Drug Delivery assets and receive $7.1 million in cash and
approximately 14% of the stock of the new company. In addition, West is entitled to earn
up to $19 million of contingent payments, based on royalties or other net profits earned
by the new company from West&#146;s technologies. Warburg Pincus has agreed to provide $40
million of new capital in two stages in order to finance the further development of
products based on West&#146;s technologies. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The drug delivery business will
operate from West&#146;s facility in Nottingham, England, and will employ all of the
Division&#146;s employees at that location. Drug Delivery operations at West&#146;s
Lionville facility will wind down following the transaction. Approximately 30 jobs will be
eliminated and the Company has notified affected employees. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In June of 2004, the Company
announced that it would conduct a strategic review of its drug delivery business, and that
it intended to complete that process by the end of 2004. As a result of the pending
transaction, the Company will take a pre-tax charge estimated to be between $4.0 million
and $7.0 million, or between $0.08 and $0.16 per diluted share, substantially all of which
will be reported in the fourth quarter of 2004. This includes estimated impairment charges
associated with intangible assets related to both the drug delivery technologies and the
clinical services unit, and related costs for severance and other transaction costs. The
Company&#146;s Drug Delivery division will be classified as a &#147;discontinued
operation&#148; in the Company&#146;s subsequent financial reports, including its clinical
services business, which the Company will continue to operate while it is held for sale or
other disposition. The ownership interest in the new company will be accounted for on a
cost basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Donald E. Morel, PhD, West&#146;s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, &#147;I am pleased that we have completed
the strategic review of options for the Drug Delivery Division and are able to announce
this transaction on our original schedule. This agreement will result in significant new
funding for the drug delivery technologies in partnership with world-class financial
sponsors who understand the market for these technologies, allowing us to participate in
the ultimate success of the business without committing further capital. This, in turn,
will focus management on building the long-term growth and profitability of West&#146;s
pharmaceutical systems businesses.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The charges associated with the Drug
Delivery division will lower the Company&#146;s GAAP earnings for the year. The Company is
affirming its earlier guidance for 2004 full year results and providing an update to give
effect to changes in how results will be reported for 2004. Because of the changes in the
Drug Delivery division, the Company&#146;s GAAP financial statements will reflect that
business segment&#146;s operating results for the year estimated to be between $0.31 and
$0.32 per diluted share as a &#147;discontinued operation&#148;, a separate component of
net income and earnings per share. A table included in this release reconciles the
Company&#146;s expected GAAP results, before the effects of the estimated charges
associated with the changes to the Drug Delivery division, the Company&#146;s prior
non-GAAP guidance of $1.00 to $1.05 per share and estimated earnings per share from
continuing operations of $1.31 to 1.37 per share. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company&#146;s management will

Regarding Forward-Looking Information </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Certain statements contained in this
press release or in other Company documents and certain statements that may be made by
management of the Company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by
the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words
such as &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148;
&#147;plan,&#148; &#147;anticipate&#148; and other words and terms of similar meaning in
connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or condition.
In particular, these include statements concerning future actions, future performance or
results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of
contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Because actual results are affected
by risks and uncertainties, the Company cautions investors that actual results may differ
materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.</FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
It is not
possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could
cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results
include, but are not limited to: successful completion of the disposition of the
Company&#146;s drug delivery technologies pursuant to the transactions described in this
release, including the Company&#146;s obtaining of necessary approvals and consents to the
transaction; the ability of the acquirer of the drug delivery technologies to develop and
market products based on those technologies; the Company&#146;s continued ability to
operate its clinical services business pending development and execution of a plan for
disposing of that business; sales demand, the timing of customers&#146; projects;
continued plant operating efficiencies; the Company&#146;s ability to maintain its market
position and pricing in the face of lower-cost competitors, particularly in the European
marketplace; the Company&#146;s ability to maintain a favorable mix of value-added
products in its portfolio; continued strong contribution from the Company&#146;s
affiliates; strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar; inflation; potential price increases
in raw materials, including those that are petroleum-based, and the continued availability
of raw materials; and the impact of recent tax legislation relating to repatriation of
foreign earnings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
With respect to the explosion and fire at the Company&#146;s Kinston, NC
plant, the following factors should also be taken into consideration: delays in receiving
customer approvals of the facility and products produced there, and achieving
cost-efficient levels of production in the new facility; continuing costs associated with
the plant; the unpredictability of existing and future possible litigation related to the
explosion and the adequacy of insurance recoveries for costs associated with such
litigation; the impact of government actions or investigations affecting the Company; the
extent of uninsured costs for, among other things, legal and investigation services and
incremental insurance; and regulatory approvals and customer acceptance of goods from
alternate sites. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company assumes no obligation to
update forward-looking statements as circumstances change. Investors are advised, however,
to consult any further disclosures the Company makes on related subjects in the
Company&#146;s 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company believes the comparisons
of period-to-period results of its ongoing business operations are aided by excluding the
insurance settlement, related uninsured costs and on-going additional production and legal
costs associated with the 2003 plant explosion in Kinston N.C., and by excluding
restructuring and impairment charges connected with the planned closure of its UK medical
device facility. Non-GAAP results also exclude a gain on the sale of real estate by the
Company&#146;s affiliate in Mexico. In addition, the results of the Drug Delivery segment
will be reported as a discontinued operation in current and future filings. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
