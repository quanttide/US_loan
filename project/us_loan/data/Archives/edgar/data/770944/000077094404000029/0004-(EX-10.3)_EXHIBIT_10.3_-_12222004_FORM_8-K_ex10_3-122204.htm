(&#147;Employee&#148;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore adopted the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan of

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHEREAS, it is a requirement of the Plan that a Restricted Stock Award Agreement
be executed to evidence the Restricted Stock Award granted to Employee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto have agreed,
and do hereby agree, as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><U>Grant of Award</U></B>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company hereby grants to
Employee a Restricted Stock Award of an aggregate of &lt;&lt;Shares&gt;&gt;
shares of the common stock, $.01 par value, of the Company (the
&#147;Shares&#148;) on the terms and conditions set forth herein.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><U>Issuance of Shares</U></B>.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as reasonably

certificates in respect of the appropriate number of Shares shall be delivered
to Employee) or, if earlier, until the Shares are forfeited to the Company and
canceled as provided in Section 3 of this Restricted Stock Award
Agreement.</FONT></P>
