<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Spartan Stores Sells Ownership Interest in Retail Store Joint Venture</B></FONT><BR>
<I>Proceeds Used to Reduce Outstanding Debt; Retains Customer Supply Agreement</I></P>

<P>GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN-December 23, 2004-Spartan Stores, Inc., (Nasdaq: SPTN) today announced that it has sold its 65 percent ownership interest in a retail store to its former joint venture partner.</P>

<P>Spartan's annualized retail sales and after-tax earnings from the joint venture approximated $20 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Total consideration from the transaction (including the repayment of previous advances) will be used to repay $2.0 million of related debt principal and reduce the amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility by approximately $2.5 million, resulting in a total debt reduction of $4.5 million. The Company entered into a 10-year distribution supply agreement with the acquirer and expects to record an after-tax gain of approximately $0.4 million in the fiscal 2005 third quarter due to the sale transaction. While future reported retail sales will be lower due to the sale, the Company's prior comparable store sales guidance is not impacted as sales from the joint venture store were not included in Spartan's comparable store sales totals. </P>

<P>"We are pleased to have reached an agreement to sell the ownership interest in our only retail store joint venture," stated Spartan Stores' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Craig C. Sturken. "The agreement is beneficial to both parties and we look forward to continuing our strong relationship with the store's owners by meeting their needs through our high quality distribution products and value-added services." </P>
