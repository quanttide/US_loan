<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, conditions and
agreements hereafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are all hereby acknowledged, the Borrower,
the Lenders, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Swing Line
Lender and the Administrative Agent covenant and agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;AMENDMENTS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The definition of &#147;Guarantee&#148; set forth in Section&nbsp;1.01 of the Credit

contingent or otherwise, of such Person guaranteeing or having the
economic effect of guaranteeing any Indebtedness or other
obligation payable or performable by another Person (the &#147;primary
obligor&#148;) in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, and
including any obligation of such Person, direct or indirect, (i)
to purchase or pay (or advance or supply funds for the purchase or
payment of) such Indebtedness or other obligation, (ii)&nbsp;to

of assuring the obligee in respect of such Indebtedness or other
obligation of the payment or performance of such Indebtedness or
other obligation, (iii)&nbsp;to maintain working capital, equity
capital or any other financial statement condition or liquidity or
level of income or cash flow of the primary obligor so as to
enable the primary obligor to pay such Indebtedness or other

in any other manner the obligee in respect of such Indebtedness or
other obligation of the payment or performance thereof or to
protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or
in part), or (b)&nbsp;any Lien on any assets of such Person securing
any Indebtedness or other obligation of any other Person, whether
or not such Indebtedness or other obligation is assumed by such
Person; provided, however, that a Springing Guarantee shall not be
deemed to be a Guarantee until the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;the
demand by a lender for payment under such Springing Guaranty, (ii)
the occurrence or failure to occur of any event, act or
circumstance that, with or without the giving of notice and/or
passage of time, entitles a lender to make a demand for payment
thereunder or (iii)&nbsp;a Bankruptcy Event. The amount of any
Guarantee shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the stated or
determinable amount of the related primary obligation, or portion
thereof, in respect of which such Guarantee is made or, if not
stated or determinable, the maximum reasonably anticipated
liability in respect thereof as determined by the guaranteeing
Person in good faith. The term &#147;Guarantee&#148; as a verb has a
corresponding meaning.

Person as of any date of determination thereof, without
duplication and to the extent not included as a liability on the
consolidated balance sheet of such Person and its Subsidiaries in
accordance with GAAP: (a)&nbsp;with respect to any asset
securitization transaction (including any accounts receivable
purchase facility) (i)&nbsp;the unrecovered investment of purchasers or
transferees of assets so transferred, and (ii)&nbsp;any other payment,
recourse, repurchase, hold harmless, indemnity or similar
obligation of such Person or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
assets transferred or payments made in respect thereof, other than
limited recourse provisions that are customary for transactions of
such type and that neither (x)&nbsp;have the effect of limiting the
loss or credit risk of such purchasers or transferees with respect
to payment or performance by the obligors of the assets so
transferred nor (y)&nbsp;impair the characterization of the transaction
as a true sale under applicable Laws (including Debtor Relief
Laws); (b)&nbsp;the monetary obligations under any financing lease or
so-called &#147;synthetic,&#148; tax retention or off-balance sheet lease
transaction which, upon the application of any Debtor Relief Law
to such Person or any of its Subsidiaries, would be characterized
as indebtedness; (c)&nbsp;any other monetary obligation arising with
respect to any other transaction which (i)&nbsp;upon the application of
any Debtor Relief Law to such Person or any of its Subsidiaries,
would be characterized as indebtedness or (ii)&nbsp;is the functional
equivalent of or takes the place of borrowing but which does not
constitute a liability on the consolidated balance sheet of such
Person and its Subsidiaries (for purposes of this clause (c), any
transaction structured to provide tax deductibility as interest
expense of any dividend, coupon or other periodic payment will be
deemed to be the functional equivalent of a borrowing); provided,
however, that (A)&nbsp;liabilities arising under rolling options and
similar contracts for the acquisition of real property incurred in
the ordinary course of business (B)&nbsp;liabilities arising under
model home leases in the ordinary course of

foreign law or by or against any Person for whom any Loan Party
has executed a Springing Guaranty for the benefit of such Person<B>;</B>

participate in the filing, whether directly or indirectly, of an
involuntary bankruptcy case against such Person or any other
Person, and such involuntary case or proceeding is not dismissed
