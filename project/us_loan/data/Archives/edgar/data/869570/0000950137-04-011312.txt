ITEM 1.01:  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 22, 2004, SPSS Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SPSS"), amended and
restated the consulting agreement that it maintains with Norman H. Nie
Consulting L.L.C., an Illinois limited liability company ("Nie Consulting"). Dr.
Norman H. Nie, the President of Nie Consulting, is the Chairman of the SPSS
Board of Directors. The original consulting agreement with Nie Consulting was
dated as of June 1, 2003 (the "Original Consulting Agreement"). The Amended and
Restated Consulting Agreement (the "Amended Consulting Agreement") will be
effective as of January 1, 2005. The terms of the Amended Consulting Agreement
will supersede and replace the terms of the Original Consulting Agreement.
Pursuant to the Amended Consulting Agreement, Nie Consulting will assist SPSS
with product management for the SPSS family of products and will assist the SPSS
technology group with the development of statements of requirements and
prioritization of new products and features in the areas of statistics, survey
research and text mining.

The Amended Consulting Agreement provides that Nie Consulting is to receive
compensation for these consulting services in the amount of $15,000 per month.
In addition, with the advance approval of SPSS's Chief Financial Officer, Nie
Consulting shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred while performing services under the Amended Consulting
Agreement. The Amended Consulting Agreement shall remain in effect from January
1, 2005 until either Nie Consulting or SPSS gives a written notice of
termination at least fifteen (15) days in advance of such termination. SPSS and
Nie Consulting agree to discuss, on a quarterly basis, whether the services
being provided by Nie Consulting are still needed by SPSS.

The Amended Consulting Agreement requires that Nie Consulting refrain from
disclosing confidential information about SPSS during the term of the Amended
Consulting Agreement and for a period of five (5) years after its expiration. In
addition, the Amended Consulting Agreement requires Nie Consulting to refrain
from engaging in any business that is competitive with the business of SPSS,
engaging, in any manner, in the development, sale, marketing, licensing and/or
distribution of any software or related product which is directly competitive
with SPSS products or engaging with any customers or clients of SPSS, during the
term of this Amended Consulting Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after
its expiration.

Nie Consulting has agreed to assign to SPSS title and interest in any inventions
developed by Nie Consulting for SPSS or any invention developed by Nie
Consulting using SPSS confidential information.

SPSS will file the Amended Consulting Agreement as an exhibit to its next
periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
