(1), two (2) year period subject to and upon the provisions set forth in this
subparagraph and subject to a Rent to be determined by the Landlord in its sole

Paragraph 35, Security Deposit shall be added to the Lease as follows:

(a)   The Tenant has deposited with the Landlord the sum of One Hundred Fifty
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00) as security for the faithful
performance and observance by the Tenant of the provisions of this Lease on its
part to be performed. If the Tenant defaults in respect of any of these
provisions, including the payment of rent, the Landlord may use, apply or retain
the whole or any part of the security so deposited to the extent required for
the payment of any rent for which the Tenant is in default or for any sum which
the Landlord may expend or may be required to expend by reason of the Tenant's
default in respect of any of these provisions, including any damages or
deficiency in the reletting of the Premises, whether such damages or deficiency

on the Tenant's part to be performed, the security shall be credited toward the
payment of rent as described in paragraph (b) hereof. If the Landlord sells or
leases the Building, the Landlord shall have the right to transfer the security

                                       2

to the vendee or lessee and the Landlord shall thereupon be released by the
Tenant from all liability for the return of such security. The Tenant agrees to
look solely to the new landlord for the return of said security. It is agreed
that the provisions hereof shall apply to every transfer or assignment made of
the security to a new landlord. The Tenant further covenants that it will not
assign, pledge or encumber or attempt to assign, pledge or encumber the monies
deposited herein as security and that neither the Landlord nor its successors or
assigns shall be bound by any such assignment, pledge or encumbrance, or
attempted assignment, attempted pledge or attempted encumbrance.

(b)   If Tenant is not in Default on March 31, 2009 the security deposit will be
credited toward the April 1, 2009 and May 1, 2009 rent payments as shown in
Schedule A, Table 1.
