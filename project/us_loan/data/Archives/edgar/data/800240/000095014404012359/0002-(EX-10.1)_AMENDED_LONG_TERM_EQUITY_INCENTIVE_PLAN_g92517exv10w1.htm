and binding on all parties. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan

not be required to establish any special or separate fund or make any other
segregation of assets to assume the payment of any award under the Plan, and

in part authorized and unissued, or shares which are held by the Company as
treasury shares. If any grant under the Plan or any Prior Plan expires or
terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited as to any Shares,
such unpurchased or forfeited Shares shall thereafter be available for further
grants under the Plan unless, in the case of options granted under the Plan or
any Prior Plan, related SARs are exercised.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>6. PARTICIPATION.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the Plan shall be limited to those directors (including
Non-Employee Directors), officers (including non-employee officers) and key
employees of, and other key individuals (including Non-Employees of the
Company) performing services for, the Company and its Subsidiaries selected by
the Committee (including participants located outside the United States).
Nothing in the Plan or in any grant thereunder shall confer any right on a
participant to continue in the employ of or the performance of services for the
Company or shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company to
terminate the employment or performance of services of a participant at any
time. By accepting any award under the Plan, each participant and each person
claiming under or through him or her shall be conclusively deemed to have
indicated his or her acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action
taken under the Plan by the Company, the Board or the Committee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determinations made by the Committee under the Plan need not be uniform
and may be made selectively among eligible individuals under the Plan, whether
or not such individuals are similarly situated. A grant of any type made
hereunder in any one year to an eligible participant shall neither guarantee
nor preclude a further grant of that or any other type to such participant in
that year or subsequent years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>7. INCENTIVE AND NONQUALIFIED OPTIONS.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may from time to time grant to eligible participants
Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options, or any combination
thereof; provided that the Committee may grant Incentive Stock Options only to
eligible Employees of the Company or its subsidiaries (as defined for this
purpose in Section 424(f) of the Code). In any one calendar year, the Committee
shall not grant to any one participant, options or SARs to purchase a number of
shares of Common Stock in excess of Two Million (2,000,000) shares (subject to
such adjustments as may be provided for under Section&nbsp;20 hereof). The options
granted shall take such form as the Committee shall determine, subject to the
following terms and conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Company&#146;s intent that Nonqualified Stock Options granted under
the Plan not be classified as Incentive Stock Options, that Incentive Stock
Options be

under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code and any successor thereto, and that any
ambiguities in construction be interpreted in order to effectuate such intent.
If an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan does not qualify as such
for any reason, then to the extent of such nonqualification, the stock option
represented thereby shall be regarded as a Nonqualified Stock Option duly
granted under the Plan, provided that such stock option otherwise meets the
Plan&#146;s requirements for Nonqualified Stock Options.

made being sometimes herein called &#147;optionees&#148; or &#147;grantees,&#148; as the case may
be).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Price. The price per Share payable by an optionee upon the exercise
of each option (the &#147;exercise price&#148;) shall be established by the Committee,
except that the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the Fair Market
Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of grant of the option, and in
the case of the grant of any Incentive Stock Option to an employee who, at the
time of the grant, owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the exercise price
may not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock
as of the date of grant of the option, in each case unless otherwise permitted
by Section&nbsp;422 of the Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Terms of Options. The term during which each option may be exercised
shall be determined by the Committee, but, except as otherwise provided herein,
in no event shall an option be exercisable in whole or in part, in the case of
a Nonqualified Stock Option or an Incentive Stock Option (other than as
described below), more than ten years from the date it is granted or, in the
case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an employee who at the time of the
grant owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if required by the Code, more
than five years from the date it is granted. All rights to purchase Shares
pursuant to an option shall, unless sooner terminated, expire at the date
designated by the Committee. The Committee shall determine the date on which
each option shall become exercisable and may provide that an option shall
become exercisable in installments. The Committee shall have the discretion to
provide in the form of option grant that the vesting and exercisability of the
option may be accelerated by the achievement of performance goals established
by the Committee at the time of grant. The performance goals shall be based on
one or more of the standards set forth in Section&nbsp;15 hereof. The Shares

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">installment may be purchased in whole or in part at any time after such
installment becomes exercisable, subject to such minimum exercise requirements
as may be designated by the Committee. Unless otherwise provided herein or in
the terms of the related grant, an optionee may exercise an option only if he
or she is, and has continuously since the date the option was granted, been a
director, officer or employee of or performed other services for the Company or
a Subsidiary. Prior to the exercise of an option and delivery of the Shares
represented thereby, the optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with
respect to any Shares covered by such outstanding option (including any
dividend or voting rights).

Market Value (determined as of the grant date) of Shares for which an Incentive

defined in Section&nbsp;424 of the Code) may not exceed $100,000.

Company&#146;s receipt of written notice of exercise in the form prescribed by the
Company, accompanied by payment of the exercise price of the Shares to be
acquired. However, no participant shall be eligible to exercise any Stock
Option (i)&nbsp;if the participant, at the time of the purported exercise, is not in
compliance with any provision of the Plan or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to which the
participant has not signed and returned to the Company a letter in the form
prescribed by the Company, acknowledging receipt of such Stock Option, agreeing

as the Company shall prescribe. Once given, a notice may not be withdrawn
without the consent of the Company.

payment shall be made (i)&nbsp;in cash (including check, bank draft or money order),
(ii)&nbsp;by delivery of outstanding shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value
on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price payable with
respect to the options&#146; exercise, (iii)&nbsp;by simultaneous sale through a broker
reasonably acceptable to the Committee of Shares acquired on exercise, as
permitted under Regulation&nbsp;T of the Federal Reserve Board, (iv)&nbsp;by authorizing
the Company to withhold from issuance a number of Shares issuable upon exercise
of the options which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock on the date of exercise is equal to the aggregate exercise price
payable with respect to the options so exercised or (v)&nbsp;by any combination of
the foregoing. or (v)&nbsp;such other form of payment as the Committee may permit in
its discretion.

such tendered shares of Common Stock have not been subject to any substantial
risk of forfeiture) for at least six months prior to the date of exercise, and
(C)&nbsp;Common Stock must be delivered to the Company. Delivery for this purpose
may, at the election of the grantee, be made either by (A)&nbsp;physical delivery of

between the aggregate exercise price payable with respect to the option being
exercised and the Fair Market Value of the share(s) of Common Stock tendered in
payment (plus any applicable taxes) shall be paid in cash. No grantee may

fractional Shares) may be withheld in payment and (B)&nbsp;such grantee must present
evidence acceptable to the Company that he or she has owned a number of shares
of Common Stock at least equal to the number of Shares to be withheld in
payment of the exercise price (and that such owned shares of Common Stock have
not been subject to any substantial risk of forfeiture) for at least six months
prior to the date of exercise <B>. </B>When payment of the exercise price is made by
withholding of Shares, the difference, if any, between the aggregate exercise
price payable with respect to the option being exercised and the Fair Market
Value of the Share(s) withheld in payment (plus any applicable taxes) shall be
paid in cash. No grantee may authorize the withholding of Shares having a Fair
Market Value exceeding the aggregate exercise price payable with respect to the
option being exercised (plus any applicable taxes). Any withheld Shares shall
no longer be issuable under such option.

Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act ceases to be a director or officer of the
Company due to involuntary separation from the Company (other than

Stock of the Company on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price of the

which the SARs correspond. Prior to the exercise of the SAR and delivery of the
cash and/or Shares represented thereby, the participant shall have no rights as
a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by such outstanding SAR (including
any dividend or voting rights).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARs granted in tandem with options shall be exercisable only when, to the
extent and on the conditions that any related option is exercisable. The
exercise of an option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of any related

cause an immediate forfeiture of any related option to the extent the SAR is
exercised.

which the SAR is related, multiplied by the number of Shares as to which the
SAR is exercised (less any applicable taxes). The Committee shall decide
whether such distribution shall be in cash, in Shares having a Fair Market
Value equal to such amount, in Other Company Securities having a Fair Market
Value equal to such amount or in a combination thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All SARs will be exercised automatically on the last day prior to the
expiration date of the SAR or, in the case of SARs granted in tandem with
options, any related option, so long as the Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock on that date exceeds the exercise price of the SAR or any related
option, as applicable. A SAR granted in tandem with options shall expire at the

determine to constitute capital under Section&nbsp;154 of the Delaware General

Shares of restricted stock are treasury shares. Unless otherwise determined by
the Committee, certificates representing Shares of restricted stock granted
under the Plan will be held in escrow by the Company on the participant&#146;s
behalf during any period of restriction thereon and will bear an appropriate
legend specifying the applicable restrictions thereon, and the participant will
be required to execute a blank stock power therefor. Except as otherwise
provided by the Committee, during such period of restriction the participant
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Common Stock, including but not
limited to the rights to receive dividends and to vote, and any stock or other
securities received as a distribution with respect to such participant&#146;s

to be measured (a &#147;performance cycle&#148;), except that no performance cycle shall
be less than 12&nbsp;months in duration. Performance awards may include (i)&nbsp;specific
dollar-value target awards, (ii)&nbsp;performance units, the value of each such unit
being determined by the Committee at the time of issuance, and/or (iii)
performance Shares, the value of each such Share being equal to the Fair Market
Value of a share of Common Stock. The value of each performance award may be

the Company&#146;s performance for the relevant period: earnings per share (EPS);
net earnings; pre-tax earnings; earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT);
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); net
operating profit after tax (NOPAT)&nbsp;return on assets; return on equity; return
on net assets (RONA); return on investment; return on capital; total
shareholder return; stock price (and stock price appreciation, either in
absolute terms or in relationship to the appreciation among members of a peer
group to be determined by the Committee); revenues; comparable store sales;
cash flow; economic profit; and sales per square foot; inventory turnover and
strategic milestones. The performance objectives established by the Committee
for any performance cycle may be expressed in terms of attaining a specified
level of the performance objective or the attainment of a percentage increase
or decrease in the particular objective, and may involve comparisons with
respect to historical results of the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or
operating groups or segments thereof, all as the Committee deems appropriate.
The performance objectives established by the Committee for any performance
cycle may be applied to the performance of the Company relative to a market
index, a peer group of other companies or a combination thereof, all as
determined by the Committee for such performance cycle. The performance
objectives established by the Committee must preclude the discretion to
increase the amount of any incentive award payable to a Participant.

adjust the performance goals and objectives for such cycle for such reasons as
it deems equitable to the extent permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Specifically, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the method of
calculating attainment of performance goals and objectives for a performance
cycle as follows: (i)&nbsp;to exclude the dilutive effects of acquisitions or joint
ventures; (ii)&nbsp;to assume that any business divested by the Company achieved
performance objectives at targeted levels during the balance of a performance
cycle following such divestiture; (iii)&nbsp;to exclude restructuring and/or other
nonrecurring charges; (iv)&nbsp;to exclude exchange rate effects, as applicable, for
non-U.S. dollar denominated net sales and operating earnings; (v)&nbsp;to exclude
the effects of changes to generally accepted accounting standards required by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board; (vi)&nbsp;to exclude the effects to any
statutory adjustments to corporate tax rates; (vii)&nbsp;to exclude the impact of

provided by the Committee, (a)&nbsp;if a participant ceases to be a director,
officer or employee of, or to otherwise perform services for, the Company and

of restricted stock upon grant or vesting, as the case may be. Such election
must be made on or before the date the amount of tax to be withheld is

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of an employee from the Company to a Subsidiary, from a
Subsidiary to the Company, or from one Subsidiary to another shall not be
considered a termination of employment; nor shall it be considered a
termination of employment if an employee is placed on military, disability or
sick leave or such other leave of absence which is considered by the Committee
as continuing intact the employment relationship.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock
dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, distribution of assets,
or any other change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company, the
Committee shall make such adjustment as it deems appropriate in the number and
kind of Shares or other property reserved for issuance under the Plan, in the
number and kind of Shares or other property covered by grants previously made
under the Plan, and in the exercise price of outstanding options and SARs. Any
such adjustment shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes of the
Plan. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization in
which the Company is not the surviving or continuing corporation or in which a
Change in Control is to occur, all of the Company&#146;s obligations regarding
options, SARs performance awards, and restricted stock that were granted

the type specified by clause (iii)&nbsp;of the definition of a Change in Control in
Section&nbsp;2(c), the Committee may, in its discretion, (i)&nbsp;cancel any or all
outstanding options under the Plan in consideration for payment to the holders
thereof of an amount equal to the portion of the consideration that would have
been payable to such holders pursuant to such transaction if their options had
been fully exercised immediately prior to such transaction, less the aggregate
exercise price that would have been payable therefor, or (ii)&nbsp;if the amount
that would have been payable to the option holders pursuant to such transaction
if their options had been fully exercised immediately prior thereto would be
less than the aggregate exercise price that would have been payable therefor,
cancel any or all such options for no consideration or payment of any kind.
Payment of any amount payable pursuant to the preceding sentence may be made in
cash or, in the event that the consideration to be received in such transaction
includes securities or other property, in cash and/or securities or other

stockholders, may modify or terminate the Plan, except that no modification
shall become effective without prior approval of the stockholders of the
Company if stockholder approval would be required for continued compliance with
the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code or
any listing requirement of the principal stock exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed. With respect to International Participants, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan or any
Awards under the Plan with respect to such International Participants in order
to conform such terms to the requirements of local laws in the country in which
the International Participant resides or works.

appropriate (including, but not limited to, acceleration of the date of
exercise of any award and/or payments thereunder or of the date of lapse of
restrictions on Shares) in the event of a change in control or death,
disability, retirement of the participant, or other situation which the
Committee deems as a special circumstance; provided that, except as otherwise
provided in Section&nbsp;15, no such amendment shall adversely affect in a material
manner any right of a participant under the award without his or her written
consent. The Committee may, with the grantee&#146;s consent, cancel any award under
the Plan and issue a new award in substitution therefor upon such terms as the
Committee may in its sole discretion determine, provided that the substituted
award shall satisfy all applicable Plan requirements as of the date such new
award is made; and further provided, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Plan, that in no event shall an option or stock appreciation
right be granted in substitution for a previously granted option or stock
appreciation right, with the old award being canceled or surrendered as a
condition of receiving the new award, if the new award would have a lower
option exercise price or stock appreciation right appreciation base than the
award it replaces. The foregoing is not intended to prevent equitable
adjustment of awards upon the occurrence of certain events as herein provided,
for example, without limitation, adjustments pursuant to Section&nbsp;15.
