Board of Directors of Office Depot, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) has on the date hereof
granted to you a restricted stock award pursuant to the Office Depot, Inc.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). This restricted stock award
(your &#147;Award&#148;) relates to XXXXXX shares of the Company&#146;s common stock (&#147;Common
Stock&#148;). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given
to them in the Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Vesting. Your Award is subject to the following vesting restrictions:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;Your Award will vest XX percent on the XXXXX anniversary and XX percent
on the XXXXX anniversary of the date of this letter, provided that you remain
employed by the Company throughout the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the Vesting Date (the &#147;Vesting Period&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;Upon the receipt of a copy of this Agreement containing your signature,
the Company will register a certificate or certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock indicated above in your name (your &#147;Restricted Shares&#148;).
Restricted Shares shall bear a legend specifying that such shares are not
transferable and are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
of the Plan. If your employment with the Company terminates for any reason
(including your death) during the Vesting Period, your Restricted Shares will
be cancelled and you will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
or this Agreement. Restricted Shares will be held in escrow by the Company on
your behalf until the Restricted Shares vest or are forfeited.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;During the Vesting Period, while you are employed by the Company, you
will have the right to vote your Restricted Shares. If your Restricted Shares
are forfeited at any time during the Vesting Period, you will cease to have any
rights with respect to such forfeited shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;Within 45&nbsp;days after the vesting in full of your Award, the Company
will issue to you a certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
(your &#147;Vested Shares&#148;) in exchange for your Restricted Shares on a one-for-one
basis, and your Restricted Shares will be cancelled. Such Vested Shares will
not be subject to any restrictions under this Agreement, but

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">may be subject to certain restrictions under applicable securities laws and
such shares will bear a legend specifying any such restrictions.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Registration. The issuance of shares of Common Stock in payment of
your Award has been registered by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933
pursuant to an effective registration statement (&#147;Registration Statement&#148;). By
signing this Agreement you agree that you will not reoffer, resell or otherwise
dispose of any shares issued to you in payment of your Award in any manner
which would violate any federal or state securities law, and further agree to
reimburse the Company for any loss, damage or expense of any kind which it may
suffer by reason of any breach of such agreement. You further acknowledge that
the Company has no obligation to keep the Registration Statement effective or
current or to file or keep effective any current or other registration
statement concerning any shares subject to your award. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Committee may suspend the issuance of
stock in payment of your Award if it determines that securities exchange
listing or registration or qualification under any securities laws is required
in connection therewith and have not been completed on terms acceptable to the
Committee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Withholding. The Company may withhold, or require you to remit to the
Company, an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy any withholding or other tax
due under any federal, state, local, or foreign tax law with respect to any
amount payable and/or shares issuable pursuant to your Award, and the Committee
may defer such payment or issuance unless indemnified to its satisfaction. The
Committee may, in its sole discretion, satisfy any such withholding or other
tax obligation by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise
issuable to you pursuant to your Award.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;No Employment Rights. Nothing in the Plan or your Award shall serve to
modify or amend any employment agreement you may have with the Company or to
interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to
terminate your employment at any time, or confer upon you any right to continue
in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate for any period of time or to
continue your present or any other rate of compensation subject to the terms of
any employment agreement you may have with the Company. The grant of your
Award shall not give you any right to any additional awards under the Plan or
any other compensation plan the Company has adopted or may adopt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Conformance with Plan. This Agreement is intended to conform in all
respects with the Plan. Inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Plan
will be resolved in accordance with the terms of the Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Successors. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of any successor of the Company.
