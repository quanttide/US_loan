<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Dear First Name:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to advise you that the Compensation Committee of the
Company&#146;s Board of Directors has granted you a stock option as provided below,
pursuant to the Office Depot, Inc. Long-term Equity Incentive Plan (&#147;the
Plan&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1. Option



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your option is to purchase up to XXXX shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
(&#147;Option Shares&#148;), at an option price per share of $XX.XXX payable upon
exercise. Your option will expire at the close of business on X/X/XXXX (the
&#147;Expiration Date&#148;), subject to earlier expiration upon the termination of your
employment as provided below. Your option is (not)&nbsp;intended to be an
&#147;incentive stock option&#148; within meaning of Section&nbsp;422 of the Internal Revenue
Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option price of $XX.XXX per share reflects the fair market value of
the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">4. Procedure for Exercise



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may exercise all or any portion of your option, to the extent it has
become exercisable and is outstanding, at any time and from time to time prior
to its expiration, by delivering written notice to the Company and your written
acknowledgment that you have read, and have been afforded an opportunity to ask
questions of management of the Company regarding all financial and other
information provided to you regarding the Company, together with payment of the
option price pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Plan. As a condition to any
exercise of your option, you will permit the Company to deliver to you all
financial and other information regarding the Company it believes necessary to
enable you to make an informed investment decision.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">5. Securities Laws Restrictions and Other Restrictions on Transfer of Option
Shares



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You represent that when you exercise your option you will be purchasing
Option Shares for your own account and not on behalf of others. You understand
and acknowledge that federal and state securities laws govern and restrict your
right to offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Option Shares unless your
offer, sale or other disposition thereof is registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 (the &#147;1933 Act&#148;) and state securities laws, or in the opinion of the
Company&#146;s counsel, such offer, sale or other disposition is exempt from the
registration thereunder. Section&nbsp;18 of the Plan also describes other
restrictions on the transfer of Option Shares. You agree that you will not
offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Option Shares in any manner which
would: (i)&nbsp;require the Company to file any registration statement (or similar
filing under state law) with the Securities and Exchange Commission or to amend
or supplement any such filing, (ii)&nbsp;violate or cause the Company to violate the
1933 Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any other state
or federal law, or (iii)&nbsp;violate the restrictions contained in Section&nbsp;18 of
the Plan. You further understand that the certificates for any Option Shares
you purchase will bear such legends as the Company deems necessary or desirable
in connection with the 1933 Act or other rules, regulations or laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">6. Non-Transferability of Option



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your option is personal to you and is not transferable by you other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution. During your lifetime only you
(or your guardian or legal representative) can exercise your option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">7. Conformity with Plan



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your option is intended to conform in all respects with, and is subject
to, all applicable provisions of the Plan which is incorporated herein by
reference. Inconsistencies between this letter and the Plan shall be resolved
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. By executing and
