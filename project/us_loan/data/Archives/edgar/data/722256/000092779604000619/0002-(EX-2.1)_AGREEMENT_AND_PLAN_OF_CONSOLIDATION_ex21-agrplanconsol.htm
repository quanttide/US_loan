          Surviving Bank. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the certificate of
          incorporation and bylaws of the Merger Sub shall become the certificate of
          incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Bank, the officers and employees of
          the Merger Sub and the officers and employees of the Consolidated Bank shall be

          properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent by the
          Shareholder and accompanied by all the certificates representing the shares of
          NYNB Preferred Stock as to which the election is being made. Hudson Valley will
          have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange
          Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly completed,
          signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of Election.
          The good faith decision of Hudson Valley (or the Exchange Agent) in such
matters           shall be conclusive and binding, provided that Hudson Valley (and the
Exchange           Agent) does not act unreasonably. Neither Hudson Valley nor the
Exchange Agent           will be under any obligation to, but Hudson Valley and the
Exchange Agent may           (if they choose to do so), notify any person of any defect
in a Form of Election           submitted to the Exchange Agent. Hudson Valley and NYNB
shall each use its best           efforts to mail the Form of Election to all persons who
are holders of record of           NYNB Preferred Stock on the record date for the
Shareholders&#146; Meeting (as           hereinafter defined) at least the date fifteen
calendar days prior to the           anticipated Effective Time. A Form of Election must
be received by the Exchange           Agent by the close of business on the third
business day prior to the Closing in           order to be effective. All elections will
be irrevocable. Any holder of NYNB           Preferred Stock who fails to file a valid
election or fails to execute and           deliver the Investor Certificate to Hudson
Valley will be deemed to have elected           to receive $5.00 in cash.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

to the fullest extent           permitted by law. NYNB is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing           under the laws of the United States of America.
NYNB has the corporate power and           authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its           business as it is now being conducted
and is duly licensed or qualified to do           business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the           business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and           assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary,           except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would           not have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, assets or           financial condition of NYNB. The
<I><U>NYNB Disclosure Schedule </U></I>sets forth true and complete copies of the

Without limiting the foregoing, NYNB will send to           Hudson Valley a monthly list
of each new loan or extension of credit, and each           renewal of an existing loan
or extension of credit, in excess of $10,000, made           during such month, and

that NYNB believes that it has established all reserves and           taken all

hereto will promptly supplement or amend (by written notice to           the other) its
respective Disclosure Schedules delivered pursuant hereto with           respect to any
matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known           at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or           described in such
Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information in           such Schedules
which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. If the           disclosure
contained in any such supplement (i) relates to events occurring           before
execution of this Agreement or (ii) alone or together with other           supplements or

          representation. Notice of such determination, if made, shall be given by the
          receiving party to the other party not later than 15 days after it received the
          disclosure in question. If such notice is not timely given, or if the
disclosure           in question did not contain any matter of the nature specified in
clause (i) or           (ii) of the second preceding sentence, the relevant
representation shall be           deemed modified by the disclosure in the amendment or
supplement with the same           effect as though that disclosure had been included in
the relevant Disclosure           Schedule as furnished prior to execution of this
Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

NYNB. This consulting arrangement may be terminated without cause by Hudson Valley at any
