          further that NYNB shall not be required to prepare and file any such
          registration statement in connection with any proposed sale with respect to
          which counsel to NYNB delivers to NYNB and to Hudson Valley (which is reasonably
          acceptable to Hudson Valley) its opinion to the effect that no such filing is
          required under applicable laws and regulations with respect to such sale or
          disposition or any subsequent sale or disposition; provided further, however,
          that NYNB may delay any registration of Option Shares above for a period not
          exceeding 90 days in the event that NYNB shall in good faith determine that any
          such registration would adversely effect an on-going offering of securities by
          NYNB for cash. Hudson Valley shall provide all information reasonable requested
          by NYNB for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder.</FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Agreement" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with such filing, NYNB shall use its best efforts to cause to be delivered to
Hudson Valley such certificates, opinions, accountant&#146;s letters and other documents
as Hudson Valley shall reasonably request and as are customarily provided in connection
with registrations of securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. All
expenses incurred by NYNB in complying with the provisions of this Section 4, including
without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and
disbursements of counsel for NYNB and blue sky fees and expenses shall be paid by NYNB.
Underwriting discounts and commissions to brokers and dealers relating to the Option or
Option Shares, fees and disbursements of counsel to Hudson Valley and any other expenses
incurred by Hudson Valley in connection with such registration shall be borne by Hudson
Valley. In connection with such filing, NYNB shall indemnify and hold harmless Hudson
Valley against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
Hudson Valley may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any preliminary or final
registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and NYNB will reimburse Hudson Valley for any legal or other expense
reasonably incurred by Hudson Valley in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that NYNB
will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made in such preliminary or final registration statement
or such amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by or on behalf of Hudson Valley specifically for use in the
preparation thereof with respect to information about the selling stockholders or the plan
of distribution. Hudson Valley will indemnify and hold harmless NYNB to the same extent as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence but only with reference to written
information specifically furnished by or on behalf of Hudson Valley for use in the
preparation of such preliminary or final registration statement or such amendment or
supplement thereto with respect to information about the selling stockholders or the plan
of distribution; and Hudson Valley will reimburse NYNB for any legal or other expense
reasonably incurred by NYNB in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent. </FONT></P>
