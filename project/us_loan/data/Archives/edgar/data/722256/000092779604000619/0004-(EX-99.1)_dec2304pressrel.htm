<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YONKERS,
NY, December 24, 2004. The Board of Directors of Hudson Valley Holding Corp. (HUVL), the
parent company of Hudson Valley Bank with $1.9 billion in assets, announces that it has
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire New York National Bank, a Bronx based
community bank with $140 million in assets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New
York National Bank was founded in 1982 to operate as a community focused bank providing
deposit and lending services to residents, businesses and community organizations in the
South Bronx. It has expanded its market to several areas of the Bronx and upper Manhattan,
serviced through five branch locations. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William
E. Griffin, Chairman of Hudson Valley stated, &#147;This acquisition represents a
long-term strategic decision by Hudson Valley to increase its market penetration and
presence in these vibrant and growing communities in the Bronx and Manhattan. The addition
of New York National will assist us in achieving our overall growth and profitability
objectives and in remaining a financially strong independent bank. The acquisition
complements Hudson Valley Bank&#146;s continuing new branch expansion strategy which we
will aggressively pursue in 2005.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafin
U. Mariel, President of New York National Bank stated, &#147;We feel strongly that
partnering with Hudson Valley Bank will make us a stronger organization now and in the
future. Hudson Valley has a long history of servicing local communities and reinvesting in
those communities. With its two branches and over $80 million in loans in the Bronx,
Hudson Valley will strengthen our position in this core market. Like New York National,
Hudson Valley Bank specializes in providing a full range of financial services to
individuals, small businesses, professional service firms and not-for-profit organizations
in our local communities. Hudson Valley will bring additional capital, technology, and
resources necessary for us to create increased economic opportunity in our
communities.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James
J. Landy, President and CEO of Hudson Valley added, &#147;We believe the transaction will
add to net income during the first year of operation and as a result, increase shareholder
value. New York National Bank will retain its identity by operating as a wholly owned
state chartered bank subsidiary of Hudson Valley Holding Corp., and I will serve as
President and CEO. Serafin U. Mariel will continue with the bank to focus on business
development, expanding the bank&#146;s outreach and meeting the needs of the
community.&#148; </FONT></P>

regulatory approval and approval by New York National&#146;s shareholders. The company
anticipates that the transaction will be completed during the second quarter of 2005. </FONT></P>
