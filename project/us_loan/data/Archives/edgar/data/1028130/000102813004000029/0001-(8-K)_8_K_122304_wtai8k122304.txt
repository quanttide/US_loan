Item 5. Other Events.

     World Transport Authority, Inc. (WTAI), an Alberta, Canada, corporation
previously reported that WTAI will be temporarily suspended from trading
OTC.BB and will go to the pink sheets.  On December 16, 2004, William C.
Kennedy, CEO/Chairman and Charlotte Hassett, Esq. gave arguments as to why
World Transport Authority, Inc. was not able to meet its audit requirement as
stated in the November 8, 2004, 8k filing.   Mr. Kennedy and Ms. Hassett also
delivered a history synopsis to the Hearing Panel.

     On December 22, 2004, Chief Counsel Lanae Holbrook in a facsimile to Mr.
William C. Kennedy, CEO/Chairman, informed Mr. Kennedy pursuant to the
December 16, 2004, oral hearing before a Hearings Panel designated by the
NASD Board of Governor (the "Panel"), a determination has been made in the
matter of, World Transport Authority, Inc. (the "Company") and the Company's
request for the continued quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin
Board (the "OTCBB").   The company was previously notified that quotation of
its securities would cease due to the Company's failure to timely file its
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004) and its Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accordingly, the Panel determined that the Company's securities are not
eligible for the continued quotation on the OTCBB and, based on the filing
delinquency, to delete all quotations of the Company's securities on the
OTCBB effective with the open of business on Monday, December 27, 2004.  The
hearing file has been closed.

     The Company is aware, however, that the Listing and Hearing Review
Council (the "Listing Council") may, on its own motion, determine to review
any Panel decision within 45 calendar days after issuance of the written
decision.  If the listing Council determines to review this decision, it may
affirm, modify, reverse, dismiss, or remand the decision to the Panel.  The
Company will be immediately notified in the event the Listing Council
determines that this matter will be called for review.

     In the mean time, the Company is making efforts to come into compliance
concerning the audits.  Again, the reason for not getting the audits done in
a timely manner was expressed in the November 8, 2004, 8K filing.   The
management of WTAI has kept up with 8K required filings.  Even though the
company will be placed on the pink sheets for trading until the audits are
completed and WTAI is re-instated, World Transport Authority, Inc., an
Alberta corporation, its subsidiary Autotech International Corporation, a
Nevada corporation (AIC), and its subsidiary, Millennium Autotech
International Corporation, a Philippine corporation, will continue in day to
day business and operations.  WTAI will still file its complaint against Doug
Norman and former management as revealed in recent 8Ks.  Trading will
continue on the Pink Sheets.

     Because some financial institutions have not updated nor posted the 12-
08-04 WTAI 8K filing of the change of address and phone numbers of WTAI, an
Alberta corporation, we are again listing the new corporate address and phone
number of WTAI as:
