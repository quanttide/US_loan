<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHARTER FINANCIAL to pay $2.00 special Dividend</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>


<P>WEST POINT, Ga.,A December 23, 2004</B>--)<B> --- </B>Charter Financial Corporation <B>(Nasdaq: CHFN)</B> today announced that its board of directors the Company has declared </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>a a special</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> dividend of on the corporation's voting common stock $2.00 per share of common stock, payable February 1, 2005, to stockholders of record on as of January 14, 2005.</P>


</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>&quot;We believe our annualized dividend yield of around 3 percent-- based on recent closing prices--is one of the more attractive in our industry and reflects Charter Financial's goal of building shareholder value,&quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;This $2.00 special dividend is a major step in managing our capital position.&quot; said Robert L. Johnson, president and chief executive officer. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>&quot;This relatively high yield is made possible in part by our unique mutual holding company structure in which the MHC owns 80 percent of the CHFN shares but has waived its right to receive dividends. That enables us to pay higher dividends to the holders of the publicly traded 20 percent than might otherwise have been possible.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Managing our capital position, in part through our dividend policy, is a key component of Charter Financial's three-part strategy of providing value to stockholders, which also includes bui
lding our retail franchise and managing our investment in Freddie Mac stock.&quot;</P>


</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>&quot;This dividend policy is a component of managing our capital position, one element in our strategy to provide value to stockholders,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;This strategy also includes building our retail franchise and managing our investment in Freddie Mac stock.&quot;</P>
