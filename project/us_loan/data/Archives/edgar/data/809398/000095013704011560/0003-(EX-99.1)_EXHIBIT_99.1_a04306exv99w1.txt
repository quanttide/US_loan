regulation to which such Stockholder is subject, (ii) violate any order,

                         VOTING AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

                  2.1 Election of Directors; Committees.

                  (a) Each Person, other than the Company, that is a party to
this Agreement hereby agrees that such Person will vote, or cause to be voted,
all voting Shares of the Company over which such Person has the power to vote or
direct the voting, and will take all other necessary or desirable actions within

and cause to be continued in office, the following individuals, in each case
subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b) below:

                  (i)      one (1) director designated by Thomas H. Lee Equity
                           Fund V, L.P. and one (1) director designated by
                           Thomas H. Lee Parallel Fund V, L.P. (collectively,
                           the "THL Directors"), who shall initially be Thomas
                           M. Hagerty and Seth Lawry and who shall be such
                           directors so long as they

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

                           are principals of THL (or equivalent or higher
                           ranking employees of THL), provided that any
                           directors replacing the initial THL Directors shall
                           always be individuals who are principals of THL (or
                           equivalent or higher ranking employees of THL);

                  (ii)     two (2) directors designated by TPG Partners IV, L.P.
                           (the "TPG Directors"), who shall initially be
                           Jonathan Coslet and Marshall Haines and who shall be
                           such directors so long as they are principals of TPG
                           (or equivalent or higher ranking employees of TPG),
                           provided that any directors replacing the initial TPG
                           Directors shall always be individuals who are
                           principals of TPG (or equivalent or higher ranking
                           employees of TPG) ; and

                  (iii)    up to twelve (12) directors designated by Parent
                           representing the proportional amount of Shares held
                           by Parent at the relevant time (the "Parent
                           Directors"); provided that, it is acknowledged that
                           any number of the director seats to be filled by the
                           Parent at any time may remain vacant until such time
                           as the Parent elects to fill such seats.

                  (b) If at any time THL or TPG ceases to own at least 50% of
the Shares held by it as of the date hereof (subject to adjustment for stock
splits, combinations and similar events), the number of directors THL or TPG, as
the case may be, is entitled to designate shall be decreased by one. In the
event such decrease results in an undesignated Board seat, the remaining Board
members may designate, by majority vote, a successor director to fill the
vacancy created thereby or decrease the size of the Board by such seats.

                  (c) The chairman of the Board (the "Chairman") shall be
elected by a majority vote of the Board; provided, however, that William P.
Foley, II shall serve as the Chairman for an initial period of three (3) years
provided he continues to be employed by the Company as Chief Executive Officer.

                  (d) The Board shall hold no less than one (1) meeting per
fiscal quarter. At each meeting of the Board (or committee thereof) at which a
quorum is present, each director shall be entitled to one vote on each matter to
be voted on at such meeting. A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum.

                  (e) If at any time any director ceases to serve on the Board
(whether due to resignation, removal or otherwise), the Stockholders shall elect
a successor to fill the vacancy created thereby on the terms and subject to the
conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above. Each Person that is a party hereto
agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all voting Shares of the Company over
which such Person has the power to vote or direct the voting, and shall take all
such other actions as shall be necessary or desirable to cause the designated
successor to be elected to fill such vacancy.

                  (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impair any
rights that the stockholders of the Company may have to remove any director for
cause under applicable law,

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

the certificate of incorporation of the Company, or the by-laws of the Company,
as the case may be. No such removal of an individual designated pursuant to this
Section 2.1 for cause shall affect any of the Stockholders' rights to designate
a different individual pursuant to this Section 2.1 to fill the position from
which such individual was removed.

                  (g) Each member of the Board shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Company for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including travel) incurred in attending any Board meeting.

                  (h) For so long as a Sponsor has any designees on the Board,
the Company shall obtain and maintain directors and officers liability insurance
with coverage of at least $50,000,000 and of a scope that is customary for
companies equivalent to the Company in terms of size and industry. The Company
shall indemnify the directors designated by the Sponsors in accordance with the
Company's certificate of incorporation and each indemnification agreement
entered into by the Company and such director.

                  (i) There shall be established at all times during the term of
this Agreement a Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation
Committee") which shall be comprised of up to five (5) directors as follows: one
(1) of whom shall be one of the THL Directors, one (1) of whom shall be one of
the TPG Directors and three (3) of whom shall be Parent Directors, provided
that, one (1) of the Parent Directors shall be an independent director selected
by Parent who shall not be an employee of Parent. The Compensation Committee
will (i) determine the compensation of all senior employees and consultants of
the Company (including salary, bonus, equity participation and benefits)
consistent with compensation of companies similar to the Company and (ii)
approve the grants of any options under, or amendments to or replacement of, the
Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan; provided that no member of the
Compensation Committee may vote on his own compensation or option grant. The
initial members of the Compensation Committee shall be William P. Foley, II,
Thomas M. Hagerty and Jonathan Coslet and two other individuals designated by
Parent in accordance with the provisions in this clause (i).

                  (j) There shall be established at all times during the term of
this Agreement an Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") which
shall be comprised of THL Directors, TPG Directors and Parent Directors
representing the proportional amount of Shares held by THL, TPG and Parent,
respectively. The Audit Committee shall determine the Company's audit policies,
review audit reports and recommendations made by the Company's internal audit
staff and its independent auditors, meet with the Company's independent
auditors, oversee the independent auditors, and recommend the Company's
engagement of independent auditors.

                  (k) All other committees that may be established by the Board
from time to time shall be comprised of up to five (5) directors as follows: one
(1) of whom shall be one of the THL Directors, one (1) of whom shall be one of
the TPG Directors and three (3) of whom shall be Parent Directors, provided
that, one (1) of the Parent Directors shall be an independent director selected
by Parent who shall not be an employee of Parent.

or otherwise in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement.

                  (b) No Transfer of any Shares by any Stockholder shall become
effective unless and until the Transferee (unless such Transferee already is
party to this Agreement) executes and delivers to the Company a counterpart to
this Agreement, agreeing to be treated in the same manner as the transferring
Stockholder. Upon such Transfer and such execution and delivery, the Transferee
acquiring Transferred Shares shall be bound by, and entitled to the benefits of,
this Agreement in the same manner as the transferring Stockholder; provided that
no Transferee of a Sponsor (other than pursuant to the second sentence of the
definition of an Exempt Transfer) shall be entitled to any of the rights of the
Sponsor set forth in this Agreement (or the benefits hereunder) other than
Section 3.2, Article V, Article VI, Section 7.2, Article VIII and Article IX
hereof. Any attempted Transfer of Shares by any Stockholder not in accordance
with this Section 3.1 shall not be effective and shall be void.

                  (c) No Shares may be transferred by a Stockholder (other than
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act) unless
such Stockholder first delivers to the Company an opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the
effect that such Transfer is not required to be registered under the Securities
Act.

                  3.2      Tag-Along Rights.

                  (a) At any time after the date of this Agreement, if any
Sponsor or Parent (the "Selling Holder") proposes to Transfer any such Shares to
a third party, the Selling Holder shall, before such Transfer:

                  (i)      Deliver to the Company and to the other Stockholders
                           (the "Other Holders") at least thirty (30) days prior
                           written notice of such proposed Transfer (the "Sale
                           Notice") and the terms of such Transfer, including
                           (A) the number of shares of Common Stock to which the
                           Transfer relates (the "Offered Shares"), (B) the name
                           and address of the proposed Transferee, (C) the
                           proposed amount and type of consideration (including,
                           if the consideration consists in whole or in part of
                           non-cash consideration, such information available to
                           the Selling Holder as may be reasonably necessary for
                           the other Stockholders to properly analyze the
                           economic value and investment risk of such non-cash
                           consideration) and the terms and conditions of
                           payment proposed by the Selling Holder.

                  (ii)     Any of the Other Holders may, within twenty-five (25)
                           days of the receipt of the Sale Notice, give written
                           notice (each, a "Tag-Along Notice") to the Selling
                           Holder that such Other Holder wishes to participate
                           in such proposed Transfer upon the terms and
                           conditions set forth in the Sale Notice, which
                           Tag-Along Notice shall specify the Shares such Other
                           Holder desires to include in such proposed Transfer;
                           provided, however, that (1) each Other Holder shall
                           be required, as a condition to being permitted to
                           sell Shares pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) in
                           connection with a Transfer of Offered Shares, to sell
                           a number of shares equal to the product of its Pro
                           Rata Amount and the number of Offered Shares, (2) to
                           exercise its tag-along rights hereunder, each Other
                           Holder must agree to make to the Transferee on behalf
                           of itself the same representations, warranties,
                           covenants, indemnities and agreements as the Selling
                           Holder agrees to make in connection with the Transfer
                           of the Offered Shares (except that in the case of
                           representations and warranties pertaining
                           specifically to, or covenants made specifically by,
                           the Selling Holder, the Other Holders shall make
                           comparable representations and warranties pertaining
                           specifically to (and, as applicable, covenants by)
                           themselves), and must agree to bear its ratable share
                           (which shall be proportionate based on the value of
                           Shares that are Transferred) of all liabilities to
                           the Transferees arising out of representations,
                           warranties (other than those representations,

                           agreements made in connection with the Transfer. Each
                           Stockholder will bear (x) its own costs of any sale
                           of Shares pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) and (y) its
                           pro-rata share (based upon the relative amount of
                           Shares sold) of any of the other costs of any
                           reasonable and customary sale of Shares pursuant to
                           this Section 3.2(a) to the extent such costs are
                           incurred for the benefit of all Stockholders and are
                           not otherwise paid by the Transferee.

                  (b) If none of the Other Holders gives the Selling Holder a
Tag-Along Notice prior to the expiration of the 25-day period for giving
Tag-Along Notices with respect to the Transfer proposed in the Sale Notice, then
(notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 3.2(a)) the Selling Holder
may Transfer such Offered Shares on the terms and conditions set forth, and to
or among any of the Transferees identified (or Affiliates of Transferees
identified), in the Sale Notice at any time within ninety (90) days after
expiration of the 25-day period for giving Tag-Along Notices with respect to
such Transfer. Any such Offered Shares not Transferred by the Selling Holder
during such 90-day period will again be subject to the provisions of this
Section 3.2(a) upon subsequent Transfer. If one or more Other Holders give the
Selling Holder a timely Tag-Along Notice, then the Selling Holder shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of the prospective Transferee(s) to
the participation of the Other Holders in any contemplated Transfer, on the same
terms and conditions as are applicable to the Offered Shares, and no Selling
Holder shall transfer any of its shares to any prospective Transferee if such
prospective Transferee(s) declines to allow the participation of the Other
Holders.

                  (c) The rights and restrictions contained in Section 3.2(a)
shall not apply with respect to any Exempt Transfer.

                  3.3 Transfers in Violation of Agreement. Any Transfer or
attempted Transfer of any Shares in violation of any provision of this Agreement
shall be void, and the Company shall not record such Transfer on its books or
treat any purported transferee of such Shares as the owner of such Shares for
any purpose.

                                 LIQUIDTY RIGHTS

                  4.1 Duty to Negotiate; Appraisal.

                  (a) If the Sponsors shall have cooperated with the Company in
its efforts to consummate a Qualified Public Offering but the Company has not
consummated a Qualified Public Offering prior to the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, then, at any time thereafter, Sponsors holding at least 75% of the
Sponsor Shares (the "Sponsor Group") may give notice (the "Transfer Notice") to
Parent that the Sponsor Group desires to sell their Shares to Parent. For a
period of 30 days from the date of the Transfer Notice, each party will
negotiate in good faith regarding a sale of all the Sponsor Shares to the Parent
or the Company. If the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of a sale of
the Sponsor Shares to the Parent or the Company within such

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

30-day period, then the Sponsors may elect to initiate the Appraisal Process to
determine the Appraisal Price (the "Election"). Any Appraisal Process shall be
initiated by the Sponsor Group by delivering to Parent and the Company the
report of the first appraiser.

                  (b) If, following the first Appraisal Process, the Sponsor
Group is not satisfied in its sole discretion, with the Appraisal Price (which
determination it shall make within fifteen (15) days of completion of the
Appraisal Process), then it may elect (the "Second Election") to initiate the
Appraisal Process a second time; provided that the Sponsor Group may not make a
Second Election within 12 months of the Election. If, following the second
Appraisal Process, the Sponsor Group is not satisfied in its sole discretion,
with the Appraisal Price (which determination it shall make within fifteen (15)
days of completion of the Appraisal Process), then it may elect to initiate the
Appraisal Process a third time (the "Third Election"), provided that, the
Sponsor Group may not make a Third Election within 12 months of the Second
Election. The Sponsors may not initiate the Appraisal Process more than three
times.

                  (c) If, following any Appraisal Process, the Sponsor Group is
satisfied, in its sole discretion, with the Appraisal Price, the Sponsor Group
shall so notify the Parent and the Company and the Parent or the Company may
elect, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice of the Sponsor Group's
approval of the Appraisal Price, in its sole discretion, to purchase for cash
all of the Sponsor Shares from the Sponsors at the Appraisal Price by sending
written notice to the Sponsors, and, in such event, the Sponsors shall sell all
the Sponsor Shares to the Company and/or Parent. The closing of the purchase of
the Shares from the Sponsors by the Company and/or Parent pursuant to this
Section 4.1(c) shall occur no later than 30 days after notice of the Company or
Parent's election to purchase.

                  (d) If the Sponsor Group, in its sole discretion, has approved
an Appraisal Price, but the Company and Parent elect not to purchase the
Sponsors' Shares or fail to make an election within the 15-day time period
referenced in clause (c) above, then the Sponsors shall have the right to compel
a Sale of the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(e) (the "Sale Process").

                  (e) In accordance with Section 4.1(d) above, the Sponsor Group
may elect to compel a Sale of the Company in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 4.1(e) by providing written notice thereof to the Company.

                  (i)      The Stockholders and the Company promptly after
                           receiving such notice will take, under the direction
                           of the Sponsor Group, all actions reasonably
                           necessary or desirable and will use their reasonable
                           best efforts to cause the consummation of such Sale
                           of the Company at the highest value reasonably
                           available. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each
                           of Parent and the Company shall provide the Sponsors
                           with prompt notice regarding any and all approvals,
                           consents, notifications, waivers and other legal
                           requirements applicable to it and necessary for the
                           consummation of the proposed Sale of the Company, and
                           shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
                           such approvals, consents, notifications and waivers,
                           and comply with all such other legal requirements in
                           a timely fashion, (ii) the Company shall hire an

                           otherwise facilitate a Sale of the Company, (iii) if
                           the proposed Sale of the Company is structured as a
                           sale of assets or a merger or consolidation, or
                           otherwise requires equityholder approval, subject to

                           discretion, the Stockholders and the Company will
                           vote or cause to be voted all Shares that they hold
                           or with respect to which such Stockholder has the
                           power to direct the voting and which are entitled to
                           vote on such transaction in favor of such transaction
                           and will waive any appraisal rights which they may
                           have in connection therewith, and (iv) subject to the
                           provisions of 4.1(e)(iii) and to the approval of the
                           Sale of the Company by the Sponsor Group, in its sole
                           discretion, if the proposed Sale of the Company is
                           structured as or involves a sale or redemption of
                           Shares, the Stockholders will agree to sell their
                           pro-rata share of the Shares being sold in such Sale
                           of the Company on the terms and conditions approved
                           by such Sponsor Group, and the Stockholders and the
                           Company will execute any merger, asset purchase,
                           security purchase, recapitalization or other sale
                           agreement approved by such Sponsor Group (the
                           "Definitive Sale Agreements"), and will make to the
                           buyer the same representations, warranties,
                           covenants, indemnities and agreements (other than
                           non-competition agreements) as the Sponsor Group
                           makes in connection with such Sale of the Company
                           (except that in the case of representations and
                           warranties pertaining specifically to, or covenants
                           made specifically by, the Sponsor Group, the other
                           Stockholders shall make comparable representations
                           and warranties pertaining specifically to (and, as
                           applicable, covenants by) themselves), and must agree
                           to bear its ratable share (which shall be
                           proportionate based on the value of Shares that are
                           being sold in such Sale of the Company) of all
                           liabilities of the Stockholders arising out of
                           representations, warranties (other than those
                           representations, warranties and covenants that
                           pertain specifically to a given Stockholder),
                           covenants, indemnities or other agreements made in
                           the Definitive Sale Agreements.

                  (ii)     The obligations of the Stockholders with respect to
                           the Sale of the Company are subject to the
                           satisfaction of the following conditions: (A) upon
                           the consummation of the Sale of the Company, all of
                           the holders of a particular class or series of Shares
                           shall receive the same form and amount of
                           consideration per share, or amount of Shares, or if
                           any holders of a particular class or series of Shares
                           are given an option as to the form and amount of
                           consideration to be received, all holders of such
                           class or series will be given the same option, and
                           (B) all holders of vested and exercisable rights to
                           acquire a particular class or series of Shares will
                           be given an opportunity to either (1) exercise such
                           rights prior to the consummation of the Sale of the
                           Company and participate in such sale as holders of
                           such Shares or (2) upon the consummation of the Sale
                           of the Company, receive in exchange for such rights
                           consideration equal to the

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

                           amount determined by multiplying (x) the same amount
                           of consideration per share, or amount of Shares
                           received by the holders of such type and class of
                           Shares in connection with the Sale of the Company
                           less the exercise price per share, or amount of such
                           rights to acquire such Shares by (y) the number of
                           shares, or aggregate amount of Shares represented by
                           such rights.

                  (iii)    Each Stockholder will bear its or his pro-rata share
                           (based upon the relative amount of Shares sold) of
                           the reasonable and customary costs of any Sale of the
                           Company to the extent such costs are incurred for the
                           benefit of all Stockholders and are not otherwise
                           paid by the Company or the acquiring party.

                  (iv)     In no event will the auction process take more than
                           180 days (the "Auction Period"), unless Definitive
                           Sale Agreements have been entered into prior to the
                           end of the Auction Period. Unless Definitive Sale
                           Agreements have previously been executed, the Sponsor
                           Group shall have the right to terminate the Sale
                           Process at any time during the Auction Period in its
                           sole discretion (the "Sale Termination Right"). If
                           (i) the Sponsor Group exercises the Sale Termination
                           Right, or (ii) the Sale of the Company as
                           contemplated by the Definitive Sale Agreements is not
                           consummated (unless the failure to consummate is the
                           result of a breach of the Definitive Agreements by a
                           member of the Sponsor Group), then, at any time on or
                           after 6 months after the date on which the Sponsor
                           Group exercised the Sale Termination Date or the
                           Definitive Sale Agreements terminated in accordance
                           with their terms, as the case may be, the Sponsor
                           Group may, again initiate their liquidity rights
                           under this Article IV (commencing with Section
                           4.1(a)), subject to the terms of Section 4.1(b). If,
                           (i) at the end of the Auction Period, there is no
                           good faith, bona fide offer to acquire the Company,
                           or (ii) the shareholders of Parent have the right to
                           approve the Sale of the Company and vote against such
                           transaction, then , the Sponsor Group may, in its
                           sole discretion, either (i) exercise the exchange
                           rights described in Section 4.2, or (ii) again and at
                           any time initiate their liquidity rights under this
                           Article IV (commencing with Section 4.1(a)), subject
                           to the terms of Section 4.1(b).

                  4.2      Exchange Rights.

         If a Sale of the Company does not occur in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.1(c), then the Sponsor Group may elect to exchange all,
but not less than all, of the Sponsor Shares for shares of common stock of
Parent based upon the Appraisal Price of the Sponsor shares pursuant to a new
Appraisal Process initiated at the time the Sponsor Group elects to exercise
their exchange rights hereunder and the fair market value of the Parent's common
stock determined by the average closing price of the Parent's common stock for
the 45-day trading period immediately prior to the date of the exchange for
Parent common stock (the "Exchange"). To the extent the number of shares to be
received by Purchasers at the Appraisal Price constitutes

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

more than 19.9% of the outstanding capital stock of Parent (as determined
pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), then Purchasers will
receive the balance in cash as a pro rata portion of the Appraisal Price. Upon
written notice to Parent and the Company of the Sponsor Group's election to
consummate such Exchange (the "Exchange Notice"), each of Parent and the Company
shall (i) provide the Sponsors with prompt notice regarding any and all
approvals, consents, notifications, waivers, filings, amendments and other legal
requirements applicable to it and necessary for the consummation of the proposed
Exchange, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all such
approvals, consents, notifications, waivers, filings and amendments and shall
comply with all such other legal requirements in a timely fashion, and (ii) take
all other actions reasonably necessary or desirable and use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the consummation of the Exchange.

                                   ARTICLE V
                                REDEMPTION RIGHTS

                  5.1 Redemption of Sponsor Shares. At any time prior to a
Public Offering becoming effective:

                  (a) Parent shall provide the Sponsors with no less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice of any event that will constitute a Parent Change
of Control. If the Sponsor Group gives notice of its election (such election to
be called the "Redemption Notice") within twenty (20) days after receipt of such
notice from the Parent, to have the Company redeem its Shares, then, upon
consummation of such Parent Change of Control (the "Redemption Date"), the
Company shall be required to redeem, at the Redemption Price (as defined below),
all of the Shares then held by the Sponsors (the "Redemption Shares"). The
Redemption Notice must request redemption of all, and not less than all, of the
Shares held by the Sponsors.

                  (b) For purposes of this provision, a "Parent Change of
Control" shall be deemed to have occurred when there has occurred (i) an
acquisition by any "person" (as that term is used in Sections 13(d)(3) and
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (or any
successor item, regulation or act to the same effect)) of beneficial ownership,
directly or indirectly, of securities of Parent representing more than fifty
percent (50%) of the combined voting power of Parent's then outstanding
securities; (ii) an acquisition by any "person" (as that term is used in
Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") (or any successor item, regulation or act to the same effect))
of the right to appoint a majority of Parent's board of directors; or (iii) the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent.

                  (c) The redemption price for each Redemption Share (the
"Redemption Price") shall be the Appraisal Price of each share of the Company's
Common Stock on the date that the applicable Redemption Notice is first given
under Section 5.1 (the "Determination Date").

                  (d) In consideration of the redemption of the Redemption
Shares hereunder, the Company shall deliver to the Sponsors on the Redemption
Date, the Redemption Price, in cash by certified check or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

<PAGE>

                  5.2 Redemption Closing. The closing of the redemption of the
Redemption Shares being redeemed by the Sponsors (the "Redemption Closing")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 100
Federal Street, Boston, MA 02110 on the applicable Redemption Date, or at such
other time and place as the Sponsors and the Company may agree. The Sponsors
shall deliver to the Company at the Closing a certificate or certificates
evidencing the Shares redeemed hereunder together with executed stock powers.

                  5.3 Failure to Redeem. If the Company fails to redeem all of
the Redemption Shares on the Redemption Date, then the Company shall be deemed
to have breached Section 5.1 hereof. If the Company's breach is due to
insufficient funds, then those funds which are available to the Company will be
used to redeem, pro rata, based on the aggregate Redemption Price, the maximum
possible number of Redemption Shares. In the event of such a breach, in addition
to any other remedies available to the Sponsors at law or in equity, between the
Redemption Date and such time as the redemption is completed, the Redemption
Price shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum,
compounded annually; provided that such rate shall increase by 2% on the date
that is six (6) months after the Redemption Date, and subject to applicable law,
shall further increase by an additional 2% on the last day of every quarter
thereafter, until such Redemption Shares are fully redeemed. If the Company
redeems fewer than all of the Redemption Shares offered for redemption, the
holders of the Shares not redeemed shall continue to receive the benefit of the
rights and privileges afforded the Shares hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                               PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

                  6.1      Issuance of New Shares.

                                    i. Purchase Rights. If at any time after the
                           date of this Agreement the Company proposes to issue
                           or sell any Common Stock, Common Stock Equivalents or
                           securities convertible into equity securities of the
                           Company (collectively, "New Shares"), the Company
                           shall first offer to sell to each Stockholder a
                           portion of each type of such New Shares equal to the
                           quotient determined by dividing (x) the number of
                           Shares held, beneficially owned by such Stockholder,
                           by (y) the total number of Shares outstanding
                           immediately prior to such issuance or sale. A
                           Stockholder shall be entitled to purchase all or any
                           portion of their respective portions (as determined
                           in the immediately preceding sentence) of such New
                           Shares at the most favorable price and on the most
                           favorable terms as such New Shares are to be offered.
                           The holders of Shares shall further have a right of
                           over-allotment such that to the extent a Stockholder
                           (a "Rejecting Holder") does not does not exercise its
                           right to purchase any of the New Shares, or exercises
                           its rights for less than all of its pro rata share of
                           the New Shares (as determined above), then each other
                           Stockholder may elect to purchase its pro rata share
                           (as determined above) of such New Shares which the
                           Rejecting Holder does not elect to purchase.

                                    ii. Offer Period. In order to exercise its
                           purchase rights hereunder, each Stockholder must,

                           Shares being offered, the purchase price thereof, the
                           payment terms, the percentage of the New Shares
                           initially available to such holder pursuant to
                           Section 5.1(a) and the over-allotment right available
                           in connection therewith, deliver a written notice to
                           the Company describing its election to exercise its
                           purchase rights hereunder.

                                    iii. Expiration of Offer Period. Upon the
                           expiration of the offering periods described above,
                           the Company shall be entitled to sell such New Shares
                           which the Stockholders have not elected to purchase
                           during the 180 days following such expiration on
                           terms and conditions no more favorable to the
                           purchasers thereof than those offered to the
                           Stockholders of Stock. Any New Shares to be sold by
                           the Company after such 180-day period must be
                           reoffered to the Stockholders pursuant to the terms
                           of this Section 6.1.

                                    iv. Exceptions to Purchase Rights. The
                           provisions of this Section 6.1 will not apply to the

operations of the Company and at the same time as Board members and shall be
entitled to participate in discussions and consult with, and make proposals and
furnish advice to, the Board or committee without voting; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be under any obligation to take any action with
respect to any proposals made or advice furnished by the Non-Voting Observer,
and nothing herein shall prevent the Board (or any committee thereof) from
acting by written instrument to the extent permitted by applicable law. The
Non-Voting Observer shall have a duty of confidentiality to the Company
comparable to the duty of confidentiality of a director of the Company.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an issue is to be
discussed or otherwise arises at any meeting of the Board or any committee of
the Board which, in the reasonable judgment of the Board or a majority of the
members of such committee, based on advice of legal counsel, cannot be discussed
in the presence of the Non-Voting Observer in order to avoid a conflict of
interest on the part of the Non-Voting Observer or to preserve an
attorney-client or accountant-client or any other available privilege, then such
issue may be discussed without the Non-Voting Observer being present and may be
deleted from any materials being distributed in connection with any meeting at
which such issues are to be discussed, so long as the Non-Voting Observer is
given notice of the occurrence of such meeting and the deletion of such
materials.

                  (d) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, upon
reasonable notice at reasonable times from time to time, at the sole expense of
the Affected Sponsor, provide the Affected Sponsor (and any other parent company
of the Affected Sponsor that is a venture capital operating company) reasonable
opportunities to routinely consult with and advise the management of the Company
and its subsidiaries on all matters relating to the operation of the Company and
each such Subsidiary. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to
give, subject to compliance with applicable laws and confidentiality obligations
to third parties, the Affected Sponsor (and any other parent company of the
Affected Sponsor that is a venture capital operating company) and their
authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all
books of account, facilities and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries
and permit the Affected Sponsor (and any parent company of the Affected Sponsor
that is a venture capital operating company) to make such copies and inspections
thereof as any such Person may reasonably request and discuss the affairs,
finances and accounts with the officers thereof; provided that the Affected
Sponsor shall not exercise such rights more often than two times during any
calendar year, and such additional times as may be reasonably required in order
to qualify any of the Shares as a venture capital investment (as defined in the
Department of Labor Regulation Sction. 2510.3-101). Any such visit will be at
the expense of the Affected Sponsor (or such other parent company of the
Affected Sponsor that is a venture capital operating company).

                  (e) If (i) reasonably required, in order to qualify any of the
Shares as a venture capital investment (as defined in the Department of Labor
Regulation Section 2510.3-101) or (ii) the

                                      -16-

Affected Sponsor is unable for any reason to appoint a Non-Voting Observer to
the Board (and each of the committees, except the compensation committee,
thereof), then the Company shall promptly provide true and correct copies of all
documents, reports, financial data, and such additional financial and other
information with respect to the Company, and its subsidiaries as the Affected
Sponsor (and any other parent company of the Affected Sponsor that is a venture
capital operating company) may from time to time reasonably request.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  9.1 Certain Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth or as referenced below:

                  "Affiliate" of any particular Person means any other Person
Controlling, Controlled by or under common Control with such particular Person
or, in the case of a natural Person, any other member of such Person's Family
Group.

                  "Agreement" has the meaning set forth in the preamble.

                  "Appraisal Price" means the "fair market value" of each Share
determined in accordance with this definition by one or more of the following
independent investment banking firms (the "Firms") acting as an appraiser (an
"Appraiser"): Bank of America Securities, LLC, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley,
provided that if all such Firms have been exhausted by either having already
rendered a valuation or the Sponsor Group or Parent has approached such Firms to
engage them and such Firms have declined such engagement, then the parties will
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree upon another
independent, nationally recognized investment banking firm. Each party who
selects an Appraiser must make such selection within fifteen (15) days of the
event triggering the Appraisal. Each party selecting an Appraiser hereunder
shall direct the Appraiser to deliver its valuation within thirty (30) days of
being retained, and such party shall cooperate with the Appraiser and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such valuation to be delivered within such time
frame. The expenses of any Appraiser engaged in connection with the Appraisal
Process shall be divided evenly among the parties. The Appraisal Price shall be
determined as follows:

                  (a)      Each Appraiser retained hereunder shall determine the
                           fair market per share value of the Sponsor Shares
                           assuming the sale of the entire equity interest of

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

                           the Company to an independent willing buyer in an
                           arms'-length transaction under then current
                           prevailing market conditions for the sale of all of
                           the stock of comparable business enterprises intended
                           for continued use as part of a going concern. Each
                           Appraiser shall assume that in any such transaction
                           each shareholder of the Company would receive the
                           same per share consideration, and the Appraiser shall
                           not apply any discount for minority interest or
                           illiquidity of the Sponsor Shares, nor any control
                           premium.

                  (b)      The initial Appraiser shall be selected by the
                           Sponsor Group (the "Sponsor Appraiser"). If the
                           Parent does not accept the per share valuation
                           arrived at by the Sponsor Appraiser, then the Parent
                           shall promptly notify THL and TPG thereof and Parent
                           shall retain one of the Firms as a second Appraiser
                           (the "Parent Appraiser").

                  (c)      If a valuation is delivered by the Parent Appraiser
                           in accordance with paragraph (b), and the Parent
                           Appraiser and the Sponsor Appraiser arrive at per
                           share valuations (the "Initial Valuations") within
                           ten percent (10%) of each other, the mathematical
                           mean of the Initial Valuations shall be deemed to be
                           the Appraisal Price. If such Appraisers shall arrive
                           at Initial Valuations that are not within ten percent
                           (10%) of each other but are within twenty percent
                           (20%) of each other, then the Parent Appraiser and
                           the Sponsor Appraiser, as soon as reasonably
                           practicable, shall jointly retain a Firm to act as a
                           third Appraiser (the "Third Appraiser") on reasonable
                           terms agreed to by the Sponsor Group and Parent in
                           good faith. In the event the valuation of the Third
                           Appraiser is greater than the higher of the Initial
                           Valuations, then the Appraisal Price shall be the
                           higher of the Initial Valuations. In the event the
                           valuation of the Third Appraiser is less than the
                           lower of the Initial Valuations, the Appraisal Price
                           shall be the lower of the Initial Valuations. If the
                           valuation of the Third Appraiser is not greater than
                           the higher of the Initial Valuations or lower than
                           the lower of the Initial Valuations, the Appraisal
                           Price shall be the mathematical mean of (i) the per
                           share valuation arrived at by the Third Appraiser,
                           and (ii) the Initial Valuation that is closest to
                           that of the per share valuation arrived at by the
                           Third Appraiser.

                  (d)      If the Initial Valuations are not within twenty
                           percent (20%) of each other, then neither valuation
                           shall be used and the Sponsor Group will retain a new
                           Firm to act as Sponsor Appraiser (the "Second Sponsor
                           Appraiser") and Parent shall retain a new Firm to act
                           as Parent Appraiser (the "Second Parent Appraiser").
                           If the per share valuations arrived at by the Second
                           Sponsor Appraiser and Second Parent Appraiser (the
                           "Second Valuations") are within twenty percent (20%)
                           of each other, then the Appraisal Price shall be
                           determined as set forth in paragraph (c) above. If
                           the Second Valuations are not within twenty percent
                           (20%) of each other, then the Second Valuations shall
                           not be used and the Second Parent Appraiser and the
                           Second Sponsor Appraiser, as soon as reasonably
                           practicable, shall jointly select a Firm to act as a
                           final Appraiser (the "Final Appraiser") on reasonable
                           terms agreed to by

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

                           the Sponsor Group and Parent in good faith. So long
                           as the valuation of the Final Appraiser is not higher
                           than the higher of the Second Valuations or lower
                           than the lower of the Second Valuations, the
                           valuation arrived at by the Final Appraiser shall be
                           deemed to be the Appraisal Price. In the event the
                           valuation of the Final Appraiser is greater than the
                           higher of the Second Valuations, then the Appraisal
                           Price shall be the higher of the Second Valuations.
                           In the event the valuation of the Final Appraiser is
                           less than the lower of the Second Valuations, the
                           Appraisal Price shall be the lower of the Second
                           Valuations.

Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

herein, this document embodies the complete agreement and understanding among
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and

counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages) each of which
shall be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and
