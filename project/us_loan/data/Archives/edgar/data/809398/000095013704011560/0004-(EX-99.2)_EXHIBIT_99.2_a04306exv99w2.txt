                 NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

      This Non-competition and Non-solicitation Agreement (this "Agreement") is
dated as of ___________, 2005, by and among Fidelity National Financial, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Fidelity National Information Services,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Any terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of December [__], 2004 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and
among Parent, the Company and the purchasers named therein (the "Purchasers").

                                   WITNESSETH:

            WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the
Purchasers are purchasing from the Company, and the Company is selling to the
Purchasers, common stock of the Company initially representing 25% of its
outstanding capital stock;

            WHEREAS, following consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement, Parent shall own 75% of the Company's outstanding
capital stock, and will receive substantial benefits in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; and

            WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition
precedent to the Purchasers' closing the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein made, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Non-Competition.

      (a) For a period (the "Term") commencing on the date hereof and continuing
until the first anniversary of the date (the "Separation Date") Parent ceases to
beneficially own at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company, Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (other
than the Company or its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, own,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation
or control, other than their ownership and control of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership
form or otherwise, engaged in a Competitive Business (defined below).

      (b) For purposes hereof, "Competitive Business" shall mean:

            (i)   providing (A) retail bank core processing systems, (B)
                  customer channel-solutions (online-retail and commercial, ATM,
                  branch, teller and call center), (C) consumer lending and
                  servicing systems,

<PAGE>

                  (D) commercial lending and servicing systems, including
                  mortgage loan origination and servicing systems, and (E) data
                  center outsourcing services to credit unions, community banks,
                  thrifts, data centers, banks and other financial institutions;
                  and

            (ii)  providing real estate tax, credit, flood, default and
                  appraisal services and multiple listing software and services
                  to financial institutions and loan servicers

      (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent Parent from:

            (i)   Engaging in any of the activities set forth on Schedule 1
                  hereto ("Permitted Competitive Business Activity");

            (ii)  Acquiring control of a business which is engaged in a
                  Competitive Business (an "Acquisition") and continuing to
                  conduct such Competitive Business if, and only if, Parent
                  presents the opportunity to make the Investment to the Board
                  of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and (A) Parent's
                  designees on the Board have voted in favor of the Company or
                  one of its Subsidiaries making such Investment, and (B) the
                  Purchasers' designees on the Board have voted against the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries making such Investment;
                  provided that, Parent has consummated the Investment on the
                  same terms presented to the Board. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, nothing contained in this clause (c)(ii) shall
                  permit Parent to conduct any activities that constitute a
                  Competitive Business through such acquired entity if such type
                  of activities were not conducted by the acquired entity at the
                  time of the Acquisition;

            (iii) Acquiring control of a business (A) which earns less than 10%
                  of its annual revenues from engaging in a Competitive Business
                  ("Minor Competitive Activity"); provided, however that such
                  Minor Competitive Activity shall comprise less than 10% of the
                  annual revenues of the acquired business during the entire
                  Term hereof, or (B) which earns more than 10%, but less than
                  50% of its annual revenues from engaging in a Competitive
                  Business ("Divestible Competitive Activity"); provided,
                  however that such Divestible Competitive Activity shall be
                  offered to the Company within thirty (30) days after closing
                  such acquisition at a price equal to that paid by the Parent
                  or, if such price was not separately determined, at fair
                  market value as determined by mutual consent of the parties or
                  a mutually agreed upon appraisal process; or

                                       2

            (iv)  being a passive owner of less than five percent (5%) of the
                  outstanding stock of a corporation which is publicly traded
                  and is engaged in a Competitive Business.

2. Severability. Each provision herein shall be treated as a separate and
independent clause, and the unenforceability of any one clause shall in no way
impair the enforceability of any other clauses of the Agreement. If one or more
of the provisions contained herein shall for any reason be held to be
excessively broad in scope, activity, subject or otherwise so as to be
unenforceable at law, such provision(s) shall be construed by the appropriate
judicial body by limiting or reducing it (or them) so as to be enforceable to
the maximum extent under the applicable law.

3. Amendments; Waiver. Any amendment to or modification of this Agreement, or
any waiver of any provision hereof, shall be in writing and signed by the
Company and Parent, and shall be approved by the Purchasers. Any waiver by the
Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or any other
provision hereof.

4. Assignment; Successors. The Company shall have the right to assign this
Agreement to its successors and assigns. All covenants and agreements hereunder
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

5. Equitable Relief. Parent agrees that a breach of this Agreement will result
in irreparable harm to the Company and that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and that the Company shall
be entitled, in addition to all other remedies available to it, to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, without the
necessity of posting a bond or other security as a result of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

6. Governing Law; Forum Selection Clause. This Agreement and any claims arising
out of this Agreement (or any other claims arising out of the relationship
between the parties) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be interpreted, enforced
and governed under the internal and domestic laws of such state, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state. Any claims or legal
actions by one party against the other may be commenced and maintained in any
state or federal court located in such state, and the parties hereby submit to
the jurisdiction and venue of any such court.

7. Enforcement. The Purchasers shall have the right to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement on behalf of the Company, including the right to commence legal
proceedings.
