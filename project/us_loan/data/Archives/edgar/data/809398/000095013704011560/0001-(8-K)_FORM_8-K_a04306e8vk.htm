<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>(a)&nbsp;Definitive Material Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Transaction</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;23, 2004, Fidelity National Financial, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (&#147;FNF&#148;), announced the execution of a definitive Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of December&nbsp;23, 2004 (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;), between
Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF (&#147;FNIS&#148;), FNF, certain affiliates of Thomas H.
Lee Partners, L.P. (&#147;THL&#148; or the &#147;THL Entities&#148;) and certain affiliates of
Texas Pacific Group (&#147;TPG&#148; or the &#147;TPG Entities&#148;). The Purchase Agreement
provides the terms upon which FNIS will sell a 25&nbsp;percent minority equity
interest in FNIS common stock to the THL Entities and the TPG Entities
(collectively, the &#147;Sponsors&#148; or the &#147;Sponsor Group&#148;) for a purchase price of
$500,000,000 (the &#147;Transaction&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed by FNF, a condition to the Transaction is the
consummation of a recapitalization of FNIS. FNF is currently in the
negotiation process with a consortium of lenders regarding the credit facility
to be entered into with respect to the recapitalization plan. Upon the
successful completion of the recapitalization of FNIS, FNF will pay a special
$10 per share cash dividend to FNF stockholders which is anticipated to be
declared and paid during the first quarter of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FNF anticipates the closing of the Transaction to occur following the
recapitalization and payment of the special dividend. As detailed more fully
below, upon consummation of the Transaction, a new FNIS board of directors will
be established. William P. Foley, II, current Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of FNF, will serve as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FNIS.
Following the closing of the Transaction, FNF will have the right to appoint
twelve of the members of the FNIS board of directors and THL and TPG will each
have the right to appoint two members of the FNIS board. THL and TPG have
certain demand registration rights, including rights relating to the
registration of their shares in a public offering of FNIS common stock if
certain criteria are met relating to the potential price and gross proceeds
that would be generated by the public offering. If FNIS has not consummated a
public offering of its common stock within two years of the closing of the
Transaction, the Sponsors have various rights relating to a sale of their
shares of FNIS common stock which are summarized below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement requires the establishment of an option pool for
members of FNIS management to purchase an aggregate 7.5&nbsp;percent of the
fully-diluted shares of FNIS at the same price paid by the Sponsor Group for
their minority equity interest in FNIS. A portion of the option pool will be
subject to time-based, quarterly vesting over four and five-year periods, while
the other portion will be subject to performance-based vesting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Purchase Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides for certain representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnities in connection with the Transaction. The closing of
the Transaction under the Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing
conditions, including conditions related to approvals, expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
consents and waivers, and the closing of the FNIS bank facility on terms
provided for under the Purchase Agreement. In addition to these closing
conditions, the Purchase Agreement also

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">requires the parties to execute other transaction documents relating to
the Transaction, including the following:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stockholders Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Transaction, FNIS will enter into a Stockholders
Agreement with the Sponsor Group. Under the Stockholders Agreement, following
the closing of the Transaction the parties agree to vote their FNIS shares such
that FNF will have the right to elect up to twelve directors and THL and TPG
will have the right to elect two directors each. In the event that THL or TPG
cease to own at least 50% of the shares held by either of them as of the
closing of the Transaction, they will be entitled to elect only one director.
The Sponsor Group will also have the right to representation on each of the
committees of the FNIS board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the chairman of the FNIS
board shall be elected by a majority vote of the FNIS board; provided that
William P. Foley, II shall serve as a Chairman for an initial period of three
years. The Stockholders Agreement also provides that if the FNIS board
proposes to appoint a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Operating Officer, the Sponsor Group will have a qualified right to veto
the selection of up to three proposed candidates for each position.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stockholders Agreement provides that prior to a public offering of
equity securities of FNIS or any of its subsidiaries, the following actions by
FNIS or any of its subsidiaries will require the approval of the majority of
shares held respectively by THL and by TPG:

</TABLE>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to certain limitations, the Stockholders Agreement provides that
prior to the completion of an initial public offering of equity securities of
FNIS neither FNF nor the Sponsor Group may transfer any of their FNIS common
stock without offering the other parties the right to participate in the sale
on the same terms and conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stockholders Agreement provides the Sponsors with certain liquidity
rights. If FNIS has not consummated a Qualified Public Offering prior to the
second anniversary of the closing of the Transaction, then Sponsors holding at
least 75% of the FNIS shares held by the Sponsors will have the right to notify
FNF of their intent to sell their FNIS shares to FNF, whereupon the parties
will negotiate in good faith the terms of a sale of such shares to FNF or FNIS.
If the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of a sale, the Sponsors may
initiate an appraisal process to determine an appraisal price. If, following
any appraisal process, the Sponsors approve the appraisal price, the Sponsors
may notify FNF and FNIS of their approval, and FNF or FNIS may elect to
purchase for cash such shares at the appraisal price. If the Sponsors approve
the appraisal price, but FNF and FNIS do not elect to purchase or fail to make
an election to purchase the shares, the Sponsors will have the right to compel
a sale of FNIS. If, however, a sale of FNIS does not occur in accordance with
the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, the Sponsors may exchange all
(but not less than all) of their FNIS common stock for the common stock of FNF.
Such exchange would be based upon the appraisal price of the Sponsors&#146; shares
(based on a new appraisal process initiated at the time of exercise of the
exchange) and the fair market value of FNF&#146;s stock, determined by the average
closing price of FNF&#146;s stock for the 45-day trading period immediately prior to
the exchange date. To the extent the number of shares to be received by the
Sponsors at the appraisal price constitutes more than 19.9% of the outstanding
capital stock of FNF (as determined pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange), then the Sponsors will receive the balance in cash as a pro rata
portion of the appraisal price. If following any appraisal process the
Sponsors do not approve the appraisal price, the Sponsors have the right to
initiate the appraisal process two additional times, provided there is a
12-month period between the first election and the second election, and the
second election and the third election.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of the Stockholders Agreement, &#147;Qualified Public
Offering&#148; means a public offering whereby the offered shares trade on a
national securities exchange or NASDAQ, and in which, at the election of FNIS,
either one of the following criteria is fulfilled: (A) (i)&nbsp;the price per share
paid by the public in such offering is at least $15.00 and less than $17.50 and
(ii)&nbsp;the gross proceeds to FNIS would at least equal an amount obtained by
multiplying the per share price in (A)(i) above by that number of shares equal
to 15% of the outstanding shares of FNIS after giving effect to the offering,
or (B) (i)&nbsp;the price per share paid by the public in such offering is at least
$17.50, and (ii)&nbsp;the gross proceeds to FNIS would at least equal an amount
obtained by multiplying the per share price in (B)(i) above by that number of
shares equal to 12.5% of the outstanding shares of FNIS after giving effect to
the offering.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stockholders Agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the
agreement of the parties to terminate the agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the dissolution or
liquidation of FNIS, (iii)&nbsp;the sale of FNIS and (iv)&nbsp;the completion of a public
offering of equity securities of FNIS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Registration Rights Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the closing of the Transaction, FNIS has agreed to
enter into a Registration Rights Agreement with FNF and the Sponsors (the
&#147;Registration Rights Agreement&#148;). The Registration Rights Agreement grants
certain demand registration rights in connection with a Qualified Public
Offering to FNF and to Sponsors holding 75% of the

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">registrable shares owned by the Sponsor Group. The Registration Rights
Agreement also grants certain incidental registration rights to FNF and the
Sponsors. Rights granted under the Registration Rights Agreement are subject
to holdback and other customary restrictions and limitations which are
described in the agreement.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Indemnification Agreements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the closing of the Transaction, FNIS will enter into
Director Indemnification Agreements (collectively, the &#147;Indemnification
Agreements&#148;) with members of the board of directors of FNIS (the
&#147;Indemnitees&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification Agreements, FNIS
will provide the Indemnitees with specific contractual rights to
indemnification against litigation expenses and liabilities, and to the extent
insurance is available, coverage under a director&#146;s liability insurance policy
of FNIS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Noncompetition Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, FNF has agreed to enter into a
Non-competition and Non-solicitation Agreement with FNIS (the &#147;Noncompetition
Agreement&#148;) as a condition to the closing of the Transaction. Under the terms
of the Noncompetition Agreement, for a period from the date of the agreement
until the first anniversary of the date that FNF ceases to beneficially own at
least a majority of the outstanding capital stock of FNIS, FNF agrees that it
will not, and will cause its affiliates (other than FNIS or its subsidiaries)
not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or control of, other than ownership and
control of FNIS and its subsidiaries, any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in specified
businesses that are competitive with the business of FNIS (a &#147;Competitive
Business&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the
Noncompetition Agreement prevents FNF from: (i)&nbsp;engaging in certain enumerated
activities; (ii)&nbsp;acquiring control of a business which is engaged in a
Competitive Business and continuing to conduct such Competitive Business if FNF
presents the opportunity to make the acquisition to the FNIS board of directors
and (A)&nbsp;FNF&#146;s designees on the FNIS board have voted in favor of FNIS or one of
its subsidiaries making such acquisition and (B)&nbsp;the Sponsors&#146; designees on the
FNIS board have voted against FNIS or any of its subsidiaries making such
investment, provided that, FNF has consummated the acquisition on the same

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management Agreements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the closing of the Transaction, FNIS has agreed to
enter into a Management Agreement with THL Managers V, LLC, an affiliate of
THL, and a Management Agreement with TPG GenPar IV, L.P., an affiliate of TPG
(collectively, the &#147;Management Agreements&#148;). Under the terms of the Management
Agreements, certain affiliates of the Sponsors will provide FNIS with advice
and analysis, including advice with respect to debt facilities and arrangements
and other matters (collectively, &#147;Advisory Services&#148;). Each Management
Agreement provides that FNIS will pay the applicable THL or TPG affiliate in
exchange for the Advisory Services: (i)&nbsp;a one time transaction fee of
$12,500,000, payable at the closing of the Transaction, and (ii)&nbsp;an annual
management fee, payable in advance in semi-annual installments beginning at the
closing of the Transaction in an amount per year equal to $1,250,000. Each of
the Management Agreements will terminate on the earlier to occur of five years
after the closing of the Transaction and the consummation of a public offering
of the equity securities of FNIS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>2005 Stock Incentive Plan</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides for FNIS&#146;s adoption of a stock incentive
plan, referred to as the Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. 2005
Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), under which incentive awards consisting of
shares of FNIS common stock or options to purchase shares of FNIS common stock
may be granted to employees, directors and consultants of FNIS and its
subsidiaries. The Plan will become effective upon adoption by the FNIS board,
subject to approval of the majority of FNIS&#146;s Stockholders within twelve months
of its adoption, and will terminate automatically on the day before the tenth
anniversary of its adoption, unless earlier terminated by the FNIS board.
Stock options granted under the Plan may consist of options intended to qualify
as incentive stock options (as that term is defined in Section&nbsp;422 of the
Internal Revenue Code) or options not intended to so qualify. Stock awards may
be granted with or without a purchase price, and may contain vesting and other
terms and conditions, as the Plan&#146;s administrator may determine. The Plan will
be administered by the FNIS board or, at its election, by one or more
committees consisting of one or more members who have been appointed by the
FNIS board. The maximum number of shares of FNIS common stock that may be
issued pursuant to awards under the Plan will be 7.5% of FNIS&#146;s outstanding
common stock, on a fully diluted basis immediately after the closing of the
Transaction, subject to adjustment in connection with certain events or series
of events affecting FNIS&#146;s capital structure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the foregoing share limit and other terms and conditions in the
Plan, the Plan&#146;s administrator is authorized to grant awards under the Plan
from time to time during the term of the Plan and to determine the terms of
such awards; however, it is anticipated that awards respecting most or all of
the shares reserved for issuance under the Plan will be granted at or around
the time of the closing of the Transaction. The exercise price of awards will
be equal to the price per share paid by the Sponsor Group in the Transaction.
Awards will be evidenced by award agreements, which will set forth terms and
conditions of the awards to the extent not set forth in the Plan. Unless a
recipient&#146;s award agreement provides otherwise, the vested portion of a
recipient&#146;s stock options will expire on the earlier of: (i)&nbsp;the expiration of
their term, which will in no event be greater than ten years, (ii)&nbsp;twelve
months following termination of the recipient&#146;s service as a result of death,
disability, retirement, or termination for other than cause, or (iii)&nbsp;the date
of termination of the recipient&#146;s service if the termination is for cause or
voluntary by the recipient. Any unvested portion of a recipient&#146;s options will
expire upon termination of service.

(i)&nbsp;identify all of the services that have been historically provided by FNF to
FNIS or its subsidiaries and all other relationships between FNIS or its
subsidiaries and FNF that are necessary for FNIS and its subsidiaries to
continue operating in a manner that is substantially equivalent to the manner
in which they have operated during the twelve months prior to the date of the
Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Relationships&#148;); (ii)&nbsp;identify all of the other

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The securities to be sold under the Purchase Agreement will be offered and
sold in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), and Rule

investors are acquiring the securities for their own account and not with a
view to the distribution thereof in the absence of an effective registration
statement or an applicable exemption from registration, and that the investors
are accredited investors (as defined by Rule&nbsp;501 under the Securities Act). At
the time of their issuance, the securities will be deemed to be restricted
securities for purposes of the Securities Act, as amended, and the certificates
representing the securities shall bear legends to that effect. Please see
