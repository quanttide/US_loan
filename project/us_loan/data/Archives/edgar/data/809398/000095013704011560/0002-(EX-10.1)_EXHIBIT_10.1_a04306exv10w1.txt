therein, subject in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements to lack of
footnotes and a statement of changes in equity and comprehensive earnings and
normal year end adjustments that will not be material. Since June 30, 2004,
there has not been any change of the Company's accounting principles, methods,
or policies except as required by GAAP or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a

                                       15
<PAGE>

Material Adverse Effect. The results and accounts of the entities listed on
disclosure Schedule 3.10 are included in the Financial Statements, but have been
excluded from the final formation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and are
therefore, not subject to the terms of this Transaction.

      3.11 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities, Indebtedness. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no Liabilities that are required to be reflected in, reserved
against, or otherwise described in a balance sheet (or the notes thereto)
prepared in accordance with GAAP except (i) those Liabilities provided for or
reserved against in the Financial Statements (or set forth in the notes
thereto), (ii) Liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since June 30, 2004, and (iii) Liabilities under this
Agreement. Immediately after the Closing, other than the Indebtedness for
borrowed money incurred in connection with the Financing and other than with
respect to Capital Leases, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
have any Indebtedness.

      3.12 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth in the Unaudited
Financial Statements and except as contemplated by the Financing, since June 30,
2004, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has: (i) terminated or
suffered any material amendment of any Material Contract; (ii) suffered any
event or circumstance that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, increased the salaries or other compensation of,
or made any advance or loan to, any of its current or former directors or
executive officers or made any increase in, or any addition to, other benefits
to which any of its current or former directors or executive officers may be
entitled; (iv) declared, set aside, or paid any dividend or made or agreed to
make any other distribution or payment in respect of its Capital Stock or
redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired or agreed to redeem, purchase, or
acquire any of its Capital Stock or other securities; (v) waived any right of
material value to the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (vi) incurred any
Indebtedness.

      3.13 Litigation; Orders. There is no claim or judicial or administrative
action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to Parent's Knowledge,
threatened (i) that questions the validity of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, the performance by the Company or Parent of the
obligations to be performed by it hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (ii) except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, relating to the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as now conducted or as
proposed to be conducted) or materially affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties. There is no
material Order of any Governmental Entity binding on the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets or properties.

      3.14 Compliance with Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
complied in all material respects with each Law and Order binding on it or on
any of its assets or properties and is not currently in material violation of
any such Law or Order,

                                       16
<PAGE>

and there have been no notices or Orders of noncompliance issued to the Company
of any of its Subsidiaries under or in respect of any such Law.

      3.15 Permits. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns, holds,
possesses, or lawfully uses in its business all approvals, authorizations,
certifications, franchises, licenses, permits, and equivalent authorities
("Permits") that are necessary for the conduct of their business as currently
conducted or the ownership and use of their assets or properties, in compliance
with all Laws, except for those Permits the failure to obtain or loss of which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in Default under, or has received any
notice of any claim of Default in respect of, any such Permits, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To Parent's
Knowledge, all such Permits are renewable by their respective terms in the
ordinary course of business without the need to comply with any special
qualification procedures or to pay any amounts other than routine filing fees.

      3.16 Contracts. Schedule 3.16 sets forth all of the following Contracts to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound:
(i) Contracts with any labor union or association representing any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) Contracts for the sale of any of
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary

Subsidiaries acquired the capital stock or assets of another entity and which
contain earn-out provisions relating to such acquisition requiring the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to make payments in the future in excess of $250,000
individually or $750,000 in the aggregate. All of the Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound are in
full force and effect and are the legal, valid, and binding obligations of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries, enforceable against them in accordance with
their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and equivalent Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, in any
respect under any Contract of the Company and its Subsidiaries, nor, to Parent's
Knowledge, is any other party to any such Contract in default thereunder in any
respect.

      3.17 Intellectual Property.

      (a) Schedule 3.17(a) sets forth an accurate and complete list of all
material Patents, registered Marks, pending applications for registrations of
any Marks, registered

                                       17
<PAGE>

Copyrights, and pending applications for registration of Copyrights, owned or
filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

      (b) The Company or its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive owner of all
right, title and interest in and to all of the Patents, the registered Marks,

works of authorship prepared by or for the Company or its Subsidiary that
resulted from or arose out of any work performed by or on behalf of the Company

the Company or its Subsidiaries in their businesses as presently conducted, free
and clear of all Encumbrances.

      (c) To Parent's Knowledge, and except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Intellectual Property owned, used,
practiced or otherwise commercially exploited by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with, their businesses as presently conducted (the "Company
Intellectual Property") do not constitute an unauthorized use or
misappropriation of any Patent, Copyright, trade secret or other equivalent
right, of any Person and do not infringe, constitute an unauthorized use of, or
violate any other right of any Person. The Intellectual Property owned by or
licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or as to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries otherwise possess valid and continuing rights for use, includes all
of the material intellectual property rights necessary to enable the Company and
its Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses in the manner in which such
businesses are currently being conducted.

      (d) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) is a party to
any suit, action or proceeding which involves a claim of infringement or

and except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, the manufacturing, marketing, licensing, use or sale of the products or
the performance of the services offered by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the ordinary course of its respective businesses as presently conducted do not
currently infringe, and have not infringed, upon any Patent, Copyright or trade
secret right of any third party.

                                       18
<PAGE>

      (e) No trade secret or any other non-public, proprietary information
material to the Business as presently conducted has been authorized to be
disclosed or, to Parent's Knowledge, has been actually disclosed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any employee or any third party other than
pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement or employment policy restricting the
disclosure and use of such trade secret or non-public proprietary information.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken adequate security measures to
protect the secrecy and confidentiality of all trade secrets and any other
material confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries which
measures are reasonable in the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate.

any current or prior officers, employees, or Contractors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries claiming any ownership interest in any Company Intellectual
Property as a result of having been involved in the development of such property
while employed by or performing services for the Company or its Subsidiaries.

      (g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, the Company's unmodified version of its material software that is
marketed and licensed by the Company and its Subsidiaries to its customers (the
"Products") conforms in all material respects with the documentation prepared,
marketed and licensed by the Company in respect of such Products. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) there
are no defects, malfunctions or nonconformities in the unmodified version of the
Products that cause the unmodified version of the Products, as properly
installed, not to perform the material functions for which they are intended, on
the whole, as provided in the Company's documentation, and (ii) there are no
errors in any documentation, specifications, manuals, and user guides associated
with or used or produced in the development, maintenance or marketing of the
Company Intellectual Property.

      3.18 Affiliate Transactions. Except as contemplated by the Intercompany
Agreements, and except for arrangements between the Parent or its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on the one hand, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries on the other hand, which do not involve payments by any
party of more than $500,000 annually in the aggregate and which do not restrict
the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to engage in any line of
business in any geographic area, no stockholder, officer, or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to Parent's Knowledge, any member of his

has a business relationship with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or
that competes with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) owns,
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any real property, leasehold
interests, or other property or any Permits, the use of which is necessary for
the conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted. To the Company's Knowledge, no
Related Person has any direct or indirect (other than through stock ownership in
a public company) interest in any Contract to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound.

      3.19 Assets and Properties. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
good and marketable title to its assets and properties, and a valid leasehold
interest in leasehold estates, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than

course of business consistent with past practice and that do not materially
impair the ownership or use of such assets or properties. Such assets and

uses for which they are used in the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, are not subject to any condition which materially interferes with
the use thereof by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and,
together with rights under the Intercompany Agreements, constitute all assets,
properties, interests in properties and rights necessary to permit the Company
and its Subsidiaries to carry on their business after the Closing substantially
as conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior thereto.

      3.20 Insurance. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in full force
and effect all insurance policies, with coverage, in customary amounts (subject
to reasonable deductibles), sufficient to provide adequate insurance coverage
for all of the assets and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
material risks in compliance with all applicable Laws, Orders, and Permits.
There are no pending claims against any such insurance policy as to which the
insurers have denied liability.

properly allocable to the Company and its Subsidiaries (as opposed to those

Subsidiaries (such contested matters and the exposure thereunder as of the date
of this Agreement are set forth on Schedule 3.21(a) and such contested matters

      3.22 Employee Benefit Plans.

      (a) Schedule 3.22(a) sets forth a true and complete list of all "employee
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and any employee benefit plans,
agreements, arrangements, programs or payroll practices (including, without
limitation, severance

                                       22
<PAGE>

pay, vacation pay, company awards, salary continuation for disability, sick
leave, retirement, deferred compensation, equity-based, bonus or other incentive
compensation, stock purchase arrangements or policies, hospitalization, medical
insurance, life insurance, and scholarship programs) maintained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
contributes or is obligated to contribute thereunder in respect of any current
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could otherwise have any liability
(contingent or otherwise), including any liability that results from the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries being considered a single employer or under common
control with any entity (whether incorporated or not) under Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") (in each case, any of the
foregoing, whether domestic or foreign "Employee Benefit Plans"). The Company
disclosure letter identifies, in separate categories, Employee Benefit Plans
that are (i) subject to Sections 4063 and 4064 of ERISA ("Multiple Employer
Plans"), (ii) multiemployer plans (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
("Multiemployer Plans"), or (iii) "benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code providing continuing benefits after the termination of
employment (other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title
I of ERISA or comparable state or local Laws and at the former employee's or his
or her beneficiary's sole expense).

      (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, each of the Employee Benefit Plans intended to qualify under
Section 401 of the Code ("Qualified Plans") so qualify and the trusts maintained
thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code,
and, to Parent's Knowledge, nothing has occurred in respect of the operation of
any such plan that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or
the imposition of any liability, penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code.

      (c) All contributions and premiums required by Law or by the terms of any
Employee Benefit Plan have been timely made (without regard to any waivers
granted in respect thereof) to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith, and no accumulated funding deficiencies exist in any of
such plans subject to Section 412 of the Code.

      (d) The benefit liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA),
of each of the Employee Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA using the
actuarial assumptions that would be used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") in the event it terminated each such plan do not exceed
the fair market value of the assets of each such plan. The liabilities of each
Employee Benefit Plan that has been terminated or otherwise wound up, have been
fully discharged in full compliance with applicable Law.

      (e) During the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, no "reportable
event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended has
occurred with

                                       23
<PAGE>

respect to any of the Employee Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, nor
has any event requiring notice to be provided under Section 4041(c)(3)(C) or
4063(a) of ERISA.

      (f) There has been no violation of ERISA in respect of the filing of
applicable returns, reports, documents, and notices regarding any of the
Employee Benefit Plans with the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of the
Treasury or the furnishing of such notices or documents to the participants or
beneficiaries of the Employee Benefit Plans or Pension Plans that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      (g) True and complete copies of the following documents, in respect of
each of the Employee Benefit Plans that, after the Closing, the Company or any
if its Subsidiaries will maintain, contribute to, or have any liability with
respect to (as applicable), have been delivered to Purchaser (i) any plans and
related trust documents, and all amendments thereto, (ii) the most recent Forms
5500 for the past three years and schedules thereto, (iii) the most recent
financial statements and actuarial valuations for the past three years, (iv) the
most recent IRS determination letter, (v) the most recent summary plan
descriptions (including letters or other documents updating such descriptions),
and (vi) written descriptions of all material non-written agreements relating to
such Employee Benefit Plans.

      (h) There is no pending claim, action, suit, or proceeding that has been
asserted or instituted against any Employee Benefit Plan , the assets of any
such plans, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or the plan administrator or
any fiduciary of the Employee Benefit Plans in respect of the operation of such
plans (other than routine, uncontested benefit claims) and no Employee Benefit
Plan is under audit or is the subject of any audit or investigation by any
Governmental Entity, and there are no facts or circumstances that could form the
basis for any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or audit, in each case,
except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

      (i) Each of the Employee Benefit Plans has been maintained, in all
material respects, in accordance with its terms and all provisions of applicable
Law. All amendments and actions required to bring each of the Employee Benefit
Plans into conformity in all material respects with all of the applicable
provisions of ERISA and other applicable Laws have been made or taken except to
the extent that such amendments or actions are not required by Law to be made or
taken until a date after the Closing Date. Except to the extent it would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur,
either directly or indirectly (including as a result of an indemnification
obligation), any liability under Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty, excise
tax or joint and several liability provisions of the Code or any foreign law or
regulation relating to employee benefit plans (including, without limitation,
Section 406, 409, 502(i), 502(1), 4069 or 42 12(c) of ERISA, or Section 4971,
4975 or 4976 of the Code), or under any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or
legal requirement pursuant to or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan has agreed to
indemnify or is required to indemnify any person against

                                       24
<PAGE>

liability incurred under, or for a violation or failure to satisfy the
requirements of any such legal requirement, and to the knowledge of the Company,
no event, transaction or condition has occurred, exists or is expected to occur
which could result in any such liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing.

      (j) The Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and any ERISA Affiliate that
maintains a "benefits plan" (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of ERISA)
have complied with the notice and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and the applicable regulations
thereunder, except to the extent that failure to so comply would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      (k) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any ERISA Affiliate or
any organization to which any is a successor or parent corporation, has divested
any business or entity maintaining or sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan
having unfunded benefit liabilities (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(18)
of ERISA) or transferred any such plan to any Person other than the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate during the five-year period ending
on the Closing Date.

      (l) To Parent's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" in respect of the Employee
Benefit Plans has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      (m) None of the Company, any Subsidiary, or any ERISA Affiliate has
terminated any Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or incurred
any outstanding liability under Section 4062 of ERISA to the PBGC or to a
trustee appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA and no Person (including without
limitation the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) has instituted any
proceeding to terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan or appoint a
trustee to administer any such Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan, in each
case, except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

      (n) Other than the granting of stock options pursuant to the Stock
Incentive Plan, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment becoming due to any employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan or
Pension Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any such benefits.

      (o) No stock or other security issued by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries forms or has formed a material part of the assets of any Employee
Benefit Plan.

      (p) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any

amount after the

                                       25
<PAGE>

Closing Date by the Company or any Subsidiary that would not be deductible by
the party making such payment by reason of Section 280G of the Code, or would
constitute compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 162(m)
of the Code.

      (q) Except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Plan, to the extent requiring
qualification under any applicable governmental laws or authority, is so
qualified. According to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used for the purposes of funding each Foreign Plan (or, if the same has no such
assumptions and valuations or is unfunded, according to actuarial assumptions
and valuations in use by the PBGC on the date hereof), as of October 12, 2004
the total amount or value of the funds available under each such Foreign Plan to
pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such benefits,
together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeded the present
value of all benefits (contingent or otherwise) accrued as of such date of all
participants and past participants therein in respect of which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has or would have after the Closing Date any obligation.

      Each of the Purchasers, severally as to itself only, and not jointly,
hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Company, each
of which is true and correct as of the date hereof:

      4.1 Organization. Such Purchaser is a limited partnership, corporation or
a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing, and in good standing
under the Laws of the state of its incorporation or formation, as the case may
be.

      4.2 Authorization. Such Purchaser has the requisite partnership, corporate
or limited liability company power, as the case may be, to execute and deliver
this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to be executed by it in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the

The execution and delivery by such Purchaser of this Agreement and each
Purchaser Document and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder have been (or at the time of execution will be) duly authorized by
all necessary partnership, corporate or limited liability company action, as the
case may be, on the part of such Purchaser. This Agreement has been (and each
Purchaser Document will be) duly executed and delivered by such Purchaser and,
assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Purchaser
Document by the other party or parties hereto or thereto, constitutes or will
constitute a

<PAGE>

valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser enforceable against such
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other equivalent Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights in general and subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity).

      4.3 Consents and Approvals. Except as would not have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, no consent, approval, waiver, order, or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, or filing with, or notice to, any Person or
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or in respect of, such
Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
Purchaser Document by such Purchaser, the performance by such Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, other than the filing of premerger notification
and report forms under the HSR Act and any required filings with insurance
authorities in New York State.

      4.4 No Conflicts. Except as would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not (and each
Purchaser Document will not), and neither the performance by such Purchaser of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will (i) conflict with the
organizational and partnership documents of such Purchaser or (ii) violate any
Order of any Governmental Entity or Law applicable to such Purchaser.

      4.5 Brokers' Fees. Neither such Purchaser nor any Person acting on its

Transaction in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof.

      4.6 Securities Law Matters; Valid Offering. Such Purchaser is acquiring
the Shares for investment for its own account, and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Such Purchaser (either alone
or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic
risks of such investment. Such Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined
in Rule 501(a) of Registration D under the Securities Act. Such Purchaser
understands and acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act, or the securities Laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction and,
unless so registered, may not be offered, sold, transferred, or otherwise
disposed of except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable securities Laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction. THL further
represents and warrants to the Parent as to the matters set forth on Schedule
4.6(a). TPG further represents and warrants to the Parent as to the matters set

      (a) Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Purchasers, the
Company and their Affiliates (provided however that the Parent shall not be
obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates

      Tax, to the extent the amount of such Tax has been (1) paid, (2) accrued
      on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
      dated November 30, 2004 previously delivered to Purchasers by Parent, (3)
      accrued in the financial statements delivered to Purchasers pursuant to
      Section 5.11 (the "Accruals") (provided that such Accruals are made

      allocable to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall
      (i) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income or gross
      receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
      relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of
      any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or gross
      receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
      multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in
      the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
      of which is the number of days in the entire period. Any allocation of
      income or deductions required to determine any Taxes relating to a such
      period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
      ended on the Closing Date and by means of a closing of the books and
      records of the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, as of the close
      of the Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions
      that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,
      depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
      period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
      proportion to the number of days in each such period.

            (iv) Title IV of ERISA solely as a result of the Company being or
having been an ERISA Affiliate of Parent.

      The Purchasers shall determine, in their sole discretion, as to whether
the Company, the Purchasers, or any other party entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 8.2(a) shall be the recipient of indemnification
payments made hereunder.

      (b) Purchasers shall severally, but not jointly, indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless the Company, the Parent and their Affiliates from and against any
and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent relating to, resulting from, or
arising out of:

            (i) any breach of representation or warranty of such Purchaser under
this Agreement; and

                                       45
<PAGE>

            (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of
such Purchaser under this Agreement.

      (c) For purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation and
warranty has occurred and for purposes of determining the amount of any
Indemnifiable Loss for all purposes under this Article VIII, each representation
and warranty contained in this Agreement (other than the representation in
Section 3.12(ii)) shall be read without regard to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifier contained therein.

      8.3 Deductible; Maximum Liability. Neither Parent nor the Purchasers shall
be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless their respective Indemnitees under
Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Indemnifiable Losses by the Indemnitees under such Section 8.2(a)(i) or
Section 8.2(b)(i), as the case may be, exceeds $30.0 million for all
Indemnifiable Losses (the "Deductible"), at which point Parent or the
Purchasers, as the case may be, shall be liable to their respective Indemnitees
for the value of the Indemnitee's claims under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section
8.2(b)(i), as the case may be, that is in excess of the Deductible, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VIII . The maximum aggregate liability
of each of Parent and the Purchasers (considered together in the case of the
Purchasers), as the case may be, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all
Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article VIII shall be $250.0 million (the
"Cap"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the
Deductible nor the Cap shall apply with respect to Indemnifiable Losses to the
extent relating to, resulting from, or arising out of (x) any breach or
nonfulfillment of any agreement or any covenant contained in this Agreement, (y)
any breach of representation or warranty contained in any of Sections 3.2, 3.5,
3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.21, the third sentence of 3.22(i), 4.2, 4.5 and 4.6, or any
Indemnifiable Loss under Section 8.2(a)(iii); provided, however, that Parent
shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnitee hereunder
for a breach of Section 3.21 or for any Indemnifiable Loss relating to,
resulting from, or arising out of clause (A) of Section 8.2(a)(iii), unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such Indemnifiable Losses under such Section
3.21 and Section 8.2(a)(iii) exceeds $250,000 and then only to the extent of the
Purchase Price, or (z) any Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or
arising out of ERISA matters set forth in Section 8.1(a)(iv).

      8.4 Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

      (i) "Indemnitee" means any person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

      (ii) "Indemnitor" means any person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement;

      (iii) "Indemnifiable Losses" means any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs, and expenses, and any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits, proceedings, or investigations or appeals by any Person,
including the costs and expenses of any and all assessments, judgments,
settlements, and compromises relating thereto but

                                       46
<PAGE>

not including attorneys' fees and expenses in respect thereof and in respect of
establishing the right to indemnification hereunder; provided, however that any
Indemnity Payment (x) made to the Purchasers shall be prorated to reflect only
the Purchasers then percentage ownership interest in the Company, and, shall in
no event include any special or punitive damages (unless in connection with a
Third Party Claim), and (y) shall be net of any (A) amounts actually recovered
(after deducting related costs and expenses) or recoverable by the Indemnitee
for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is made under any
insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any Person other than a party
hereto, and (B) Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnitee in respect of
any Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is made.

      (iv) "Indemnity Payment" means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required
to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

      (v) "Third-Party Claim" means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made
or brought by any person that is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate
of a party to this Agreement.

      8.5 Procedures for Third-Party Claims.

      (a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third-Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor may
be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee
shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in no event
later than 30 days after becoming aware) thereof; provided, however, that no
delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve
the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the
extent) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such delay.

      (b) Any Indemnitor will have the right to defend the Indemnitee against
the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee so long as (i) the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitee has given notice of the Third-Party
Claim that the Indemnitor will indemnify the Indemnitee from and against any
such Indemnifiable Losses, (ii) the Indemnitor provides the Indemnitee with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor will have
the financial resources to defend against the Third-Party Claim and, (iii) the
Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and
diligently; provided, that, in the event settlement of, or an adverse judgment
in respect of, a Third-Party Claim, is likely, in the good faith judgment of a
Purchaser who is an Indemnitee hereunder, to adversely affect the reputation or
business of such Purchaser or its Affiliates, such Purchaser shall have the
right to defend, at its expense, against such Third-Party Claim with the counsel
of its choice. The Purchasers may also participate in defense of any other
Third-Party Claim at their expense.

      (c) So long as the Indemnitor is conducting the defense of the Third-Party
Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b), (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate
co-

                                       47
<PAGE>

counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement in respect of the
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which
consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or withheld), and (iii)
the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement in respect of the Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent will not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed, or withheld); provided, however, that, in respect of
clause (iii) above, the Indemnitee may condition such consent upon the delivery
by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a duly executed unconditional
release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third-Party
Claim.

      (d) In the event any condition set forth in Section 8.4(b) is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnitee may defend against, and consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement in respect of, the
Third-Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate, provided
that the Indemnitee will consult with and obtain the consent of the Indemnitor
in connection therewith which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or
withheld, (ii) the Indemnitor will reimburse the Indemnitee promptly and
periodically for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnitor will remain
responsible for any Indemnifiable Losses the Indemnitee may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by, the
Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 8.4.

      8.6 Direct Claims. The Indemnitor will have a period of thirty (30) days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account of
an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim"). If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the
Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the
Indemnitee will be entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnitee. In any case where the Purchasers are the Indemnitees, the Purchasers
may bring the claim on behalf of the Purchasers or the Company, in their sole
discretion.

      8.7 Sole Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, if the
Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing with
respect to any and all claims arising out of or related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in
this Article VIII; provided, however that nothing contained herein shall prevent
an Indemnitee from bringing a claim based on fraud.

      8.8 Certain Other Matters. Upon making any Indemnity Payment, Indemnitor
will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all rights of
Indemnitee against any third person (other than an insurance company) in respect
of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity Payment related; provided,
however, that (i) Indemnitor shall then be in compliance with its obligations
under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and (ii) until
Indemnitee fully recovers its

                                       48
<PAGE>

Indemnifiable payment, any and all claims of the Indemnitor against any such
third person on account of such Indemnity Payment will be subrogated and
subordinated in right of payment to Indemnitee's rights against such third
person. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof,
each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described
subrogation and subordination rights. Any Indemnity Payment hereunder shall be
treated as an adjustment to the applicable purchase price.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   Termination

      Company, on the other hand;

            (b) by Purchasers or the Company if there shall have been entered a
      final, non-appealable order or injunction by any Governmental Entity
      prohibiting or restraining the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated hereby or any material part hereof;

            (c) by the non-breaching party if another party shall have breached
      or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
      warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement,
      which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
      condition to the terminating party's obligations as set forth in Article
      VI, and (B) such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being or has
      not been cured by the breaching party within 20 calendar days after giving
      written notice to the breaching party of such breach or failure to
      perform; provided, however that with respect to any breach of the No MAE
      Reps, the Parent shall have the right for 10 business days following the
      receipt of notice from the Purchasers Representatives of their intent to
      terminate this Agreement pursuant to this section, to attempt to cure such
      breach prior to the Purchasers being deemed to have any right to terminate
      this Agreement pursuant to this section;

            (d) by Parent and the Company if any Restraint having any of the
      effects set forth in Section 5.5 shall be in effect and shall have become
      final and nonappealable (provided that the right to terminate this
      Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to any party
      who has materially breached any representation, warranty or failed to
      fulfill any obligation under this Agreement)

            (e) by the Purchasers if the Parent Board Approval is not obtained
      by January 7, 2005; and

                                       49
<PAGE>

            (f) by Purchasers or Parent on or after May 31, 2005, if the Closing
      has not occurred prior to such date; provided that the right to terminate
      this Agreement under this Section 9.1(f) shall not be available to any
      party who has materially breached any representation, warranty or failed
      to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement ;and provided further that
      if the only condition yet to be satisfied as of May 31, 2005 is the
      approval of the New York State Insurance Department, this date shall be
      automatically extended until July 31, 2005.

      The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b),
9.1(c), or 9.1(d) shall promptly give written notice of such termination to the
other party.

      9.2 Effect of Termination. Except for Section 5.6, 5.9 and this Section
9.2 and Article X which shall survive any termination of this Agreement, upon
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
become null and void and of no further force and effect and all obligations of
the parties hereto shall terminate and there shall be no liability or obligation
of any party hereto; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any
party hereto from liability for its default under or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement under this Agreement prior to
such termination (other than a failure to obtain the Parent Board Approval;
provided a Board meeting of Parent has been held in accordance with Section
5.12).

party, assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations
hereunder to any Affiliate of such Purchaser so long as such Affiliate joins as
a Purchaser party hereto. Any attempted assignment, delegation, or transfer in
violation of this Section 10.2 shall be void and of no force or effect.

           Facsimile: (212) 225-3999

      Notice shall be deemed given, received, and effective on: (i) if given by

may assert any claim or cause of action against any officer, director,
stockholder, controlling person, manager, member, partner, employer, agent,
representative, or Affiliate of any other party nor their respective officers,
directors, stockholders, controlling persons, managers, members, partners,
employees, agents, or representatives in connection with, arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

      10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held (by a court of
competent jurisdiction) to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under the
applicable Law of any jurisdiction, (i) the remainder of this Agreement or the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances or in other
jurisdictions shall not be affected thereby, and (ii) such invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement.

      10.13 Specific Performance. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
if any party fails to perform under this Agreement, monetary damages alone may
not be adequate to compensate the other parties for their injuries. Each party
shall, therefore, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to them,
be entitled to seek to obtain specific performance of this Agreement. If any
action, suit, or proceeding is instituted by a party to enforce this Agreement,
the other parties hereby waive the defense that there is

                                       53
<PAGE>

an adequate remedy at law. In the event of a Default by a party that results in
the filing of an action for damages, specific performance, or other remedies,
the winning party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the defaulting party of
all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by it.

      10.14 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in Article

      10.15 Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the rights
and remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any right
or remedy that may be available to any party whether at law, in equity, or
otherwise. No delay, forbearance, or neglect by any party, whether in one or
more instances, in the exercise or any right, power, privilege, or remedy
hereunder or in the enforcement of any term or condition of this Agreement shall
constitute or be construed as a waiver thereof. No waiver of any provision
hereof, or consent required hereunder, or any consent or departure from this
Agreement, shall be valid or binding unless expressly and affirmatively made in
writing and duly executed by the party to be charged with such waiver. No waiver
shall constitute or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver in respect
of any subsequent breach or Default, either of equivalent or different nature,
unless expressly so stated in such writing.

      10.16 Purchaser Obligations. All obligations of the Purchasers contained
herein shall be several, not joint.
