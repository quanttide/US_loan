<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>(a)&nbsp;Definitive Material Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Transaction</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;23, 2004, Fidelity National Financial, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (&#147;FNF&#148;), announced the execution of a definitive Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of December&nbsp;23, 2004 (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;), between
Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF (&#147;FNIS&#148;), FNF, certain affiliates of Thomas H.
Lee Partners, L.P. (&#147;THL&#148; or the &#147;THL Entities&#148;) and certain affiliates of
Texas Pacific Group (&#147;TPG&#148; or the &#147;TPG Entities&#148;). The Purchase Agreement
provides the terms upon which FNIS will sell a 25&nbsp;percent minority equity
interest in FNIS common stock to the THL Entities and the TPG Entities
(collectively, the &#147;Sponsors&#148; or the &#147;Sponsor Group&#148;) for a purchase price of
$500,000,000 (the &#147;Transaction&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed by FNF, a condition to the Transaction is the
consummation of a recapitalization of FNIS. FNF is currently in the
negotiation process with a consortium of lenders regarding the credit facility
to be entered into with respect to the recapitalization plan. Upon the
successful completion of the recapitalization of FNIS, FNF will pay a special
$10 per share cash dividend to FNF stockholders which is anticipated to be
declared and paid during the first quarter of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FNF anticipates the closing of the Transaction to occur following the
recapitalization and payment of the special dividend. As detailed more fully
below, upon consummation of the Transaction, a new FNIS board of directors will
be established. William P. Foley, II, current Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of FNF, will serve as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FNIS.
Following the closing of the Transaction, FNF will have the right to appoint
twelve of the members of the FNIS board of directors and THL and TPG will each
have the right to appoint two members of the FNIS board. THL and TPG have
certain demand registration rights, including rights relating to the
registration of their shares in a public offering of FNIS common stock if
certain criteria are met relating to the potential price and gross proceeds
that would be generated by the public offering. If FNIS has not consummated a
public offering of its common stock within two years of the closing of the
Transaction, the Sponsors have various rights relating to a sale of their
shares of FNIS common stock which are summarized below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement requires the establishment of an option pool for
members of FNIS management to purchase an aggregate 7.5&nbsp;percent of the
fully-diluted shares of FNIS at the same price paid by the Sponsor Group for
their minority equity interest in FNIS. A portion of the option pool will be
subject to time-based, quarterly vesting over four and five-year periods, while
the other portion will be subject to performance-based vesting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Purchase Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides for certain representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnities in connection with the Transaction. The closing of
the Transaction under the Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing
conditions, including conditions related to approvals, expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
consents and waivers, and the closing of the FNIS bank facility on terms
provided for under the Purchase Agreement. In addition to these closing
conditions, the Purchase Agreement also

the Transaction, including the following:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stockholders Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Transaction, FNIS will enter into a Stockholders
Agreement with the Sponsor Group. Under the Stockholders Agreement, following
the closing of the Transaction the parties agree to vote their FNIS shares such
that FNF will have the right to elect up to twelve directors and THL and TPG
will have the right to elect two directors each. In the event that THL or TPG
cease to own at least 50% of the shares held by either of them as of the
closing of the Transaction, they will be entitled to elect only one director.
The Sponsor Group will also have the right to representation on each of the
committees of the FNIS board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the chairman of the FNIS
board shall be elected by a majority vote of the FNIS board; provided that
William P. Foley, II shall serve as a Chairman for an initial period of three
years. The Stockholders Agreement also provides that if the FNIS board
proposes to appoint a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Operating Officer, the Sponsor Group will have a qualified right to veto
the selection of up to three proposed candidates for each position.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stockholders Agreement provides that prior to a public offering of
equity securities of FNIS or any of its subsidiaries, the following actions by
FNIS or any of its subsidiaries will require the approval of the majority of
shares held respectively by THL and by TPG:

</TABLE>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to certain limitations, the Stockholders Agreement provides that
prior to the completion of an initial public offering of equity securities of
FNIS neither FNF nor the Sponsor Group may transfer any of their FNIS common
stock without offering the other parties the right to participate in the sale
on the same terms and conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stockholders Agreement provides the Sponsors with certain liquidity
rights. If FNIS has not consummated a Qualified Public Offering prior to the
second anniversary of the closing of the Transaction, then Sponsors holding at
least 75% of the FNIS shares held by the Sponsors will have the right to notify
FNF of their intent to sell their FNIS shares to FNF, whereupon the parties
will negotiate in good faith the terms of a sale of such shares to FNF or FNIS.
If the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of a sale, the Sponsors may
initiate an appraisal process to determine an appraisal price. If, following
any appraisal process, the Sponsors approve the appraisal price, the Sponsors
may notify FNF and FNIS of their approval, and FNF or FNIS may elect to
purchase for cash such shares at the appraisal price. If the Sponsors approve
the appraisal price, but FNF and FNIS do not elect to purchase or fail to make
an election to purchase the shares, the Sponsors will have the right to compel
a sale of FNIS. If, however, a sale of FNIS does not occur in accordance with
the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, the Sponsors may exchange all
(but not less than all) of their FNIS common stock for the common stock of FNF.
Such exchange would be based upon the appraisal price of the Sponsors&#146; shares
(based on a new appraisal process initiated at the time of exercise of the
exchange) and the fair market value of FNF&#146;s stock, determined by the average
closing price of FNF&#146;s stock for the 45-day trading period immediately prior to
the exchange date. To the extent the number of shares to be received by the
Sponsors at the appraisal price constitutes more than 19.9% of the outstanding
capital stock of FNF (as determined pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange), then the Sponsors will receive the balance in cash as a pro rata
portion of the appraisal price. If following any appraisal process the
Sponsors do not approve the appraisal price, the Sponsors have the right to
initiate the appraisal process two additional times, provided there is a
12-month period between the first election and the second election, and the
second election and the third election.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of the Stockholders Agreement, &#147;Qualified Public
Offering&#148; means a public offering whereby the offered shares trade on a
national securities exchange or NASDAQ, and in which, at the election of FNIS,
either one of the following criteria is fulfilled: (A) (i)&nbsp;the price per share
paid by the public in such offering is at least $15.00 and less than $17.50 and
(ii)&nbsp;the gross proceeds to FNIS would at least equal an amount obtained by
multiplying the per share price in (A)(i) above by that number of shares equal
to 15% of the outstanding shares of FNIS after giving effect to the offering,
or (B) (i)&nbsp;the price per share paid by the public in such offering is at least
$17.50, and (ii)&nbsp;the gross proceeds to FNIS would at least equal an amount
obtained by multiplying the per share price in (B)(i) above by that number of
shares equal to 12.5% of the outstanding shares of FNIS after giving effect to
the offering.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stockholders Agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the
agreement of the parties to terminate the agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the dissolution or
liquidation of FNIS, (iii)&nbsp;the sale of FNIS and (iv)&nbsp;the completion of a public
offering of equity securities of FNIS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Registration Rights Agreement</I>

Agreement also grants certain incidental registration rights to FNF and the
Sponsors. Rights granted under the Registration Rights Agreement are subject
to holdback and other customary restrictions and limitations which are
described in the agreement.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Indemnification Agreements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the closing of the Transaction, FNIS will enter into
Director Indemnification Agreements (collectively, the &#147;Indemnification
Agreements&#148;) with members of the board of directors of FNIS (the
&#147;Indemnitees&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification Agreements, FNIS
will provide the Indemnitees with specific contractual rights to
indemnification against litigation expenses and liabilities, and to the extent
insurance is available, coverage under a director&#146;s liability insurance policy
of FNIS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Noncompetition Agreement</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, FNF has agreed to enter into a
Non-competition and Non-solicitation Agreement with FNIS (the &#147;Noncompetition
Agreement&#148;) as a condition to the closing of the Transaction. Under the terms
of the Noncompetition Agreement, for a period from the date of the agreement
until the first anniversary of the date that FNF ceases to beneficially own at
least a majority of the outstanding capital stock of FNIS, FNF agrees that it
will not, and will cause its affiliates (other than FNIS or its subsidiaries)
not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or control of, other than ownership and
control of FNIS and its subsidiaries, any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in specified
businesses that are competitive with the business of FNIS (a &#147;Competitive
Business&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the
Noncompetition Agreement prevents FNF from: (i)&nbsp;engaging in certain enumerated
activities; (ii)&nbsp;acquiring control of a business which is engaged in a
Competitive Business and continuing to conduct such Competitive Business if FNF
presents the opportunity to make the acquisition to the FNIS board of directors
and (A)&nbsp;FNF&#146;s designees on the FNIS board have voted in favor of FNIS or one of
its subsidiaries making such acquisition and (B)&nbsp;the Sponsors&#146; designees on the
FNIS board have voted against FNIS or any of its subsidiaries making such
investment, provided that, FNF has consummated the acquisition on the same
terms presented to the FNIS board (provided, however, FNF may not conduct any
activities that constitute a Competitive Business through such acquired entity
if such type of activities were not conducted by the acquired entity at the
time of the acquisition); (iii)&nbsp;acquiring control of a business (A)&nbsp;which earns
less than 10% of its annual revenues from engaging in a Competitive Business
(&#147;Minor Competitive Activity&#148;), provided, however that such Minor Competitive
Activity comprises less than 10% of the annual revenues of the acquired
business during the entire term of the Noncompetition Agreement, or (B)&nbsp;which
earns more than 10%, but less than 50% of its annual revenues from engaging in
a Competitive Business (&#147;Divestible Competitive Activity&#148;), provided, however
that such Divestible Competitive Activity shall be offered to FNIS within
thirty days after closing such acquisition at a price equal to that paid by FNF
or, if such price was not separately determined, at fair market value as
determined by mutual consent of the parties or a mutually agreed upon appraisal
process; or (iv)&nbsp;being a passive owner of less than five percent of the
outstanding stock of a corporation which is publicly traded and is engaged in a
Competitive Business.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management Agreements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the closing of the Transaction, FNIS has agreed to
enter into a Management Agreement with THL Managers V, LLC, an affiliate of
THL, and a Management Agreement with TPG GenPar IV, L.P., an affiliate of TPG
(collectively, the &#147;Management Agreements&#148;). Under the terms of the Management
Agreements, certain affiliates of the Sponsors will provide FNIS with advice
and analysis, including advice with respect to debt facilities and arrangements
and other matters (collectively, &#147;Advisory Services&#148;). Each Management
Agreement provides that FNIS will pay the applicable THL or TPG affiliate in
exchange for the Advisory Services: (i)&nbsp;a one time transaction fee of
$12,500,000, payable at the closing of the Transaction, and (ii)&nbsp;an annual
management fee, payable in advance in semi-annual installments beginning at the
closing of the Transaction in an amount per year equal to $1,250,000. Each of
the Management Agreements will terminate on the earlier to occur of five years
after the closing of the Transaction and the consummation of a public offering
of the equity securities of FNIS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>2005 Stock Incentive Plan</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides for FNIS&#146;s adoption of a stock incentive
plan, referred to as the Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. 2005
Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), under which incentive awards consisting of
shares of FNIS common stock or options to purchase shares of FNIS common stock
may be granted to employees, directors and consultants of FNIS and its
subsidiaries. The Plan will become effective upon adoption by the FNIS board,
subject to approval of the majority of FNIS&#146;s Stockholders within twelve months
of its adoption, and will terminate automatically on the day before the tenth
anniversary of its adoption, unless earlier terminated by the FNIS board.
Stock options granted under the Plan may consist of options intended to qualify
as incentive stock options (as that term is defined in Section&nbsp;422 of the
Internal Revenue Code) or options not intended to so qualify. Stock awards may
be granted with or without a purchase price, and may contain vesting and other
terms and conditions, as the Plan&#146;s administrator may determine. The Plan will
be administered by the FNIS board or, at its election, by one or more
committees consisting of one or more members who have been appointed by the
FNIS board. The maximum number of shares of FNIS common stock that may be
issued pursuant to awards under the Plan will be 7.5% of FNIS&#146;s outstanding
common stock, on a fully diluted basis immediately after the closing of the
Transaction, subject to adjustment in connection with certain events or series
of events affecting FNIS&#146;s capital structure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the foregoing share limit and other terms and conditions in the
Plan, the Plan&#146;s administrator is authorized to grant awards under the Plan
from time to time during the term of the Plan and to determine the terms of
such awards; however, it is anticipated that awards respecting most or all of
the shares reserved for issuance under the Plan will be granted at or around
the time of the closing of the Transaction. The exercise price of awards will
be equal to the price per share paid by the Sponsor Group in the Transaction.
Awards will be evidenced by award agreements, which will set forth terms and
conditions of the awards to the extent not set forth in the Plan. Unless a
recipient&#146;s award agreement provides otherwise, the vested portion of a
recipient&#146;s stock options will expire on the earlier of: (i)&nbsp;the expiration of
their term, which will in no event be greater than ten years, (ii)&nbsp;twelve
months following termination of the recipient&#146;s service as a result of death,
disability, retirement, or termination for other than cause, or (iii)&nbsp;the date
of termination of the recipient&#146;s service if the termination is for cause or
voluntary by the recipient. Any unvested portion of a recipient&#146;s options will
expire upon termination of service.

sold in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), and Rule

access to information concerning FNIS&#146;s operations and financial condition, the
investors are acquiring the securities for their own account and not with a
view to the distribution thereof in the absence of an effective registration
statement or an applicable exemption from registration, and that the investors
are accredited investors (as defined by Rule&nbsp;501 under the Securities Act). At
the time of their issuance, the securities will be deemed to be restricted
securities for purposes of the Securities Act, as amended, and the certificates
representing the securities shall bear legends to that effect. Please see

      WHEREAS, Parent desires that the Company undertake such transactions.

      WHEREAS, the shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Purchasers
hereunder are referred to collectively as the "Shares."

      WHEREAS, prior to the consummation of the sale of the Shares (the

way of dividend from the Company to Parent.

      WHEREAS, in the event that the Initial Financing shall not have been
consummated prior to the time immediately prior to the consummation of the
Transaction, then the Company will be recapitalized in a transaction pursuant to
which, immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will have borrowed an $3.2
billion (and in such event, such borrowing will be deemed hereunder to be the
"Financing") on terms no worse to the Company than those set forth on the

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

corporate power to execute and deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to be executed by it in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Documents") and, subject to the
receipt of the Parent Board Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Company and Parent of this

obligations hereunder and thereunder have been (or at the time of execution will
be) duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part. This
Agreement has been (and each Company Document to which it is a party will be)
duly executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of each of the Company
and Parent and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and
each Company Document by the other party or parties hereto or thereto, this
Agreement and each Company Document to which it is a party shall constitute
valid and binding obligations of the Company and Parent enforceable against the
Company and Parent in accordance with their respective terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other
equivalent Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

or made by or in respect of Parent, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or

(and of each Company Document will not), and neither the performance by the
Company or Parent of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, nor the
consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, will, (i) conflict with the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of

      3.10 Financial Statements. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has
provided to the Purchasers (i) the annual combined balance sheets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related combined
statements of earnings, equity and comprehensive earnings and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003 (the "Annual
Combined Financial Statements"), together with the notes thereto, and the draft
report of KPMG LLP thereon which includes a legend indicating that certain
transactions would have to be completed before KPMG LLP would be in a position
to issue the draft report in final form, (ii) the unaudited combined balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2004 reviewed by KPMG
LLP (the "Interim Balance Sheet"), and the related combined statements of
earnings and cash flows, for the six (6) month period then ended, the "Unaudited
Financial Statements"). The Unaudited Financial Statements, together with the
Annual Combined Financial Statements are referred to as the "Financial
Statements". The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP") and
fairly present the combined financial condition, assets and liabilities, results
of operations, cash flows, and changes in equity and comprehensive earnings of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates, and for the periods, indicated
therein, subject in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements to lack of
footnotes and a statement of changes in equity and comprehensive earnings and
normal year end adjustments that will not be material. Since June 30, 2004,
there has not been any change of the Company's accounting principles, methods,
or policies except as required by GAAP or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a

                                       15
<PAGE>

Material Adverse Effect. The results and accounts of the entities listed on
disclosure Schedule 3.10 are included in the Financial Statements, but have been
excluded from the final formation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and are
therefore, not subject to the terms of this Transaction.

      3.11 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities, Indebtedness. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no Liabilities that are required to be reflected in, reserved
against, or otherwise described in a balance sheet (or the notes thereto)
prepared in accordance with GAAP except (i) those Liabilities provided for or
reserved against in the Financial Statements (or set forth in the notes
thereto), (ii) Liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since June 30, 2004, and (iii) Liabilities under this
Agreement. Immediately after the Closing, other than the Indebtedness for
borrowed money incurred in connection with the Financing and other than with
respect to Capital Leases, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
have any Indebtedness.

      3.12 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth in the Unaudited
Financial Statements and except as contemplated by the Financing, since June 30,
2004, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has: (i) terminated or
suffered any material amendment of any Material Contract; (ii) suffered any
event or circumstance that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, increased the salaries or other compensation of,

executive officers or made any increase in, or any addition to, other benefits
to which any of its current or former directors or executive officers may be
entitled; (iv) declared, set aside, or paid any dividend or made or agreed to
make any other distribution or payment in respect of its Capital Stock or
redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired or agreed to redeem, purchase, or
acquire any of its Capital Stock or other securities; (v) waived any right of
material value to the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (vi) incurred any
Indebtedness.

      3.13 Litigation; Orders. There is no claim or judicial or administrative
action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to Parent's Knowledge,
threatened (i) that questions the validity of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, the performance by the Company or Parent of the
obligations to be performed by it hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (ii) except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, relating to the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as now conducted or as
proposed to be conducted) or materially affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties. There is no
material Order of any Governmental Entity binding on the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets or properties.

      3.14 Compliance with Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
complied in all material respects with each Law and Order binding on it or on
any of its assets or properties and is not currently in material violation of
any such Law or Order,

                                       16
<PAGE>

and there have been no notices or Orders of noncompliance issued to the Company
of any of its Subsidiaries under or in respect of any such Law.

      3.15 Permits. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns, holds,
possesses, or lawfully uses in its business all approvals, authorizations,
certifications, franchises, licenses, permits, and equivalent authorities
("Permits") that are necessary for the conduct of their business as currently
conducted or the ownership and use of their assets or properties, in compliance
with all Laws, except for those Permits the failure to obtain or loss of which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in Default under, or has received any
notice of any claim of Default in respect of, any such Permits, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To Parent's
Knowledge, all such Permits are renewable by their respective terms in the
ordinary course of business without the need to comply with any special
qualification procedures or to pay any amounts other than routine filing fees.

      3.16 Contracts. Schedule 3.16 sets forth all of the following Contracts to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound:
(i) Contracts with any labor union or association representing any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) Contracts for the sale of any of
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary

or any of its Subsidiaries to make payments in the future in excess of $250,000
individually or $750,000 in the aggregate. All of the Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound are in
full force and effect and are the legal, valid, and binding obligations of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries, enforceable against them in accordance with
their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and equivalent Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, in any
respect under any Contract of the Company and its Subsidiaries, nor, to Parent's
Knowledge, is any other party to any such Contract in default thereunder in any
respect.

      (b) The Company or its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive owner of all

to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Intellectual Property owned, used,
practiced or otherwise commercially exploited by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with, their businesses as presently conducted (the "Company

misappropriation of any Patent, Copyright, trade secret or other equivalent
right, of any Person and do not infringe, constitute an unauthorized use of, or
violate any other right of any Person. The Intellectual Property owned by or
licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or as to which the Company or its

the performance of the services offered by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the ordinary course of its respective businesses as presently conducted do not
currently infringe, and have not infringed, upon any Patent, Copyright or trade
secret right of any third party.

Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken adequate security measures to
protect the secrecy and confidentiality of all trade secrets and any other
material confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries which

the whole, as provided in the Company's documentation, and (ii) there are no
errors in any documentation, specifications, manuals, and user guides associated
with or used or produced in the development, maintenance or marketing of the

employment (other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title
I of ERISA or comparable state or local Laws and at the former employee's or his
or her beneficiary's sole expense).

      (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, each of the Employee Benefit Plans intended to qualify under
Section 401 of the Code ("Qualified Plans") so qualify and the trusts maintained
thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code,
and, to Parent's Knowledge, nothing has occurred in respect of the operation of
any such plan that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or
the imposition of any liability, penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code.

      (c) All contributions and premiums required by Law or by the terms of any
Employee Benefit Plan have been timely made (without regard to any waivers
granted in respect thereof) to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith, and no accumulated funding deficiencies exist in any of
such plans subject to Section 412 of the Code.

      (d) The benefit liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA),
of each of the Employee Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA using the
actuarial assumptions that would be used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") in the event it terminated each such plan do not exceed
the fair market value of the assets of each such plan. The liabilities of each
Employee Benefit Plan that has been terminated or otherwise wound up, have been
fully discharged in full compliance with applicable Law.

      (e) During the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, no "reportable
event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended has
occurred with

                                       23
<PAGE>

respect to any of the Employee Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, nor
has any event requiring notice to be provided under Section 4041(c)(3)(C) or
4063(a) of ERISA.

      (f) There has been no violation of ERISA in respect of the filing of
applicable returns, reports, documents, and notices regarding any of the
Employee Benefit Plans with the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of the
Treasury or the furnishing of such notices or documents to the participants or
beneficiaries of the Employee Benefit Plans or Pension Plans that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      (g) True and complete copies of the following documents, in respect of
each of the Employee Benefit Plans that, after the Closing, the Company or any
if its Subsidiaries will maintain, contribute to, or have any liability with
respect to (as applicable), have been delivered to Purchaser (i) any plans and
related trust documents, and all amendments thereto, (ii) the most recent Forms
5500 for the past three years and schedules thereto, (iii) the most recent
financial statements and actuarial valuations for the past three years, (iv) the
most recent IRS determination letter, (v) the most recent summary plan
descriptions (including letters or other documents updating such descriptions),

such Employee Benefit Plans.

      (h) There is no pending claim, action, suit, or proceeding that has been
asserted or instituted against any Employee Benefit Plan , the assets of any
such plans, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or the plan administrator or
any fiduciary of the Employee Benefit Plans in respect of the operation of such
plans (other than routine, uncontested benefit claims) and no Employee Benefit
Plan is under audit or is the subject of any audit or investigation by any
Governmental Entity, and there are no facts or circumstances that could form the
basis for any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or audit, in each case,
except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

      (i) Each of the Employee Benefit Plans has been maintained, in all
material respects, in accordance with its terms and all provisions of applicable
Law. All amendments and actions required to bring each of the Employee Benefit
Plans into conformity in all material respects with all of the applicable
provisions of ERISA and other applicable Laws have been made or taken except to
the extent that such amendments or actions are not required by Law to be made or
taken until a date after the Closing Date. Except to the extent it would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur,
either directly or indirectly (including as a result of an indemnification
obligation), any liability under Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty, excise
tax or joint and several liability provisions of the Code or any foreign law or
regulation relating to employee benefit plans (including, without limitation,
Section 406, 409, 502(i), 502(1), 4069 or 42 12(c) of ERISA, or Section 4971,
4975 or 4976 of the Code), or under any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or
legal requirement pursuant to or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan has agreed to
indemnify or is required to indemnify any person against

                                       24
<PAGE>

liability incurred under, or for a violation or failure to satisfy the
requirements of any such legal requirement, and to the knowledge of the Company,
no event, transaction or condition has occurred, exists or is expected to occur
which could result in any such liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing.

      (j) The Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and any ERISA Affiliate that
maintains a "benefits plan" (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of ERISA)
have complied with the notice and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and the applicable regulations
thereunder, except to the extent that failure to so comply would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      (k) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any ERISA Affiliate or
any organization to which any is a successor or parent corporation, has divested
any business or entity maintaining or sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan
having unfunded benefit liabilities (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(18)
of ERISA) or transferred any such plan to any Person other than the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate during the five-year period ending
on the Closing Date.

      (l) To Parent's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" in respect of the Employee
Benefit Plans has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      (m) None of the Company, any Subsidiary, or any ERISA Affiliate has
terminated any Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or incurred
any outstanding liability under Section 4062 of ERISA to the PBGC or to a
trustee appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA and no Person (including without
limitation the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) has instituted any
proceeding to terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan or appoint a
trustee to administer any such Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan, in each
case, except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

      (n) Other than the granting of stock options pursuant to the Stock
Incentive Plan, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment becoming due to any employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan or
Pension Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any such benefits.

      (o) No stock or other security issued by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries forms or has formed a material part of the assets of any Employee
Benefit Plan.

      (p) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
Person that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any
amount after the

                                       25
<PAGE>

Closing Date by the Company or any Subsidiary that would not be deductible by
the party making such payment by reason of Section 280G of the Code, or would
constitute compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 162(m)
of the Code.

      (q) Except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign Plan, to the extent requiring
qualification under any applicable governmental laws or authority, is so
qualified. According to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used for the purposes of funding each Foreign Plan (or, if the same has no such
assumptions and valuations or is unfunded, according to actuarial assumptions
and valuations in use by the PBGC on the date hereof), as of October 12, 2004
the total amount or value of the funds available under each such Foreign Plan to
pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such benefits,
together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeded the present
value of all benefits (contingent or otherwise) accrued as of such date of all
participants and past participants therein in respect of which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has or would have after the Closing Date any obligation.
For purposes hereof, the term "Foreign Plan" shall mean an Employee Benefit Plan
with respect to current or former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries employed outside the United States.

      (d) To Parent's Knowledge, no officer or key employee, or any group of key
employees, currently intends to terminate his, her, or their employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The employment of each officer and U.S.

Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be. To Parent's Knowledge, no
officer, employee, agent, or consultant of the Company or any of its

Liabilities.

      (e) There is no investigation of the business, operations, or Real
Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Parent's Knowledge,

of which is true and correct as of the date hereof:

      4.1 Organization. Such Purchaser is a limited partnership, corporation or

under the Laws of the state of its incorporation or formation, as the case may
be.

or limited liability company power, as the case may be, to execute and deliver

The execution and delivery by such Purchaser of this Agreement and each
Purchaser Document and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder have been (or at the time of execution will be) duly authorized by
all necessary partnership, corporate or limited liability company action, as the
case may be, on the part of such Purchaser. This Agreement has been (and each
Purchaser Document will be) duly executed and delivered by such Purchaser and,
assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Purchaser
Document by the other party or parties hereto or thereto, constitutes or will

valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser enforceable against such
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other equivalent Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights in general and subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity).

      4.3 Consents and Approvals. Except as would not have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, no consent, approval, waiver, order, or authorization of, or

obligations hereunder and thereunder, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, other than the filing of premerger notification
and report forms under the HSR Act and any required filings with insurance
authorities in New York State.

      4.4 No Conflicts. Except as would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not (and each
Purchaser Document will not), and neither the performance by such Purchaser of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will (i) conflict with the
organizational and partnership documents of such Purchaser or (ii) violate any
Order of any Governmental Entity or Law applicable to such Purchaser.

the Shares for investment for its own account, and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Such Purchaser (either alone

risks of its investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic
risks of such investment. Such Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined
in Rule 501(a) of Registration D under the Securities Act. Such Purchaser
understands and acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act, or the securities Laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction and,
unless so registered, may not be offered, sold, transferred, or otherwise
disposed of except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable securities Laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction. THL further

covered by the Intercompany Agreements shall include, but shall not be limited
to, corporate services provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, payroll, employee benefits
and human resources, insurance, expense reimbursement and legal) ("Corporate
Services"), software licenses, information technology ("IT"), intellectual
property cross licenses, joint ownership and development, agency, starter
repository access, title plant maintenance and title plant access (collectively,

negotiate in good faith to complete the Intercompany Agreements as contemplated
by this Section 5.3. The Intercompany Agreements shall provide that the costs of
the Corporate Services to and from the

                                       34
<PAGE>

Company shall be at each party's cost of providing such services; provided that,
in the case of the Corporate Services provided to the Company, in no event shall
the cost of such services per year exceed an amount equal to (A) $50,000,000

party. The Parent will agree to provide the Corporate Services (and unless
earlier terminated by the Purchasers) to the Company at all times prior to six
months following the earlier to occur of (i) a Public Offering, and (ii) a Sale
of the Company (as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement). It is anticipated
that any one Corporate Service may be terminated without terminating any other
Corporate Service under the relevant Agreement. The initial term of the agency
agreement shall be 10 years. The initial term of the Title Plant agreement shall
be 10 years. The initial term of the agreement pursuant to which the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries will provide IT services to Parent and its other

Parent. The licensing to the Company and its Subsidiaries of rights to the name
"Fidelity" shall be on a royalty-free basis, and for an initial 20-year term.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties will cooperate and
use reasonable best efforts to agree upon terms designed to facilitate the
Purchasers' objectives with respect to the extension or termination of any
Intercompany Agreement or portions thereof upon a Sale of the Company or a
Public Offering.

      5.4 All Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done,

the contrary in this Section 5.5, the Parent and the Company shall not be
required to agree to (i) the divestiture (including through a licensing
arrangement) by the Parent or any of the Parent's Subsidiaries (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) of any of their respective businesses, product
lines or assets, or (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any
of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets,

in connection with any filing under the HSR Act shall be expenses of the
Purchasers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in obtaining any
consent required hereunder, the Purchasers shall not be required to consent to

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                          Survival and Indemnification

      8.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants.

      (a) The representations and warranties of the Parent and the Purchasers
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto
shall survive until the date that is 45 days after receipt by the Purchasers of
the consolidated audited financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005 (provided, however,
that representations and warranties made in Sections 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8,
3.21, the third sentence of 3.22(i), 4.2, 4.5 and 4.6 shall survive until sixty
(60) days after any applicable statute of limitations or indefinitely if no such
statute of limitations is applicable). Any claim for indemnification in respect
of any representation or warranty that is not asserted by notice given as herein
provided relating thereto prior to the expiration of the specified period of
survival shall not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after the
expiration of such period of survival. Any claim for an Indemnifiable Loss in
respect of such a breach asserted within such period of survival as herein
provided will be timely made for purposes hereof.

      (b) Unless a specified period is set forth in this Agreement (in which
event such specified period will control), the covenants in this Agreement will
survive and remain in effect indefinitely.

      8.2 Indemnification.

      (a) Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Purchasers, the
Company and their Affiliates (provided however that the Parent shall not be
obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates
at any time after the Purchasers no longer hold any of the Shares (including any
equity securities into which such shares may subsequently be converted or
exchanged into)) from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent
relating to, resulting from, or arising out of:

            (i) any breach of representation or warranty of Parent under this
      Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection herewith;

            (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of
      the Company or Parent under this Agreement;

            (iii) any and all Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries (A) for any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) that
      ends on or before the Closing Date (except, with respect to any particular
      Tax, to the extent the amount of such Tax has been (1) paid, (2) accrued
      on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
      dated November 30, 2004 previously delivered to Purchasers by Parent, (3)
      accrued in the financial statements delivered to Purchasers pursuant to
      Section 5.11 (the "Accruals") (provided that such Accruals are made
      consistent with past practice, in accordance with GAAP

                                       44
<PAGE>

      and reflect only Taxes properly allocable to the Company and its
      Subsidiaries (as opposed to FNF and its Subsidiaries, other than the
      Company and its Subsidiaries) and including any amounts distributed under
      clause (i) of 5.2(b)(ix) (B) to the extent such distributions exceed the
      amounts accrued on the November 30, 2004 or the Accruals, or (4) with
      respect to the period commencing the last day of the month immediately
      preceding the Closing Date through the Closing Date, Taxes incurred in the
      ordinary course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries), (B)
      under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any similar provision of
      Law) by reason of being a member of any Affiliated Group on or before the
      Closing Date. Parent shall, unless prohibited by applicable Law, cause the
      Company and its Subsidiaries to close the taxable period of the Company
      and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If
      applicable Law does not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
      close its taxable year on the Closing Date, the amount of such Taxes
      allocable to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall
      (i) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income or gross
      receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
      relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of
      any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or gross
      receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
      multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in
      the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
      of which is the number of days in the entire period. Any allocation of
      income or deductions required to determine any Taxes relating to a such
      period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
      ended on the Closing Date and by means of a closing of the books and
      records of the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, as of the close
      of the Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions
      that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,
      depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
      period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
      proportion to the number of days in each such period.

            (iv) Title IV of ERISA solely as a result of the Company being or
having been an ERISA Affiliate of Parent.

      The Purchasers shall determine, in their sole discretion, as to whether
the Company, the Purchasers, or any other party entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 8.2(a) shall be the recipient of indemnification
payments made hereunder.

      (b) Purchasers shall severally, but not jointly, indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless the Company, the Parent and their Affiliates from and against any
and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent relating to, resulting from, or
arising out of:

            (i) any breach of representation or warranty of such Purchaser under
this Agreement; and

                                       45
<PAGE>

            (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of
such Purchaser under this Agreement.

      (c) For purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation and
warranty has occurred and for purposes of determining the amount of any
Indemnifiable Loss for all purposes under this Article VIII, each representation
and warranty contained in this Agreement (other than the representation in
Section 3.12(ii)) shall be read without regard to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifier contained therein.

      8.3 Deductible; Maximum Liability. Neither Parent nor the Purchasers shall
be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless their respective Indemnitees under
Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Indemnifiable Losses by the Indemnitees under such Section 8.2(a)(i) or
Section 8.2(b)(i), as the case may be, exceeds $30.0 million for all
Indemnifiable Losses (the "Deductible"), at which point Parent or the
Purchasers, as the case may be, shall be liable to their respective Indemnitees
for the value of the Indemnitee's claims under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section
8.2(b)(i), as the case may be, that is in excess of the Deductible, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VIII . The maximum aggregate liability
of each of Parent and the Purchasers (considered together in the case of the
Purchasers), as the case may be, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all
Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article VIII shall be $250.0 million (the
"Cap"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the
Deductible nor the Cap shall apply with respect to Indemnifiable Losses to the
extent relating to, resulting from, or arising out of (x) any breach or
nonfulfillment of any agreement or any covenant contained in this Agreement, (y)
any breach of representation or warranty contained in any of Sections 3.2, 3.5,
3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.21, the third sentence of 3.22(i), 4.2, 4.5 and 4.6, or any
Indemnifiable Loss under Section 8.2(a)(iii); provided, however, that Parent
shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnitee hereunder
for a breach of Section 3.21 or for any Indemnifiable Loss relating to,
resulting from, or arising out of clause (A) of Section 8.2(a)(iii), unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such Indemnifiable Losses under such Section
3.21 and Section 8.2(a)(iii) exceeds $250,000 and then only to the extent of the
Purchase Price, or (z) any Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or
arising out of ERISA matters set forth in Section 8.1(a)(iv).

      8.4 Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

      (i) "Indemnitee" means any person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

      (ii) "Indemnitor" means any person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement;

      (iii) "Indemnifiable Losses" means any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs, and expenses, and any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits, proceedings, or investigations or appeals by any Person,
including the costs and expenses of any and all assessments, judgments,
settlements, and compromises relating thereto but

                                       46
<PAGE>

not including attorneys' fees and expenses in respect thereof and in respect of
establishing the right to indemnification hereunder; provided, however that any
Indemnity Payment (x) made to the Purchasers shall be prorated to reflect only
the Purchasers then percentage ownership interest in the Company, and, shall in
no event include any special or punitive damages (unless in connection with a
Third Party Claim), and (y) shall be net of any (A) amounts actually recovered
(after deducting related costs and expenses) or recoverable by the Indemnitee
for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is made under any
insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any Person other than a party
hereto, and (B) Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnitee in respect of
any Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is made.

      (iv) "Indemnity Payment" means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required
to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

      (v) "Third-Party Claim" means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made
or brought by any person that is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate
of a party to this Agreement.

      8.5 Procedures for Third-Party Claims.

      (a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third-Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor may
be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee
shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in no event
later than 30 days after becoming aware) thereof; provided, however, that no
delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve
the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the
extent) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such delay.

      (b) Any Indemnitor will have the right to defend the Indemnitee against
the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee so long as (i) the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitee has given notice of the Third-Party
Claim that the Indemnitor will indemnify the Indemnitee from and against any
such Indemnifiable Losses, (ii) the Indemnitor provides the Indemnitee with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor will have
the financial resources to defend against the Third-Party Claim and, (iii) the
Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and
diligently; provided, that, in the event settlement of, or an adverse judgment
in respect of, a Third-Party Claim, is likely, in the good faith judgment of a
Purchaser who is an Indemnitee hereunder, to adversely affect the reputation or
business of such Purchaser or its Affiliates, such Purchaser shall have the
right to defend, at its expense, against such Third-Party Claim with the counsel
of its choice. The Purchasers may also participate in defense of any other
Third-Party Claim at their expense.

      (c) So long as the Indemnitor is conducting the defense of the Third-Party
Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b), (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate
co-

                                       47
<PAGE>

counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement in respect of the
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which
consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or withheld), and (iii)
the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement in respect of the Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent will not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed, or withheld); provided, however, that, in respect of
clause (iii) above, the Indemnitee may condition such consent upon the delivery
by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a duly executed unconditional
release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third-Party
Claim.

      (d) In the event any condition set forth in Section 8.4(b) is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnitee may defend against, and consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement in respect of, the
Third-Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate, provided
that the Indemnitee will consult with and obtain the consent of the Indemnitor
in connection therewith which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or
withheld, (ii) the Indemnitor will reimburse the Indemnitee promptly and
periodically for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnitor will remain
responsible for any Indemnifiable Losses the Indemnitee may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by, the
Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 8.4.

      8.6 Direct Claims. The Indemnitor will have a period of thirty (30) days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account of
an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim"). If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the
Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the
Indemnitee will be entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnitee. In any case where the Purchasers are the Indemnitees, the Purchasers
may bring the claim on behalf of the Purchasers or the Company, in their sole
discretion.

      8.7 Sole Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, if the
Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing with
respect to any and all claims arising out of or related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in
this Article VIII; provided, however that nothing contained herein shall prevent
an Indemnitee from bringing a claim based on fraud.

      8.8 Certain Other Matters. Upon making any Indemnity Payment, Indemnitor
will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all rights of
Indemnitee against any third person (other than an insurance company) in respect
of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity Payment related; provided,
however, that (i) Indemnitor shall then be in compliance with its obligations
under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and (ii) until
Indemnitee fully recovers its

                                       48
<PAGE>

Indemnifiable payment, any and all claims of the Indemnitor against any such
third person on account of such Indemnity Payment will be subrogated and
subordinated in right of payment to Indemnitee's rights against such third
person. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof,
each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described
subrogation and subordination rights. Any Indemnity Payment hereunder shall be
treated as an adjustment to the applicable purchase price.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   Termination

      prohibiting or restraining the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated hereby or any material part hereof;

            (c) by the non-breaching party if another party shall have breached
      or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
      warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement,
      which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
      condition to the terminating party's obligations as set forth in Article
      VI, and (B) such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being or has
      not been cured by the breaching party within 20 calendar days after giving
      written notice to the breaching party of such breach or failure to
      perform; provided, however that with respect to any breach of the No MAE
      Reps, the Parent shall have the right for 10 business days following the
      receipt of notice from the Purchasers Representatives of their intent to
      terminate this Agreement pursuant to this section, to attempt to cure such
      breach prior to the Purchasers being deemed to have any right to terminate
      this Agreement pursuant to this section;

            (d) by Parent and the Company if any Restraint having any of the
      effects set forth in Section 5.5 shall be in effect and shall have become
      final and nonappealable (provided that the right to terminate this
      Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to any party
      who has materially breached any representation, warranty or failed to
      fulfill any obligation under this Agreement)

            (e) by the Purchasers if the Parent Board Approval is not obtained
      by January 7, 2005; and

                                       49
<PAGE>

            (f) by Purchasers or Parent on or after May 31, 2005, if the Closing
      has not occurred prior to such date; provided that the right to terminate
      this Agreement under this Section 9.1(f) shall not be available to any
      party who has materially breached any representation, warranty or failed
      to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement ;and provided further that
      if the only condition yet to be satisfied as of May 31, 2005 is the
      approval of the New York State Insurance Department, this date shall be
      automatically extended until July 31, 2005.

      The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b),
9.1(c), or 9.1(d) shall promptly give written notice of such termination to the
other party.

      9.2 Effect of Termination. Except for Section 5.6, 5.9 and this Section
9.2 and Article X which shall survive any termination of this Agreement, upon
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
become null and void and of no further force and effect and all obligations of
the parties hereto shall terminate and there shall be no liability or obligation
of any party hereto; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any
party hereto from liability for its default under or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement under this Agreement prior to
such termination (other than a failure to obtain the Parent Board Approval;
provided a Board meeting of Parent has been held in accordance with Section
5.12).

that any Purchaser may, without obtaining the prior written consent of any other
party, assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations
hereunder to any Affiliate of such Purchaser so long as such Affiliate joins as
a Purchaser party hereto. Any attempted assignment, delegation, or transfer in
violation of this Section 10.2 shall be void and of no force or effect.

           Facsimile: (212) 225-3999

      Notice shall be deemed given, received, and effective on: (i) if given by
personal delivery or courier service, the date of actual receipt by the
receiving party, or if delivery is refused on the date delivery was first
attempted; (ii) if given by certified mail, the third day after being so mailed
if posted with the United States Postal Service; and (iii) if given by
facsimile, the date on which the facsimile is transmitted if confirmed by
transmission report during the transmitter's normal business hours, or at the
beginning of the next business day after transmission if confirmed at any time
other than the transmitter's normal business hours. Any person entitled to
notice may change any address or facsimile number to which notice is to be given
to it by giving notice of such change of address or facsimile number as provided
in this Section 10.11. The inability to deliver notice because of changed
address or facsimile number of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be
receipt of the notice as of the date such attempt was first made.

      10.11 No Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, each party hereto agrees that absent fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation, neither it nor any person acting on its behalf
may assert any claim or cause of action against any officer, director,
stockholder, controlling person, manager, member, partner, employer, agent,
representative, or Affiliate of any other party nor their respective officers,
directors, stockholders, controlling persons, managers, members, partners,
employees, agents, or representatives in connection with, arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

      10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held (by a court of
competent jurisdiction) to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under the
applicable Law of any jurisdiction, (i) the remainder of this Agreement or the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances or in other
jurisdictions shall not be affected thereby, and (ii) such invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement.

      10.13 Specific Performance. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
if any party fails to perform under this Agreement, monetary damages alone may
not be adequate to compensate the other parties for their injuries. Each party
shall, therefore, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to them,
be entitled to seek to obtain specific performance of this Agreement. If any
action, suit, or proceeding is instituted by a party to enforce this Agreement,
the other parties hereby waive the defense that there is

                                       53

an adequate remedy at law. In the event of a Default by a party that results in
the filing of an action for damages, specific performance, or other remedies,
the winning party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the defaulting party of
all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by it.

      10.14 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in Article
VIII, nothing express or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective permitted assigns any rights or remedies under of by reason of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

      10.15 Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the rights
and remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any right
or remedy that may be available to any party whether at law, in equity, or
otherwise. No delay, forbearance, or neglect by any party, whether in one or
more instances, in the exercise or any right, power, privilege, or remedy
hereunder or in the enforcement of any term or condition of this Agreement shall
constitute or be construed as a waiver thereof. No waiver of any provision
hereof, or consent required hereunder, or any consent or departure from this
Agreement, shall be valid or binding unless expressly and affirmatively made in
writing and duly executed by the party to be charged with such waiver. No waiver
shall constitute or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver in respect
of any subsequent breach or Default, either of equivalent or different nature,
unless expressly so stated in such writing.

      10.16 Purchaser Obligations. All obligations of the Purchasers contained
herein shall be several, not joint.

Stockholder, and this Agreement constitutes a legal and binding obligation of
such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its
terms; and

                  (c) the execution, delivery and performance by such

lapse of time, or both, (i) violate any provision of law, statute, rule or
regulation to which such Stockholder is subject, (ii) violate any order,
judgment or decree applicable to such Stockholder or (iii) conflict with, or
result in a breach or default under, any term or condition of any agreement or

                                   ARTICLE II
                         VOTING AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

                  2.1 Election of Directors; Committees.

                  (a) Each Person, other than the Company, that is a party to
this Agreement hereby agrees that such Person will vote, or cause to be voted,
all voting Shares of the Company over which such Person has the power to vote or
direct the voting, and will take all other necessary or desirable actions within

and cause to be continued in office, the following individuals, in each case
subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b) below:

                  (i)      one (1) director designated by Thomas H. Lee Equity
                           Fund V, L.P. and one (1) director designated by
                           Thomas H. Lee Parallel Fund V, L.P. (collectively,
                           the "THL Directors"), who shall initially be Thomas
                           M. Hagerty and Seth Lawry and who shall be such
                           directors so long as they

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

                           are principals of THL (or equivalent or higher
                           ranking employees of THL), provided that any
                           directors replacing the initial THL Directors shall
                           always be individuals who are principals of THL (or
                           equivalent or higher ranking employees of THL);

                  (ii)     two (2) directors designated by TPG Partners IV, L.P.
                           (the "TPG Directors"), who shall initially be
                           Jonathan Coslet and Marshall Haines and who shall be
                           such directors so long as they are principals of TPG
                           (or equivalent or higher ranking employees of TPG),
                           provided that any directors replacing the initial TPG
                           Directors shall always be individuals who are
                           principals of TPG (or equivalent or higher ranking
                           employees of TPG) ; and

                  (iii)    up to twelve (12) directors designated by Parent
                           representing the proportional amount of Shares held
                           by Parent at the relevant time (the "Parent
                           Directors"); provided that, it is acknowledged that
                           any number of the director seats to be filled by the
                           Parent at any time may remain vacant until such time
                           as the Parent elects to fill such seats.

                  (b) If at any time THL or TPG ceases to own at least 50% of
the Shares held by it as of the date hereof (subject to adjustment for stock
splits, combinations and similar events), the number of directors THL or TPG, as
the case may be, is entitled to designate shall be decreased by one. In the
event such decrease results in an undesignated Board seat, the remaining Board
members may designate, by majority vote, a successor director to fill the
vacancy created thereby or decrease the size of the Board by such seats.

                  (c) The chairman of the Board (the "Chairman") shall be
elected by a majority vote of the Board; provided, however, that William P.
Foley, II shall serve as the Chairman for an initial period of three (3) years
provided he continues to be employed by the Company as Chief Executive Officer.

                  (d) The Board shall hold no less than one (1) meeting per
fiscal quarter. At each meeting of the Board (or committee thereof) at which a
quorum is present, each director shall be entitled to one vote on each matter to
be voted on at such meeting. A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum.

                  (e) If at any time any director ceases to serve on the Board
(whether due to resignation, removal or otherwise), the Stockholders shall elect
a successor to fill the vacancy created thereby on the terms and subject to the
conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above. Each Person that is a party hereto
agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all voting Shares of the Company over
which such Person has the power to vote or direct the voting, and shall take all
such other actions as shall be necessary or desirable to cause the designated
successor to be elected to fill such vacancy.

                  (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impair any
rights that the stockholders of the Company may have to remove any director for
cause under applicable law,

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

the certificate of incorporation of the Company, or the by-laws of the Company,
as the case may be. No such removal of an individual designated pursuant to this
Section 2.1 for cause shall affect any of the Stockholders' rights to designate
a different individual pursuant to this Section 2.1 to fill the position from
which such individual was removed.

                  (g) Each member of the Board shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Company for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including travel) incurred in attending any Board meeting.

                  (h) For so long as a Sponsor has any designees on the Board,
the Company shall obtain and maintain directors and officers liability insurance
with coverage of at least $50,000,000 and of a scope that is customary for
companies equivalent to the Company in terms of size and industry. The Company
shall indemnify the directors designated by the Sponsors in accordance with the
Company's certificate of incorporation and each indemnification agreement
entered into by the Company and such director.

                  (i) There shall be established at all times during the term of
this Agreement a Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation
Committee") which shall be comprised of up to five (5) directors as follows: one
(1) of whom shall be one of the THL Directors, one (1) of whom shall be one of
the TPG Directors and three (3) of whom shall be Parent Directors, provided
that, one (1) of the Parent Directors shall be an independent director selected
by Parent who shall not be an employee of Parent. The Compensation Committee
will (i) determine the compensation of all senior employees and consultants of
the Company (including salary, bonus, equity participation and benefits)
consistent with compensation of companies similar to the Company and (ii)
approve the grants of any options under, or amendments to or replacement of, the
Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan; provided that no member of the
Compensation Committee may vote on his own compensation or option grant. The
initial members of the Compensation Committee shall be William P. Foley, II,
Thomas M. Hagerty and Jonathan Coslet and two other individuals designated by
Parent in accordance with the provisions in this clause (i).

                  (j) There shall be established at all times during the term of
this Agreement an Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") which
shall be comprised of THL Directors, TPG Directors and Parent Directors
representing the proportional amount of Shares held by THL, TPG and Parent,
respectively. The Audit Committee shall determine the Company's audit policies,
review audit reports and recommendations made by the Company's internal audit
staff and its independent auditors, meet with the Company's independent
auditors, oversee the independent auditors, and recommend the Company's
engagement of independent auditors.

                  (k) All other committees that may be established by the Board
from time to time shall be comprised of up to five (5) directors as follows: one
(1) of whom shall be one of the THL Directors, one (1) of whom shall be one of
the TPG Directors and three (3) of whom shall be Parent Directors, provided
that, one (1) of the Parent Directors shall be an independent director selected
by Parent who shall not be an employee of Parent.

or otherwise in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement.

                  (b) No Transfer of any Shares by any Stockholder shall become
effective unless and until the Transferee (unless such Transferee already is
party to this Agreement) executes and delivers to the Company a counterpart to
this Agreement, agreeing to be treated in the same manner as the transferring
Stockholder. Upon such Transfer and such execution and delivery, the Transferee
acquiring Transferred Shares shall be bound by, and entitled to the benefits of,
this Agreement in the same manner as the transferring Stockholder; provided that
no Transferee of a Sponsor (other than pursuant to the second sentence of the
definition of an Exempt Transfer) shall be entitled to any of the rights of the
Sponsor set forth in this Agreement (or the benefits hereunder) other than
Section 3.2, Article V, Article VI, Section 7.2, Article VIII and Article IX
hereof. Any attempted Transfer of Shares by any Stockholder not in accordance
with this Section 3.1 shall not be effective and shall be void.

                  (c) No Shares may be transferred by a Stockholder (other than
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act) unless
such Stockholder first delivers to the Company an opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the
effect that such Transfer is not required to be registered under the Securities
Act.

                  3.2      Tag-Along Rights.

                  (a) At any time after the date of this Agreement, if any
Sponsor or Parent (the "Selling Holder") proposes to Transfer any such Shares to
a third party, the Selling Holder shall, before such Transfer:

                  (i)      Deliver to the Company and to the other Stockholders
                           (the "Other Holders") at least thirty (30) days prior
                           written notice of such proposed Transfer (the "Sale
                           Notice") and the terms of such Transfer, including
                           (A) the number of shares of Common Stock to which the
                           Transfer relates (the "Offered Shares"), (B) the name
                           and address of the proposed Transferee, (C) the
                           proposed amount and type of consideration (including,
                           if the consideration consists in whole or in part of
                           non-cash consideration, such information available to
                           the Selling Holder as may be reasonably necessary for
                           the other Stockholders to properly analyze the
                           economic value and investment risk of such non-cash
                           consideration) and the terms and conditions of
                           payment proposed by the Selling Holder.

                  (ii)     Any of the Other Holders may, within twenty-five (25)
                           days of the receipt of the Sale Notice, give written
                           notice (each, a "Tag-Along Notice") to the Selling
                           Holder that such Other Holder wishes to participate
                           in such proposed Transfer upon the terms and
                           conditions set forth in the Sale Notice, which
                           Tag-Along Notice shall specify the Shares such Other
                           Holder desires to include in such proposed Transfer;
                           provided, however, that (1) each Other Holder shall
                           be required, as a condition to being permitted to
                           sell Shares pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) in
                           connection with a Transfer of Offered Shares, to sell
                           a number of shares equal to the product of its Pro
                           Rata Amount and the number of Offered Shares, (2) to
                           exercise its tag-along rights hereunder, each Other
                           Holder must agree to make to the Transferee on behalf
                           of itself the same representations, warranties,
                           covenants, indemnities and agreements as the Selling
                           Holder agrees to make in connection with the Transfer
                           of the Offered Shares (except that in the case of
                           representations and warranties pertaining
                           specifically to, or covenants made specifically by,
                           the Selling Holder, the Other Holders shall make
                           comparable representations and warranties pertaining
                           specifically to (and, as applicable, covenants by)
                           themselves), and must agree to bear its ratable share
                           (which shall be proportionate based on the value of
                           Shares that are Transferred) of all liabilities to
                           the Transferees arising out of representations,
                           warranties (other than those representations,

                           agreements made in connection with the Transfer. Each
                           Stockholder will bear (x) its own costs of any sale
                           of Shares pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) and (y) its
                           pro-rata share (based upon the relative amount of
                           Shares sold) of any of the other costs of any
                           reasonable and customary sale of Shares pursuant to
                           this Section 3.2(a) to the extent such costs are
                           incurred for the benefit of all Stockholders and are
                           not otherwise paid by the Transferee.

                  (b) If none of the Other Holders gives the Selling Holder a
Tag-Along Notice prior to the expiration of the 25-day period for giving
Tag-Along Notices with respect to the Transfer proposed in the Sale Notice, then
(notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 3.2(a)) the Selling Holder
may Transfer such Offered Shares on the terms and conditions set forth, and to
or among any of the Transferees identified (or Affiliates of Transferees
identified), in the Sale Notice at any time within ninety (90) days after
expiration of the 25-day period for giving Tag-Along Notices with respect to
such Transfer. Any such Offered Shares not Transferred by the Selling Holder
during such 90-day period will again be subject to the provisions of this
Section 3.2(a) upon subsequent Transfer. If one or more Other Holders give the
Selling Holder a timely Tag-Along Notice, then the Selling Holder shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of the prospective Transferee(s) to
the participation of the Other Holders in any contemplated Transfer, on the same
terms and conditions as are applicable to the Offered Shares, and no Selling
Holder shall transfer any of its shares to any prospective Transferee if such
prospective Transferee(s) declines to allow the participation of the Other
Holders.

                  (c) The rights and restrictions contained in Section 3.2(a)
shall not apply with respect to any Exempt Transfer.

                  3.3 Transfers in Violation of Agreement. Any Transfer or
attempted Transfer of any Shares in violation of any provision of this Agreement
shall be void, and the Company shall not record such Transfer on its books or
treat any purported transferee of such Shares as the owner of such Shares for
any purpose.

                                 LIQUIDTY RIGHTS

                  4.1 Duty to Negotiate; Appraisal.

                  (a) If the Sponsors shall have cooperated with the Company in
its efforts to consummate a Qualified Public Offering but the Company has not
consummated a Qualified Public Offering prior to the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, then, at any time thereafter, Sponsors holding at least 75% of the
Sponsor Shares (the "Sponsor Group") may give notice (the "Transfer Notice") to
Parent that the Sponsor Group desires to sell their Shares to Parent. For a
period of 30 days from the date of the Transfer Notice, each party will
negotiate in good faith regarding a sale of all the Sponsor Shares to the Parent
or the Company. If the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of a sale of
the Sponsor Shares to the Parent or the Company within such

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

30-day period, then the Sponsors may elect to initiate the Appraisal Process to
determine the Appraisal Price (the "Election"). Any Appraisal Process shall be
initiated by the Sponsor Group by delivering to Parent and the Company the
report of the first appraiser.

                  (b) If, following the first Appraisal Process, the Sponsor
Group is not satisfied in its sole discretion, with the Appraisal Price (which
determination it shall make within fifteen (15) days of completion of the
Appraisal Process), then it may elect (the "Second Election") to initiate the
Appraisal Process a second time; provided that the Sponsor Group may not make a
Second Election within 12 months of the Election. If, following the second
Appraisal Process, the Sponsor Group is not satisfied in its sole discretion,
with the Appraisal Price (which determination it shall make within fifteen (15)
days of completion of the Appraisal Process), then it may elect to initiate the
Appraisal Process a third time (the "Third Election"), provided that, the
Sponsor Group may not make a Third Election within 12 months of the Second
Election. The Sponsors may not initiate the Appraisal Process more than three
times.

                  (c) If, following any Appraisal Process, the Sponsor Group is
satisfied, in its sole discretion, with the Appraisal Price, the Sponsor Group
shall so notify the Parent and the Company and the Parent or the Company may
elect, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice of the Sponsor Group's
approval of the Appraisal Price, in its sole discretion, to purchase for cash
all of the Sponsor Shares from the Sponsors at the Appraisal Price by sending
written notice to the Sponsors, and, in such event, the Sponsors shall sell all
the Sponsor Shares to the Company and/or Parent. The closing of the purchase of
the Shares from the Sponsors by the Company and/or Parent pursuant to this
Section 4.1(c) shall occur no later than 30 days after notice of the Company or
Parent's election to purchase.

                  (d) If the Sponsor Group, in its sole discretion, has approved
an Appraisal Price, but the Company and Parent elect not to purchase the
Sponsors' Shares or fail to make an election within the 15-day time period
referenced in clause (c) above, then the Sponsors shall have the right to compel
a Sale of the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(e) (the "Sale Process").

                  (e) In accordance with Section 4.1(d) above, the Sponsor Group
may elect to compel a Sale of the Company in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 4.1(e) by providing written notice thereof to the Company.

                  (i)      The Stockholders and the Company promptly after
                           receiving such notice will take, under the direction
                           of the Sponsor Group, all actions reasonably
                           necessary or desirable and will use their reasonable
                           best efforts to cause the consummation of such Sale
                           of the Company at the highest value reasonably
                           available. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each
                           of Parent and the Company shall provide the Sponsors
                           with prompt notice regarding any and all approvals,
                           consents, notifications, waivers and other legal
                           requirements applicable to it and necessary for the
                           consummation of the proposed Sale of the Company, and
                           shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
                           such approvals, consents, notifications and waivers,
                           and comply with all such other legal requirements in
                           a timely fashion, (ii) the Company shall hire an

                           otherwise facilitate a Sale of the Company, (iii) if
                           the proposed Sale of the Company is structured as a
                           sale of assets or a merger or consolidation, or

                           vote or cause to be voted all Shares that they hold
                           or with respect to which such Stockholder has the
                           power to direct the voting and which are entitled to
                           vote on such transaction in favor of such transaction
                           and will waive any appraisal rights which they may
                           have in connection therewith, and (iv) subject to the
                           provisions of 4.1(e)(iii) and to the approval of the
                           Sale of the Company by the Sponsor Group, in its sole
                           discretion, if the proposed Sale of the Company is
                           structured as or involves a sale or redemption of
                           Shares, the Stockholders will agree to sell their
                           pro-rata share of the Shares being sold in such Sale
                           of the Company on the terms and conditions approved
                           by such Sponsor Group, and the Stockholders and the
                           Company will execute any merger, asset purchase,
                           security purchase, recapitalization or other sale
                           agreement approved by such Sponsor Group (the
                           "Definitive Sale Agreements"), and will make to the
                           buyer the same representations, warranties,
                           covenants, indemnities and agreements (other than
                           non-competition agreements) as the Sponsor Group
                           makes in connection with such Sale of the Company
                           (except that in the case of representations and
                           warranties pertaining specifically to, or covenants
                           made specifically by, the Sponsor Group, the other
                           Stockholders shall make comparable representations
                           and warranties pertaining specifically to (and, as
                           applicable, covenants by) themselves), and must agree
                           to bear its ratable share (which shall be
                           proportionate based on the value of Shares that are
                           being sold in such Sale of the Company) of all
                           liabilities of the Stockholders arising out of
                           representations, warranties (other than those
                           representations, warranties and covenants that
                           pertain specifically to a given Stockholder),
                           covenants, indemnities or other agreements made in
                           the Definitive Sale Agreements.

                  (ii)     The obligations of the Stockholders with respect to
                           the Sale of the Company are subject to the
                           satisfaction of the following conditions: (A) upon
                           the consummation of the Sale of the Company, all of
                           the holders of a particular class or series of Shares
                           shall receive the same form and amount of
                           consideration per share, or amount of Shares, or if
                           any holders of a particular class or series of Shares
                           are given an option as to the form and amount of
                           consideration to be received, all holders of such
                           class or series will be given the same option, and
                           (B) all holders of vested and exercisable rights to
                           acquire a particular class or series of Shares will
                           be given an opportunity to either (1) exercise such
                           rights prior to the consummation of the Sale of the
                           Company and participate in such sale as holders of
                           such Shares or (2) upon the consummation of the Sale
                           of the Company, receive in exchange for such rights
                           consideration equal to the

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

                           amount determined by multiplying (x) the same amount
                           of consideration per share, or amount of Shares
                           received by the holders of such type and class of
                           Shares in connection with the Sale of the Company
                           less the exercise price per share, or amount of such
                           rights to acquire such Shares by (y) the number of
                           shares, or aggregate amount of Shares represented by
                           such rights.

                  (iii)    Each Stockholder will bear its or his pro-rata share
                           (based upon the relative amount of Shares sold) of
                           the reasonable and customary costs of any Sale of the
                           Company to the extent such costs are incurred for the
                           benefit of all Stockholders and are not otherwise
                           paid by the Company or the acquiring party.

                  (iv)     In no event will the auction process take more than
                           180 days (the "Auction Period"), unless Definitive
                           Sale Agreements have been entered into prior to the
                           end of the Auction Period. Unless Definitive Sale
                           Agreements have previously been executed, the Sponsor
                           Group shall have the right to terminate the Sale
                           Process at any time during the Auction Period in its
                           sole discretion (the "Sale Termination Right"). If
                           (i) the Sponsor Group exercises the Sale Termination
                           Right, or (ii) the Sale of the Company as
                           contemplated by the Definitive Sale Agreements is not
                           consummated (unless the failure to consummate is the
                           result of a breach of the Definitive Agreements by a
                           member of the Sponsor Group), then, at any time on or
                           after 6 months after the date on which the Sponsor
                           Group exercised the Sale Termination Date or the
                           Definitive Sale Agreements terminated in accordance
                           with their terms, as the case may be, the Sponsor
                           Group may, again initiate their liquidity rights
                           under this Article IV (commencing with Section
                           4.1(a)), subject to the terms of Section 4.1(b). If,
                           (i) at the end of the Auction Period, there is no
                           good faith, bona fide offer to acquire the Company,
                           or (ii) the shareholders of Parent have the right to
                           approve the Sale of the Company and vote against such
                           transaction, then , the Sponsor Group may, in its
                           sole discretion, either (i) exercise the exchange
                           rights described in Section 4.2, or (ii) again and at
                           any time initiate their liquidity rights under this
                           Article IV (commencing with Section 4.1(a)), subject
                           to the terms of Section 4.1(b).

                  4.2      Exchange Rights.

         If a Sale of the Company does not occur in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.1(c), then the Sponsor Group may elect to exchange all,
but not less than all, of the Sponsor Shares for shares of common stock of
Parent based upon the Appraisal Price of the Sponsor shares pursuant to a new
Appraisal Process initiated at the time the Sponsor Group elects to exercise
their exchange rights hereunder and the fair market value of the Parent's common
stock determined by the average closing price of the Parent's common stock for
the 45-day trading period immediately prior to the date of the exchange for
Parent common stock (the "Exchange"). To the extent the number of shares to be
received by Purchasers at the Appraisal Price constitutes

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

more than 19.9% of the outstanding capital stock of Parent (as determined
pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), then Purchasers will
receive the balance in cash as a pro rata portion of the Appraisal Price. Upon
written notice to Parent and the Company of the Sponsor Group's election to
consummate such Exchange (the "Exchange Notice"), each of Parent and the Company
shall (i) provide the Sponsors with prompt notice regarding any and all
approvals, consents, notifications, waivers, filings, amendments and other legal
requirements applicable to it and necessary for the consummation of the proposed
Exchange, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all such
approvals, consents, notifications, waivers, filings and amendments and shall
comply with all such other legal requirements in a timely fashion, and (ii) take
all other actions reasonably necessary or desirable and use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the consummation of the Exchange.

                                   ARTICLE V
                                REDEMPTION RIGHTS

                  5.1 Redemption of Sponsor Shares. At any time prior to a
Public Offering becoming effective:

                  (a) Parent shall provide the Sponsors with no less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice of any event that will constitute a Parent Change
of Control. If the Sponsor Group gives notice of its election (such election to
be called the "Redemption Notice") within twenty (20) days after receipt of such
notice from the Parent, to have the Company redeem its Shares, then, upon
consummation of such Parent Change of Control (the "Redemption Date"), the
Company shall be required to redeem, at the Redemption Price (as defined below),
all of the Shares then held by the Sponsors (the "Redemption Shares"). The
Redemption Notice must request redemption of all, and not less than all, of the
Shares held by the Sponsors.

                  (b) For purposes of this provision, a "Parent Change of
Control" shall be deemed to have occurred when there has occurred (i) an
acquisition by any "person" (as that term is used in Sections 13(d)(3) and
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (or any
successor item, regulation or act to the same effect)) of beneficial ownership,
directly or indirectly, of securities of Parent representing more than fifty
percent (50%) of the combined voting power of Parent's then outstanding
securities; (ii) an acquisition by any "person" (as that term is used in
Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") (or any successor item, regulation or act to the same effect))
of the right to appoint a majority of Parent's board of directors; or (iii) the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent.

                  (c) The redemption price for each Redemption Share (the
"Redemption Price") shall be the Appraisal Price of each share of the Company's
Common Stock on the date that the applicable Redemption Notice is first given
under Section 5.1 (the "Determination Date").

                  (d) In consideration of the redemption of the Redemption
Shares hereunder, the Company shall deliver to the Sponsors on the Redemption
Date, the Redemption Price, in cash by certified check or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

<PAGE>

                  5.2 Redemption Closing. The closing of the redemption of the
Redemption Shares being redeemed by the Sponsors (the "Redemption Closing")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 100
Federal Street, Boston, MA 02110 on the applicable Redemption Date, or at such
other time and place as the Sponsors and the Company may agree. The Sponsors
shall deliver to the Company at the Closing a certificate or certificates
evidencing the Shares redeemed hereunder together with executed stock powers.

                  5.3 Failure to Redeem. If the Company fails to redeem all of
the Redemption Shares on the Redemption Date, then the Company shall be deemed
to have breached Section 5.1 hereof. If the Company's breach is due to
insufficient funds, then those funds which are available to the Company will be
used to redeem, pro rata, based on the aggregate Redemption Price, the maximum
possible number of Redemption Shares. In the event of such a breach, in addition
to any other remedies available to the Sponsors at law or in equity, between the
Redemption Date and such time as the redemption is completed, the Redemption
Price shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum,
compounded annually; provided that such rate shall increase by 2% on the date
that is six (6) months after the Redemption Date, and subject to applicable law,
shall further increase by an additional 2% on the last day of every quarter
thereafter, until such Redemption Shares are fully redeemed. If the Company
redeems fewer than all of the Redemption Shares offered for redemption, the
holders of the Shares not redeemed shall continue to receive the benefit of the
rights and privileges afforded the Shares hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                               PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

                  6.1      Issuance of New Shares.

                                    i. Purchase Rights. If at any time after the
                           date of this Agreement the Company proposes to issue
                           or sell any Common Stock, Common Stock Equivalents or
                           securities convertible into equity securities of the
                           Company (collectively, "New Shares"), the Company
                           shall first offer to sell to each Stockholder a
                           portion of each type of such New Shares equal to the
                           quotient determined by dividing (x) the number of
                           Shares held, beneficially owned by such Stockholder,
                           by (y) the total number of Shares outstanding
                           immediately prior to such issuance or sale. A
                           Stockholder shall be entitled to purchase all or any
                           portion of their respective portions (as determined
                           in the immediately preceding sentence) of such New
                           Shares at the most favorable price and on the most
                           favorable terms as such New Shares are to be offered.
                           The holders of Shares shall further have a right of
                           over-allotment such that to the extent a Stockholder
                           (a "Rejecting Holder") does not does not exercise its
                           right to purchase any of the New Shares, or exercises
                           its rights for less than all of its pro rata share of
                           the New Shares (as determined above), then each other
                           Stockholder may elect to purchase its pro rata share
                           (as determined above) of such New Shares which the
                           Rejecting Holder does not elect to purchase.

                                    ii. Offer Period. In order to exercise its
                           purchase rights hereunder, each Stockholder must,
                           within 30 days after receipt of written notice from
                           the Company describing in reasonable detail the New
                           Shares being offered, the purchase price thereof, the
                           payment terms, the percentage of the New Shares
                           initially available to such holder pursuant to
                           Section 5.1(a) and the over-allotment right available
                           in connection therewith, deliver a written notice to
                           the Company describing its election to exercise its
                           purchase rights hereunder.

                                    iii. Expiration of Offer Period. Upon the
                           expiration of the offering periods described above,
                           the Company shall be entitled to sell such New Shares
                           which the Stockholders have not elected to purchase
                           during the 180 days following such expiration on
                           terms and conditions no more favorable to the
                           purchasers thereof than those offered to the
                           Stockholders of Stock. Any New Shares to be sold by
                           the Company after such 180-day period must be
                           reoffered to the Stockholders pursuant to the terms
                           of this Section 6.1.

                                    iv. Exceptions to Purchase Rights. The
                           provisions of this Section 6.1 will not apply to the
                           following issuances of New Shares:

                       2.    Equity Securities issued in respect of or in

                           split or similar transaction, and

                       3.    Equity Securities issued in the first Public
                           Offering approved by the Board in accordance with the

                                  ARTICLE VII
                           BOARD OBSERVERS AND ACCESS

                  7.1 Board Representation and Access. The Company agrees that,
at any time prior to a Public Offering, in the event that any Sponsor loses its
right to designate all of its directors pursuant to Section 2.1(b):

                  (a) such Sponsor (an "Affected Sponsor") shall have the right
to designate an employee of such Sponsor or its Affiliates as a non-voting

                  (b) The Non-Voting Observer shall be entitled to be present at
all meetings of the Board and of each committee of the Board and such observer
shall be notified of any meeting of the Board or committee, including such
meeting's time and place, in the same manner as Board members and shall have the
same access to information (including any copies of all materials distributed to
members of the Board or a committee thereof) concerning the business and
operations of the Company and at the same time as Board members and shall be
entitled to participate in discussions and consult with, and make proposals and
furnish advice to, the Board or committee without voting; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be under any obligation to take any action with
respect to any proposals made or advice furnished by the Non-Voting Observer,
and nothing herein shall prevent the Board (or any committee thereof) from
acting by written instrument to the extent permitted by applicable law. The
Non-Voting Observer shall have a duty of confidentiality to the Company
comparable to the duty of confidentiality of a director of the Company.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an issue is to be
discussed or otherwise arises at any meeting of the Board or any committee of
the Board which, in the reasonable judgment of the Board or a majority of the
members of such committee, based on advice of legal counsel, cannot be discussed
in the presence of the Non-Voting Observer in order to avoid a conflict of
interest on the part of the Non-Voting Observer or to preserve an
attorney-client or accountant-client or any other available privilege, then such
issue may be discussed without the Non-Voting Observer being present and may be
deleted from any materials being distributed in connection with any meeting at
which such issues are to be discussed, so long as the Non-Voting Observer is
given notice of the occurrence of such meeting and the deletion of such
materials.

                  (d) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, upon
reasonable notice at reasonable times from time to time, at the sole expense of
the Affected Sponsor, provide the Affected Sponsor (and any other parent company
of the Affected Sponsor that is a venture capital operating company) reasonable
opportunities to routinely consult with and advise the management of the Company
and its subsidiaries on all matters relating to the operation of the Company and
each such Subsidiary. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to
give, subject to compliance with applicable laws and confidentiality obligations
to third parties, the Affected Sponsor (and any other parent company of the
Affected Sponsor that is a venture capital operating company) and their
authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all
books of account, facilities and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries
and permit the Affected Sponsor (and any parent company of the Affected Sponsor
that is a venture capital operating company) to make such copies and inspections
thereof as any such Person may reasonably request and discuss the affairs,
finances and accounts with the officers thereof; provided that the Affected
Sponsor shall not exercise such rights more often than two times during any
calendar year, and such additional times as may be reasonably required in order
to qualify any of the Shares as a venture capital investment (as defined in the
Department of Labor Regulation Sction. 2510.3-101). Any such visit will be at
the expense of the Affected Sponsor (or such other parent company of the
Affected Sponsor that is a venture capital operating company).

                  (e) If (i) reasonably required, in order to qualify any of the
Shares as a venture capital investment (as defined in the Department of Labor
Regulation Section 2510.3-101) or (ii) the

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

Affected Sponsor is unable for any reason to appoint a Non-Voting Observer to
the Board (and each of the committees, except the compensation committee,
thereof), then the Company shall promptly provide true and correct copies of all
documents, reports, financial data, and such additional financial and other
information with respect to the Company, and its subsidiaries as the Affected
Sponsor (and any other parent company of the Affected Sponsor that is a venture
capital operating company) may from time to time reasonably request.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  9.1 Certain Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth or as referenced below:

                  "Affiliate" of any particular Person means any other Person
Controlling, Controlled by or under common Control with such particular Person
or, in the case of a natural Person, any other member of such Person's Family
Group.

                  "Agreement" has the meaning set forth in the preamble.

                  "Appraisal Price" means the "fair market value" of each Share
determined in accordance with this definition by one or more of the following
independent investment banking firms (the "Firms") acting as an appraiser (an
"Appraiser"): Bank of America Securities, LLC, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley,
provided that if all such Firms have been exhausted by either having already
rendered a valuation or the Sponsor Group or Parent has approached such Firms to
engage them and such Firms have declined such engagement, then the parties will
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree upon another
independent, nationally recognized investment banking firm. Each party who
selects an Appraiser must make such selection within fifteen (15) days of the
event triggering the Appraisal. Each party selecting an Appraiser hereunder
shall direct the Appraiser to deliver its valuation within thirty (30) days of
being retained, and such party shall cooperate with the Appraiser and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such valuation to be delivered within such time
frame. The expenses of any Appraiser engaged in connection with the Appraisal
Process shall be divided evenly among the parties. The Appraisal Price shall be
determined as follows:

                  (a)      Each Appraiser retained hereunder shall determine the
                           fair market per share value of the Sponsor Shares
                           assuming the sale of the entire equity interest of

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

                           the Company to an independent willing buyer in an
                           arms'-length transaction under then current
                           prevailing market conditions for the sale of all of
                           the stock of comparable business enterprises intended
                           for continued use as part of a going concern. Each
                           Appraiser shall assume that in any such transaction
                           each shareholder of the Company would receive the
                           same per share consideration, and the Appraiser shall
                           not apply any discount for minority interest or
                           illiquidity of the Sponsor Shares, nor any control
                           premium.

                  (b)      The initial Appraiser shall be selected by the
                           Sponsor Group (the "Sponsor Appraiser"). If the
                           Parent does not accept the per share valuation
                           arrived at by the Sponsor Appraiser, then the Parent
                           shall promptly notify THL and TPG thereof and Parent
                           shall retain one of the Firms as a second Appraiser
                           (the "Parent Appraiser").

                  (c)      If a valuation is delivered by the Parent Appraiser
                           in accordance with paragraph (b), and the Parent
                           Appraiser and the Sponsor Appraiser arrive at per
                           share valuations (the "Initial Valuations") within
                           ten percent (10%) of each other, the mathematical
                           mean of the Initial Valuations shall be deemed to be
                           the Appraisal Price. If such Appraisers shall arrive
                           at Initial Valuations that are not within ten percent
                           (10%) of each other but are within twenty percent
                           (20%) of each other, then the Parent Appraiser and
                           the Sponsor Appraiser, as soon as reasonably
                           practicable, shall jointly retain a Firm to act as a
                           third Appraiser (the "Third Appraiser") on reasonable
                           terms agreed to by the Sponsor Group and Parent in
                           good faith. In the event the valuation of the Third
                           Appraiser is greater than the higher of the Initial
                           Valuations, then the Appraisal Price shall be the
                           higher of the Initial Valuations. In the event the
                           valuation of the Third Appraiser is less than the
                           lower of the Initial Valuations, the Appraisal Price
                           shall be the lower of the Initial Valuations. If the
                           valuation of the Third Appraiser is not greater than
                           the higher of the Initial Valuations or lower than
                           the lower of the Initial Valuations, the Appraisal
                           Price shall be the mathematical mean of (i) the per
                           share valuation arrived at by the Third Appraiser,
                           and (ii) the Initial Valuation that is closest to
                           that of the per share valuation arrived at by the
                           Third Appraiser.

                  (d)      If the Initial Valuations are not within twenty
                           percent (20%) of each other, then neither valuation
                           shall be used and the Sponsor Group will retain a new
                           Firm to act as Sponsor Appraiser (the "Second Sponsor
                           Appraiser") and Parent shall retain a new Firm to act
                           as Parent Appraiser (the "Second Parent Appraiser").
                           If the per share valuations arrived at by the Second
                           Sponsor Appraiser and Second Parent Appraiser (the
                           "Second Valuations") are within twenty percent (20%)
                           of each other, then the Appraisal Price shall be
                           determined as set forth in paragraph (c) above. If
                           the Second Valuations are not within twenty percent
                           (20%) of each other, then the Second Valuations shall
                           not be used and the Second Parent Appraiser and the
                           Second Sponsor Appraiser, as soon as reasonably
                           practicable, shall jointly select a Firm to act as a
                           final Appraiser (the "Final Appraiser") on reasonable
                           terms agreed to by

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

                           the Sponsor Group and Parent in good faith. So long
                           as the valuation of the Final Appraiser is not higher
                           than the higher of the Second Valuations or lower
                           than the lower of the Second Valuations, the
                           valuation arrived at by the Final Appraiser shall be
                           deemed to be the Appraisal Price. In the event the
                           valuation of the Final Appraiser is greater than the
                           higher of the Second Valuations, then the Appraisal
                           Price shall be the higher of the Second Valuations.
                           In the event the valuation of the Final Appraiser is
                           less than the lower of the Second Valuations, the
                           Appraisal Price shall be the lower of the Second
                           Valuations.

illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect

illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

herein, this document embodies the complete agreement and understanding among
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and

counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages) each of which
shall be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and

entitled to enforce their rights under this Agreement specifically, to recover
damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement (including

of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or
injunctive relief (without posting a bond or other security) in order to enforce

            WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition
precedent to the Purchasers' closing the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein made, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Non-Competition.

      (a) For a period (the "Term") commencing on the date hereof and continuing
until the first anniversary of the date (the "Separation Date") Parent ceases to
beneficially own at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company, Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (other
than the Company or its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, own,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation
or control, other than their ownership and control of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership
form or otherwise, engaged in a Competitive Business (defined below).

      (b) For purposes hereof, "Competitive Business" shall mean:

            (i)   providing (A) retail bank core processing systems, (B)
                  customer channel-solutions (online-retail and commercial, ATM,
                  branch, teller and call center), (C) consumer lending and
                  servicing systems,

                  mortgage loan origination and servicing systems, and (E) data
                  center outsourcing services to credit unions, community banks,
                  thrifts, data centers, banks and other financial institutions;
                  and

            (ii)  providing real estate tax, credit, flood, default and

                  to financial institutions and loan servicers

      (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent Parent from:

            (i)   Engaging in any of the activities set forth on Schedule 1
                  hereto ("Permitted Competitive Business Activity");

            (ii)  Acquiring control of a business which is engaged in a
                  Competitive Business (an "Acquisition") and continuing to
                  conduct such Competitive Business if, and only if, Parent
                  presents the opportunity to make the Investment to the Board
                  of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and (A) Parent's
                  designees on the Board have voted in favor of the Company or
                  one of its Subsidiaries making such Investment, and (B) the
                  Purchasers' designees on the Board have voted against the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries making such Investment;
                  provided that, Parent has consummated the Investment on the
                  same terms presented to the Board. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, nothing contained in this clause (c)(ii) shall
                  permit Parent to conduct any activities that constitute a
                  Competitive Business through such acquired entity if such type
                  of activities were not conducted by the acquired entity at the
                  time of the Acquisition;

            (iii) Acquiring control of a business (A) which earns less than 10%

                  Minor Competitive Activity shall comprise less than 10% of the
                  annual revenues of the acquired business during the entire
                  Term hereof, or (B) which earns more than 10%, but less than
                  50% of its annual revenues from engaging in a Competitive
                  Business ("Divestible Competitive Activity"); provided,
                  however that such Divestible Competitive Activity shall be
                  offered to the Company within thirty (30) days after closing
                  such acquisition at a price equal to that paid by the Parent
                  or, if such price was not separately determined, at fair
                  market value as determined by mutual consent of the parties or
                  a mutually agreed upon appraisal process; or

                                       2

                  and is engaged in a Competitive Business.

2. Severability. Each provision herein shall be treated as a separate and
independent clause, and the unenforceability of any one clause shall in no way
impair the enforceability of any other clauses of the Agreement. If one or more
of the provisions contained herein shall for any reason be held to be
excessively broad in scope, activity, subject or otherwise so as to be
unenforceable at law, such provision(s) shall be construed by the appropriate
judicial body by limiting or reducing it (or them) so as to be enforceable to
the maximum extent under the applicable law.

3. Amendments; Waiver. Any amendment to or modification of this Agreement, or
any waiver of any provision hereof, shall be in writing and signed by the
Company and Parent, and shall be approved by the Purchasers. Any waiver by the
Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or any other
provision hereof.

4. Assignment; Successors. The Company shall have the right to assign this
Agreement to its successors and assigns. All covenants and agreements hereunder
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

5. Equitable Relief. Parent agrees that a breach of this Agreement will result
in irreparable harm to the Company and that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and that the Company shall
be entitled, in addition to all other remedies available to it, to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, without the
necessity of posting a bond or other security as a result of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

6. Governing Law; Forum Selection Clause. This Agreement and any claims arising
out of this Agreement (or any other claims arising out of the relationship
between the parties) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be interpreted, enforced
and governed under the internal and domestic laws of such state, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state. Any claims or legal
actions by one party against the other may be commenced and maintained in any
state or federal court located in such state, and the parties hereby submit to
the jurisdiction and venue of any such court.

7. Enforcement. The Purchasers shall have the right to enforce the provisions of

Holders") and specifies the number of Registrable Shares to be included in such

<PAGE>

            (c) Effecting the Registration. Subject to the restrictions set
forth in Section 2.1(f), the Company will give prompt written notice of any such
Registration Request (the "Registration Notice") to all other holders of
Registrable Shares and will thereupon use its reasonable best efforts to effect
the registration (a "Demand Registration") under the Securities Act on any form
available to the Company of:

            (i)   in the case of a Company Qualified Public Offering, the
                  Registrable Shares required to be registered by the Company;

            (ii)  the Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the
                  Requesting Holders; and

            (iii) all other Registrable Shares of the same type and class which
                  the Company has received a written request to register
                  pursuant to Section 2.2(a) within 20 days after the
                  Registration Notice is given and any securities of the Company
                  proposed to be included in such registration by the Company
                  for its own account (provided such securities shall be of the
                  same class required to be registered under Section 2.1(a)).

            (d) Preservation of Demand Registration. A registration undertaken
by the Company at the request of the Requesting Holder under Section 2.1(a) will
not count as a Demand Registration:

            (i)   if, pursuant to the Demand Right, the Requesting Holders are
                  unable to register and sell at least 50% of the Registrable
                  Shares requested to be included in such registration by them,
                  unless such failure results from any act of, or failure to act
                  by, any of the Requesting Holders;

            (ii)  if the Requesting Holders withdraw their Registration Request
                  prior to the time the Registration Statement therefor is
                  declared effective and promptly reimburse the Company for all
                  Registration Expenses incurred by the Company in connection
                  with effecting such registration, such Registration Request
                  shall not count as a Demand Registration) so long as this
                  provision has not been previously utilized by the Sponsors
                  within the immediately preceding 18 months; or

            (iii) if the Requesting Holders withdraw a Registration Request upon
                  the determination of the board of directors of the Company to
                  postpone the filing or effectiveness of a Registration
                  Statement pursuant to Section 2.1(f).

            (e) Priority on Demand Registration. If the sole or managing
underwriter of a Demand Registration advises the Company in writing that in its

                                       5
<PAGE>

reasonable opinion the number of Registrable Shares and other securities
requested to be included exceeds the number of Registrable Shares and other
securities which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
distribution of the securities being offered, the price that will be paid in
such offering or the marketability thereof, the Company will include in such
registration the Registrable Shares in the following priority:

            (i)   first, in the event of a Company-Qualified Public Offering,
                  the greatest number of securities of the Company proposed to
                  be included in such registration by the Company for its own
                  account, which in the opinion of such underwriters can be so
                  sold; and

            (ii)  second, after all securities that the Company proposes to
                  register for its own account have been included, the greatest
                  amount of Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the
                  holders thereof which in the opinion of such underwriters can
                  be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
                  distribution of the securities being offered, the price that
                  will be paid in such offering or the marketability thereof,
                  ratably among the holders of Registrable Shares (whether
                  requested to be registered pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2)
                  based on the respective amounts of Registrable Shares
                  requested to be included and held by each such holder.

            (f) Restrictions on Demand Registrations. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 2.1(f), following the Company's initial Public
Offering, the Company shall not be obligated to effect (i) more than two (2)
Demand Registrations pursuant to a Demand Right exercised by the THL Holders
under Section 2.1(a), and (ii) more than two (2) Demand Registrations pursuant
to a Demand Right exercised by the TPG Holders under Section 2.1(a). No
Securityholder may exercise a Demand Right under this Section 2.1 unless the
reasonably anticipated gross proceeds of the resulting offering would exceed
$75,000,000. Any Demand Registration requested must be for a firmly underwritten
public offering of Registrable Shares to be managed by an underwriter or
underwriters of recognized national standing selected by the Company and
reasonably acceptable to the Requesting Holders. The Company may defer the
filing (but not the preparation thereof) of a Registration Statement to effect a
Demand Registration if, after a request is made, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with independent
outside counsel, that the filing of a Registration Statement would require
disclosure in the Registration Statement of material, non-public information in
order to make the statements in the Registration Statement not misleading which
the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential, and
disclosure of which would have an adverse effect on the Company or its business.
The Company may defer the registration under this paragraph (d) pursuant to the
preceding sentence until the earlier of (A) the date upon which such material
information is disclosed to the public or disclosure of which would no longer be
material or materially detrimental or (B) 90 days after the Company first makes
such good faith determination;

                                       6
<PAGE>

provided, however, that the Company shall not utilize this right to defer more
than once in any twelve-month period.

            (g) Stock Splits. In connection with any Demand Registration
pursuant to this Section 2.1, each party to this Agreement will vote, or cause
to be voted, all securities of the Company over which it has the power to vote
or direct the voting to effect any stock split which, in the opinion of the sole
or managing underwriter, is necessary to facilitate the effectiveness of such
Demand Registration.

            (h) Other Registration Rights. Except as provided in this Agreement,
the Company shall not grant to any Persons the right to request the Company to
register any equity securities of the Company or any incidental or "piggy-back"
rights that are superior or pari pasu with respect to any equity security of the
Company, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
such securities, without the prior written consent of the Sponsor Group.

            2.2 Incidental Registration.

            (a) Requests for Incidental Registration. At any time the Company
proposes to register for a Public Offering any shares of Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act, including registrations pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and
2.1(b), whether or not for sale for its own account, the Company will give
written notice to each holder of Registrable Shares at least 20 days prior to
the initial filing of such Registration Statement with the SEC of its intent to
file such Registration Statement and of such holder's rights under this Section
2.2. Upon the written request of any holder of Registrable Shares made within 10
days after any such notice is given (which request shall specify the Registrable
Shares intended to be disposed of by such holder), the Company will effect the
registration (an "Incidental Registration") under the Securities Act of all
Registrable Shares which the Company has been so requested to register by the
holders thereof; provided, however, that if, at any time after giving written
notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such Incidental
Registration (each an "Incidental Registration Statement"), (i) the Company
shall determine not to register such securities for its own account (provided
such Company-initiated registration is not pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof) or
to defer the registration of such securities in accordance with Section 2.1(f),
or (ii) the Securityholder exercising a Demand Right shall determine for any
reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company
or such Securityholder, as the case may be, at its election, may give written
notice of such determination to each holder of Registrable Shares and,
thereupon, (a) in the case of a determination not to register, the Company shall
be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Shares under this
Section 2.2 or under Section 2.1 in connection with such particular registration
(but not from its obligation to pay the expenses incurred in connection
therewith) and (b) in the case of a determination to delay registration, the
Company shall be permitted to delay registering any Registrable Shares under
this Section 2.2 or under Section 2.1 during the period that the registration of
such other securities is delayed.

                                       7
<PAGE>

            (b) Priority on Incidental Registration. If the sole or managing
underwriter of a registration advises the Company in writing that in its opinion
the number of Registrable Shares and other securities requested to be included
exceeds the number of Registrable Shares and other securities which can be sold
in such offering without adversely affecting the distribution of the securities
being offered, the price that will be paid in such offering or the marketability
thereof, the Company will include in such registration the Registrable Shares
and other securities of the Company in the following order of priority:

            (i)   first, in the event of a Company-initiated registration, the
                  greatest number of securities of the Company proposed to be
                  included in such registration by the Company for its own
                  account, which in the opinion of such underwriters can be so
                  sold; and

            (ii)  second, after all securities that the Company proposes to
                  register for its own account have been included, the greatest
                  amount of Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the
                  holders thereof which in the opinion of such underwriters can
                  be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
                  distribution of the securities being offered, the price that
                  will be paid in such offering or the marketability thereof,
                  ratably among the holders of Registrable Shares (whether
                  requested to be registered pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2)
                  based on the respective amounts of Registrable Shares
                  requested to be included and held by each such holder.

            2.3 Registration on Form S-3

            (a) Request for Registration. After twelve (12) months following the
initial Public Offering of the Company's securities pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act, if FNF or
either of the Sponsors request that the Company file a registration statement on
Form S-3 (or any successor form to Form S-3), or any similar short-form
registration statement, for a Public Offering of Registrable Securities, the
reasonably anticipated gross proceeds from the sale of such Registrable
Securities would exceed $25,000,000, and the Company is a registrant entitled to
use Form S-3 to register the Registrable Securities for such an offering, the
Company shall (i) within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Company of such
notice, give written notice of such proposed registration to all other
Securityholders and (ii) as soon as practicable, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be registered on such
form for the offering and to cause such Registrable Securities to be qualified
in such jurisdictions as the Securityholders may reasonably request together
with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities of any Securityholders
joining in such request as are specified in a written request received by the
Company within twenty (20) days after receipt of such written notice from the
Company. After the Company's first Public Offering, the Company will use its
best efforts to qualify for and remain eligible to use Form S-3 registration or
a similar short-

                                       8
<PAGE>

form registration. For the avoidance of doubt, a registration under this Section
2.3(a) shall not be considered to be a Demand Registration for any purpose.

            (b) Deferral of Filing. The Company may defer the filing (but not
the preparation thereof) of a Registration Statement required by Section 2.3 if,
after a request is made, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in
good faith after consultation with independent outside counsel, that the filing
of a Registration Statement would require disclosure in the Registration
Statement of material, non-public information in order to make the statements in
the Registration Statement not misleading which the Company has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential, and disclosure of which would
have an adverse effect on the Company or its business. The Company may defer the
registration under this paragraph (b) pursuant to the preceding sentence until
the earlier of (A) the date upon which such material information is disclosed to
the public or disclosure would no longer be material or materially detrimental
or (B) 90 days after the Company first makes such good faith determination;
provided, however, that the Company shall not utilize this right to defer more
than once in any twelve-month period.

            2.4 Holdback Agreements. Each Securityholder agrees that if
requested in connection with any Public Offering made pursuant to this Agreement
for which a Securityholder has registration rights pursuant to this Article 2 by
the managing underwriter or underwriters of such underwritten offering, such
Securityholder will enter into an agreement with the underwriters on customary
terms regarding restrictions on the ability of the Securityholders, without the
prior written consent of the managing underwriter, to sell their Registrable
Shares during the period commencing on the date of the final prospectus to such
Public Offering and ending on the date specified by the Company and the managing
underwriter; provided, that (i) the date so specified will be no later than (A)
180 days after the date of such final prospectus in the case of an initial
Public Offering, and (B) 90 days after the date of such final prospectus for any
subsequent Public Offering, and will be the same for all Securityholders that
enter into such agreements, and (ii) all executive officers, beneficial owners
of more than 5% of the Company's capital stock and directors enter into such
agreements. In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, the Company may impose
stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Registrable Shares of each
Securityholder (and the shares or securities of every other person subject to
the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period.

            2.5 Registration Procedures. In connection with the registration of
any Registrable Shares, the Company shall effect such registrations to permit
the sale of such Registrable Shares in accordance with the intended method or
methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as
expeditiously as possible:

            (a) Prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement or
Registration Statements on a form available for the sale of the Registrable
Shares by the holders thereof in accordance with the intended method of
distribution thereof, and cause each such Registration Statement to become
effective;

                                       9
<PAGE>

            (b) (i) Except in the case of a Shelf Registration, prepare and file
with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Registration
Statement as may be reasonably requested by either Sponsor (if such Sponsor is
registering securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) or necessary to
keep such Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending on
the earlier of (A) 90 days from the effective date and (B) such time as all of
such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof; cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any
required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to
Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act; and
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to it with respect
to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement as
so amended or in such prospectus as so supplemented; and (ii) in the case of a
Shelf Registration, prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the Prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep such Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Shares subject thereto for a period ending on the
earlier of the date on which all the Registrable Shares subject thereto have
been sold pursuant to such Registration Statement or two (2) years after
effectiveness of the S-3.

            (c) Notify the Selling Securityholders of Registrable Shares
promptly (but in any event within 2 business days), and confirm such notice in
writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any
written comments by the SEC in respect of the Registration Statement or any
request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority for
amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or for additional
information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or
suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation or threat of
any proceedings for such purpose, (iv) if at any time when a prospectus is
required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of
Registrable Shares the Company becomes aware that the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting
agreement) contemplated by Section 2.5(h) below cease to be true and correct in
all material respects, (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of a Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Shares for
offer or sale in any jurisdiction, (vi) if the Company becomes aware of the
happening of any event that makes any statement of a material fact made in such
Registration Statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue or that requires the
making of any changes in such Registration Statement, prospectus or documents so
that, in the case of such Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,

                                       10
<PAGE>

and that in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (vii) if for any
other reason it shall be necessary to amend or supplement such Registration
Statement in order to comply with the Securities Act.

            (d) Use every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order
preventing or suspending the use of a prospectus or suspending the qualification
(or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Shares for sale in
any jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of
any such order at the earliest possible moment.

            (e) Promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment to the applicable Registration Statement such
information as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the holders
of a majority of the Registrable Shares of the class being sold agree should be
included therein relating to the plan of distribution with respect to such
Registrable Shares; and make all required filings of such prospectus supplement
or post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after being
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment;

            (f) Deliver to each Selling Securityholder of Registrable Shares and
the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the prospectus or
prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each amendment or
supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request; and the Company
hereby consents to the use of such prospectus and each amendment or supplement
thereto by each of the Selling Securityholders of Registrable Shares and the
underwriters or agents, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Shares covered by such prospectus and any amendment or supplement
thereto.

            (g) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Shares, to use its
best efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate with the Selling
Securityholders of Registrable Shares, the underwriters, if any, the sales
agents and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or
qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such
Registrable Shares for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of
such jurisdictions within the United States as any Selling Securityholder or the
managing underwriters reasonably request in writing; provided, however, that the
Company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (ii) take any action that
would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it
is not then so subject.

            (h) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
2.5(c)(vi) above, as promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
therein by

                                       11
<PAGE>

reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered
to the purchasers of the Registrable Shares being sold thereunder, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

            (i) Enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and
substance as is customary in underwritten offerings and take all such other
actions as are reasonably requested by the managing or sole underwriter in order
to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of such
Registrable Shares, including obtaining for delivery to the Company and the
underwriter or underwriters, if any, with copies to the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such registration, a cold comfort letter from the
Company's independent certified public accountants in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by cold comfort letters as
the managing underwriter or underwriters reasonably request, dated the date of
execution of the underwriting agreement and brought down to the closing under
the underwriting agreement.

            (j) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and
make generally available to its Securityholders earnings statements satisfying
the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder
(or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days
after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month
period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal
quarter in which Registrable Shares are sold to underwriters in a firm
commitment or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to
underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of the first
fiscal quarter of the Company after the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods.

            (k) (i) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such
Registrable Shares covered by such registration statement to be listed on the
principal securities exchange on which Common Stock is then listed (if any), if
the listing of such Registrable Shares is then permitted under the rules of such
exchange, or (ii) if no Common Stock is then so listed, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, either (as the Company may elect) (x) cause all such
Registrable Shares to be listed on a national securities exchange or (y) secure
designation of all such Registrable Shares as a NASDAQ "national market system
security" within the meaning of Rule 11Aa2-1 or, failing that, to secure NASDAQ
authorization for such shares and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to register as such with
respect to such shares with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
("NASD").

            (l) Make available upon reasonable notice at reasonable times and
for reasonable periods for inspection by a representative appointed by the
holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares of each class covered by the
applicable Registration Statement, by any managing underwriter or underwriters
participating in any disposition

                                       12
<PAGE>

to be effected pursuant to such Registration Statement and by any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by such sellers or any such managing
underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company, and cause all of the Company's
officers, directors and employees and the independent public accountants who
have certified its financial statements to make themselves available to discuss
the business of the Company and to supply all information reasonably requested
by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection
with such Registration Statement as shall be necessary to enable them to
exercise their due diligence responsibility (subject to the entry by each party
referred to in this clause (l) into customary confidentiality agreements in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company).

            (m) In the case of an underwritten offering, cause the senior
executive officers of the Company to participate in the customary "road show"
presentations that may be reasonably requested by the managing underwriter in
any such underwritten offering and otherwise to facilitate, cooperate with, and
participate in each proposed offering contemplated herein and customary selling
efforts related thereto; provided however this right may not be exercised
pursuant to a registration in which the Company is not selling securities more
than once in any 12 month period without the consent of such senior executive
officers.

                  The Company may require each holder of Registrable Shares as
to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company such
information regarding such holder and the distribution of such Registrable
Shares as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably request in writing;
provided that, such information shall be used only in connection with such
registration. The Company may exclude from such registration the Registrable
Shares of any holder who unreasonably fails to furnish such information promptly
after receiving such request. Each holder agrees that, upon receipt of any
notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 2.5(c)(ii), 2.5(c)(iv) or 2.5 (c)(v), such holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Shares covered by such Registration
Statement or prospectus until such holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 2.5, or until it is
advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable prospectus may
be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto.

                  In the case of a Shelf Registration, each holder of
Registrable Shares, upon receipt of any notice (a "Suspension Notice") from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.5(c) or
any circumstance described in Section 2.1(f) or 2.3(b), shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of the Registrable Shares pursuant to the Shelf
Registration covering such Registrable Shares until (i) with respect to an event
in Section 2.5(c), such holder's receipt of the copies of the writing (the
"Advice") by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated
by reference in the prospectus, and (ii) with respect to a circumstance

                                       13
<PAGE>

described in Section 2.1(f) or 2.3(b), 90 days after receipt of the Suspension
Notice. The Company shall not give a Suspension Notice until after the Shelf
Registration has been declared effective and shall not give more than one
Suspension Registration has been declared effective and shall not give more than
one Suspension Notice during any period of twelve consecutive months and in no
event shall the period from the date on which any holder receives a Suspension
Notice to the date on which any holder receives either the Advice or copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 2.5(c) (the
"Suspension Period") exceed 90 days. In the event that the Company shall give
any Suspension Notice, the Company shall use its best efforts and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary to render the Advice and end the Suspension
Period as promptly as practicable.

            2.6 Registration Expenses. Subject to Section 2.1(d)(i), all of the
following fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with
this Agreement by the Company shall be borne by the Company, whether or not any
Registration Statement is filed or becomes effective, (i) all registration and
filing fees (including, without limitation, (A) fees with respect to filings
required to be made with the NASD in connection with an underwritten offering
and (B) fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or "blue sky"
laws), (ii) reasonable messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, (iii) fees
and disbursements of counsel for the Company, (iv) fees and disbursements of all
independent certified public accountants referred to in Section 2.5(h), (v)
underwriters' fees and expenses (excluding discounts, commissions, or fees of
underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers or similar securities industry
professionals relating to the distribution of the Registrable Shares), (vi)
Securities Act liability insurance, if the Company so desires such insurance,
(vii) internal expenses of the Company, (viii) the expense of any annual audit,
(ix) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the
securities to be registered on any securities exchange, (x) the fees and
expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company, and
(xi) shall reimburse the holders of the Registrable Shares being registered in
such registration for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one
counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) chosen by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Registrable Shares held by the Requesting Holders
and reasonably acceptable to the Company.

            2.7 Indemnification; Contribution.

            (a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall, without
limitation as to time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted
by law, each holder of Registrable Shares, the officers, directors, agents,
partners and employees of each of them, each Person who controls each such
holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act), the officers, directors, agents, partners and employees of
each such controlling person and any financial or investment adviser (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, actions or proceedings (whether commenced
or threatened), reasonable costs (including, without limitation, reasonable
costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and reasonable

                                       14
<PAGE>

expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation) (collectively,
"Losses"), as incurred, arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
prospectus or form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplements thereto or
in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, except to the extent that the
same arise out of or are based upon information furnished in writing to the
Company by such Indemnified Party or the related holder of Registrable Shares
expressly for use therein or (ii) any violation by the Company of any federal,
state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to
action required of or inaction by the Company in connection with any such
registration; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any
Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable
Shares or any other Person, if any, who controls such underwriters within the
meaning of the Securities Act to the extent that any such Losses arise out of or
are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (i) such Person failed to
send or deliver a copy of the prospectus with or prior to the delivery of
written confirmation of the sale by such Person to the Person asserting the
claim from which such Losses arise, (ii) the prospectus would have corrected
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged
omission, and (iii) the Company has complied with its obligations under Section
2.5(c). Each indemnity and reimbursement of costs and expenses shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
such indemnified party.

            (b) Indemnification by Holders. In connection with any Registration
Statement in which a holder of Registrable Shares is participating, such holder,
or an authorized officer of such holder, shall furnish to the Company in writing
such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with
any Registration Statement or prospectus and agrees, severally and not jointly,
to indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors,
officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act),
and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons,
from and against all Losses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
prospectus, or form of prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission
or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only
to the extent, that such untrue or alleged untrue statement is contained in, or
such omission or alleged omission is required to be contained in, any
information so furnished in writing by such holder to the Company expressly for
use in such Registration Statement or prospectus and that such statement or
omission was relied upon by the Company in preparation of such Registration
Statement, prospectus or form of prospectus; provided, however, that such holder
of Registrable Shares shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
the holder has furnished in writing to the Company within a reasonable period of
time prior to the filing of any such Registration Statement or prospectus or
amendment

                                       15
<PAGE>

or supplement thereto information expressly for use in such Registration
Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which corrected
or made not misleading, information previously furnished to the Company, and the
Company failed to include such information therein. In no event shall the
liability of any Selling Securityholder of Registrable Shares hereunder be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of payment of all
expenses) received by such holder upon the sale of the Registrable Shares giving
rise to such indemnification obligation. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such
indemnified party.

            (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Person shall be
entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), such indemnified party
shall give prompt notice to the party or parties from which such indemnity is
sought (the "indemnifying parties") of the commencement of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or written threat thereof (a "Proceeding") with
respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution
pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
indemnifying parties shall not relieve the indemnifying parties from any
obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying parties have
been prejudiced by such failure. The indemnifying parties shall have the right,
exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the
receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such Proceeding, to
assume, at the indemnifying parties' expense, the defense of any such
Proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party;
provided, however, that an indemnified party or parties (if more than one such
indemnified party is named in any Proceeding) shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such indemnified party or parties unless: (i) the indemnifying parties agree to
pay such fees and expenses; (ii) the indemnifying parties fail promptly to
assume the defense of such Proceeding or fail to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party or parties; or (iii) the named parties to
any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such
indemnified party or parties and the indemnifying parties or an affiliate of the
indemnifying parties or such indemnified parties, and there may be one or more
defenses available to such indemnified party or parties that are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying parties, in which case, if
such indemnified party or parties notifies the indemnifying parties in writing
that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying
parties, the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to assume the defense
thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying parties, it
being understood, however, that, unless there exists a conflict among
indemnified parties, the indemnifying parties shall not, in connection with any
one such Proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related Proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate
firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for such
indemnified party or parties. Whether or not such defense is assumed by the
indemnifying parties, such indemnifying parties or indemnified party or parties
will not

                                       16
<PAGE>

be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its or their consent
(but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying parties
shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which
(i) provides for other than monetary damages without the consent of the
indemnified party or parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) or (ii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party or parties of a release,
in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties, from all
liability in respect of such Proceeding for which such indemnified party would
be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

            (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this
Section 2.7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold
such indemnified party harmless for any Losses in respect of which this Section
2.7 would otherwise apply by its terms, then each applicable indemnifying party,
in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have an obligation to
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on
the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified
party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material
fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such
action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result
of any Losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses
incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding, to the extent such
party would have been indemnified for such expenses if the indemnification
provided for in Section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) was available to such party. The
parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this Section 2.7(d). Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 2.7(d), an indemnifying party that is a Selling
Securityholder of Registrable Shares shall not be required to contribute any
amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such
indemnifying party exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying
party has otherwise been required to pay by reasons of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

            2.8 Rule 144. At all times after the Company effects its first
Public Offering, the Company shall file the reports required to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and will

                                       17
<PAGE>

take such further action as any holder of Registrable Shares may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to
sell Registrable Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 or 144A or Regulation S under
the Securities Act. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Shares, the
Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such requirements.

            2.9 Underwritten Registrations.

            (a) No holder of Registrable Shares may participate in any
underwritten registration hereunder unless such holder (A) agrees to sell such
holder's Registrable Shares on the basis provided in any underwriting
arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such
arrangements and (B) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required
under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

            (b) In the case of an underwritten offering requested by holders
pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.3, the price, underwriting discount and other
financial terms for each class of Registrable Shares of the related underwriting
agreement shall be determined by the Securityholders initially exercising such
Demand Rights or rights under Section 2.3 and be acceptable to the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the case of any
underwritten offering pursuant to Section 2.2, such price, discount and other
terms shall be determined by the Company, subject to the right of the holders to
withdraw their request to participate in the registration pursuant to Section
2.2(a) after being advised of such price, discount and other terms.

            2.10 No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not and will not,
enter into any agreement with respect to the Company's securities that is
inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of Registrable Shares in
this Article 2 or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                                   TERMINATION

      3.1 Termination. The provisions of this Agreement shall terminate when
there shall no longer be any Registrable Shares outstanding.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      4.2 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each of the parties agrees
that all actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or based upon this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be brought and maintained
exclusively in the federal and state courts of the State of New York. Each of
the parties hereto by execution hereof (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of New York for the
purpose of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof and (ii) hereby waives to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it
is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that it
is immune from extraterritorial injunctive relief or other injunctive relief,
that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any
such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or maintained in one of the
above-named courts, that any such action, suit or proceeding brought or
maintained in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of
forum non conveniens, should be transferred to any court other than one of the
above-named courts, should be stayed by virtue of the pendency of any other
action, suit or proceeding in any court other than one of the above-named
courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced
in or by any of the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding in any
manner permitted by the laws of the State of New York, agrees that service of
process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at the
address specified in or pursuant to Section 11 is reasonably calculated to give
actual notice and waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise, in any such action, suit

                                       20
<PAGE>

or proceeding any claim that service of process made in accordance with Section
11 does not constitute good and sufficient service of process. The provisions of
this Section 8(b) shall not restrict the ability of any party to enforce in any
court any judgment obtained in a federal or state court of the State of New
York.

      4.3 Successors and Assigns. Each Securityholder may assign its rights
hereunder to any purchaser or transferee of Registrable Shares; provided,
however, that such purchaser or transferee shall, as a condition to the
effectiveness of such assignment, be required to execute a counterpart to this
Agreement, whereupon such purchaser or transferee shall have the benefits of,
and shall be subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement as if such
purchaser or transferee was originally included in the definition of
Securityholder herein and had originally been a party hereto.

      4.4 Duplicate Originals. All parties may sign any number of copies of this
Agreement. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together shall
represent the same agreement.

      4.5 Severability. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity,
legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and the
remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

      4.6 No Waivers; Amendments.

      (a) No failure or delay on the part of the Company or any Securityholder
in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to the Company or
any Securityholder at law or in equity or otherwise.

      (b) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by (i) the Company,
(ii) FNF, and (iii) the Sponsor Group.

                  FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.
                            2005 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

SECTION 1. PURPOSE.

The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel,
to provide additional incentive to persons who provide services to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and to promote the success of the Company's business.
Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used herein are defined
in Section 14.

SECTION 2. ADMINISTRATION.

a. COMMITTEES. The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors or, at
its election, by one or more committees consisting of one or more members who
have been appointed by the Board of Directors. Each committee shall have such
authority and be responsible for such functions as may be delegated to it by the
Board of Directors, and any reference to the Board of Directors in the Plan
shall be construed as a reference to the committee with respect to functions
delegated to it. If no committee has been appointed, the entire Board of
Directors shall administer the Plan.

b. AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The Board of Directors shall have full
authority and sole discretion to take any actions it deems necessary or
advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan, including, without
limitation, the right to construe and interpret the provisions of the Plan or
any Award, to provide for any omission in the Plan, to resolve any ambiguity or
conflict under the Plan or any Award, to accelerate vesting of or otherwise
waive any requirements applicable to any Award, to extend the term or any period
of exercisability of any Award, to modify the purchase price or exercise price
under any Award, to establish terms or conditions applicable to any Award and to
review any decisions or actions made or taken by a Committee. All decisions,
interpretations and other actions of the Board of Directors or, in the absence
of any action by the Board of Directors, any Committee shall be final and
binding on all participants and other persons deriving their rights from a
participant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no action taken by
the Board of Directors shall adversely affect in any material respect the rights
granted to any participant under any outstanding Award without the participant's
written consent.

SECTION 3. ELIGIBILITY

The Board of Directors is authorized to grant Awards to directors, employees and
consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary. Persons who have been granted
Awards shall be participants in the Plan with respect to such Awards.

<PAGE>

SECTION 4. STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN.

a. BASIC LIMITATION. Subject to the following provisions of this Section and
Section 10, the maximum number of shares of common stock, $.0001 par value per
share, of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Awards under the Plan is
[________] Shares(1).

b. ADDITIONAL SHARES. In the event that any outstanding Award expires, is
cancelled or otherwise terminated, any shares allocable to the unexercised or
unvested portion of such Award shall again be available for the purposes of the
Plan. In the event that Shares issued under the Plan are reacquired by the
Company pursuant to any forfeiture provision, right of repurchase, right of
first offer or withholding requirements, such Shares shall again be available
for the purposes of the Plan. In the event a participant pays for any Award
through the delivery of previously acquired Shares, the number of Shares
available shall be increased by the number of Shares delivered by the
participant.

SECTION 5. AWARDS.

a. TYPES OF AWARDS. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, grant
Options or Stock Awards. The Company shall make Awards directly or cause one or
more of its Subsidiaries to make Awards; provided, however, that the Company
shall be responsible for causing any such Subsidiary to comply with the terms of
any Award and the Plan.

b. AWARD AGREEMENTS. Each Award made under the Plan shall be evidenced by a
written agreement between the participant and the Company, and no Award shall be
valid without any such agreement. An Award shall be subject to all applicable
terms and conditions of the Plan and to any other terms and conditions which the
Board of Directors in its sole discretion deems appropriate for inclusion in the
Award agreement provided such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the
Plan. Accordingly, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the
Plan and any such agreement, the provisions of the Plan shall prevail. Awards
made to California participants shall also be subject to the applicable
requirements set forth in Appendix I. Each agreement evidencing an Award shall
provide, in addition to any terms and conditions required to be provided in such
agreement pursuant to any other provision of this Plan, the following terms:

      (i)   Number of Shares. The number of Shares subject to the Award, if any,
            which number shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with
            Section 10 of the Plan.

      (ii)  Price. Where applicable, each agreement shall designate the price,
            if any, to acquire any Shares underlying the Award, which price
            shall be payable in a form described in Section 8 of the Plan and
            subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10 of the Plan.

      (iii) Vesting. Each agreement shall specify the dates and events on which
            all or any installment of the Award shall be vested and
            nonforfeitable. Such provisions,

- -------------------

(1)   Pool to equal 7.5% of the Company's common equity on a fully diluted
      basis.

                                       2
<PAGE>

            may include, without limitation, a provision that Awards vest upon a
            Change in Control.

c. NO RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. A participant, or a transferee of a participant,
shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares covered by an
Award until Shares are actually issued in the name of such person (or if Shares
will be held in street name, to a broker who will hold such Shares on behalf of
such person).

SECTION 6. OPTIONS.

a. OPTION AGREEMENT. The Board of Directors, may in its sole discretion, grant
Options. Each agreement evidencing an Award of Options shall contain the
following information, which shall be determined by the Board of Directors, in
its sole discretion:

      (i)   ISO/Nonstatutory Option. Each agreement shall designate an Option as
            either an ISO or a Nonstatutory Option.

      (ii)  Exercisability. Each agreement shall specify the dates and events
            when all or any installment of the Option becomes exercisable.

      (iii) Term. Each agreement shall state the term of each Option (including
            the circumstances under which such Option will expire prior to the
            stated term thereof), which shall not exceed ten (10) years from the
            date of grant or such shorter term as may be required by Section
            6(b)(iii) below for Ten Percent Stockholders (as defined below).

b. SPECIAL ISO RULES. The following rules apply to ISO grants in addition to any
other rule that may apply under this Plan:

      (i)   ISO Participants. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the
            Company, a Parent or a Subsidiary.

      (ii)  Exercise Price. The exercise price of an ISO shall not be less than
            one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on
            the date of grant or such higher price as may be required by Section
            6(b)(iii) below for Ten Percent Stockholders.

      (iii) Ten Percent Stockholders. An individual who owns more than ten
            percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of
            outstanding stock of the Company, its Parent or any of its
            Subsidiaries ("Ten Percent Stockholders") shall not be eligible for
            designation as a participant under an ISO unless (A) the exercise
            price is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market
            Value of a Share on the date of grant and (B) the ISO is not
            exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of
            grant. In determining stock ownership for purposes hereof, the
            attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply.

                                       3
<PAGE>

      (iv)  Dollar Limitation. The aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares
            (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) for which
            one or more Options granted to any participant under the Plan (or
            any other option plan of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary)
            may for the first time become exercisable as ISOs during any one (1)
            calendar year shall not exceed the sum of One Hundred Thousand
            Dollars ($100,000). To the extent a participant holds two (2) or
            more Options which become exercisable for the first time in the same
            calendar year, such Options shall qualify as ISOs on the basis of
            the order in which such Options were granted.

      (v)   Failure to Qualify. If all or a portion of an Option granted as an
            ISO fails (or later ceases to) qualify as an ISO, such Option or
            portion thereof shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Option.

SECTION 7. STOCK AWARDS.

a. GENERALLY. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, make Stock
Awards by granting or selling Shares under the Plan. A Stock Award may be made
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or such other terms and conditions,
as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Payment in
Shares of all or a portion of any bonus under any other arrangement may be
treated by the Board of Directors as an Award of Shares under the Plan. A Stock
Award shall not be deemed made until accepted by a participant in a manner
described by the Board of Directors at the time of grant and shall thereafter be
deemed to be actually issued in the name of such person (or if Shares will be
held in street name, to a broker who will hold such Shares on behalf of such
person) subject to any restriction on such Stock Award.

b. NO PURCHASE PRICE NECESSARY. In lieu of a purchase price, a Stock Award may
be made in consideration of services previously rendered by a participant to the
Company or a Subsidiary or its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 8. PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

a. GENERAL RULE. The exercise price of an Option shall be payable in cash or
personal check at the time when such Shares are purchased, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 8.

b. SURRENDER OF SHARES. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, all or
any part of the purchase price or exercise price of any Award and any applicable
withholding requirements may be paid by surrendering, or attesting to the
ownership of, Shares that are already owned by the participant. Such Shares
shall be surrendered to the Company in good form for transfer and shall be
valued at their Fair Market Value on the date when the Award is exercised or
purchased. [THE PARTICIPANT SHALL NOT SURRENDER, OR ATTEST TO THE OWNERSHIP OF,
SHARES IN PAYMENT OF ANY PORTION OF THE EXERCISE PRICE (OR WITHHOLDING) OF AN
OPTION IF SUCH ACTION WOULD CAUSE THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY TO RECOGNIZE A
COMPENSATION EXPENSE (OR ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE) WITH RESPECT TO THE
APPLICABLE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, UNLESS THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS CONSENTS THERETO.](2)

- -------------------

(2)   This phrase may not be necessary if accounting treatment not relevant to
      company.

                                       4
<PAGE>

c. SERVICES RENDERED. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, Shares
may be awarded under the Plan in consideration of services rendered to the
Company, a Parent or a Subsidiary prior to or after the Award.

d. PROMISSORY NOTE. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, all or a
portion of the purchase price or exercise price of an Award and any applicable
withholding requirements may be paid with a full-recourse promissory note.
However, the par value of the Shares, if newly issued, shall be paid in cash.
The Shares shall be pledged as security for payment of the principal amount of
the promissory note and interest thereon. The interest rate payable under the
terms of the promissory note shall not be less than the minimum rate (if any)
required to avoid the imputation of additional interest under the Code. Subject
to the foregoing, the Board of Directors (at its sole discretion) shall specify
the term, interest rate, amortization requirements (if any) and other provisions
of such note.

e. NET EXERCISE. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, payment of
all or any portion of the exercise price under any Option granted under the Plan
and any applicable withholding requirements may be made by reducing the number
of Shares otherwise deliverable pursuant to the Option by the number of such
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price.

f. EXERCISE/SALE. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors on or after
an Initial Public Offering, payment may be made in whole or in part by the
delivery (on a form prescribed by the Company) of an irrevocable direction to a
securities broker approved by the Company to sell Shares acquired upon the
exercise of the Option or purchase of an Award and to deliver all or part of the
sales proceeds to the Company in payment of all or part of the purchase price
and any withholding requirements.

g. EXERCISE OF DISCRETION. Should the Board of Directors exercise its sole
discretion to permit the participant to pay the exercise price of an Option in
whole or in part in accordance with Subsections (b) through (f) above, it shall
not be bound to permit such alternative method of payment for the remainder of
any such Option or with respect to any other Option or participant under the
Plan.

SECTION 9. TERMINATION OF SERVICE.

a. TERMINATION OF SERVICE. If a participant's Service terminates for any reason,
then unless the Award agreement provides otherwise:

      (i)   Options. Outstanding Options shall expire on the earlier of: (A) the
            expiration of their term, (B) twelve (12) months following
            termination of the participant's Service as a result of death,
            Disability or Retirement, (C) twelve (12) months following
            termination of the participant's Service without Cause, or (D) the
            date of termination of the participant's Service if such termination
            is for Cause or if such termination is voluntary by the participant.
            However, a participant (or in the case of the participant's death or
            Disability, the participant's representative) may exercise all or a
            part of the participant's Options at any time before the expiration
            of such Options under the preceding sentence only to the extent that
            such Options had become exercisable for vested Shares (in accordance
            with the terms of such Option or otherwise under the Plan) on or
            before the date the

                                       5
<PAGE>

            participant's Service terminates. The balance of the Options (which
            are not exercisable and vested on the date participant's Service
            terminates) shall lapse when the participant's Service terminates.
            If an ISO is not exercised within three (3) months after a
            participant's employment terminates, then unless such participant's
            employment termination is due to his death or Disability, the ISO
            shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Option; and

      (ii)  Stock Awards. The terms of the applicable Stock Award agreement
            shall govern the terms and conditions of a participant's Award with
            respect to termination of service.

b. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. For purposes of this Section, Service shall be deemed to
continue while a participant is a bona fide leave of absence, if such leave is
approved by the Company or applicable Subsidiary in writing or if continued
crediting of service for this purpose is expressly required by the terms of such
leave or by applicable law (as determined by the Board of Directors).

SECTION 10. ADJUSTMENT OF SHARES.

a. GENERAL. If there shall be a Recapitalization, an adjustment shall be made to
the number of shares authorized by Section 4 hereof and each outstanding Award
such that each such Award shall thereafter be exercisable or payable, as the
case may be, in such securities, cash and/or other property as would have been
received in respect of Shares subject to such Award had such Award been
exercised and/or settled in full immediately prior to such Recapitalization and
such an adjustment shall be made successively each time any such change shall
occur. In addition, in the event of any Recapitalization, to prevent dilution or
enlargement of participants' rights under the Plan, the Board of Directors
shall, and will have the authority to adjust, in a fair and equitable manner,
the number and kind of Shares that may be issued under the Plan, the number and
kind of Shares subject to outstanding Awards, and the purchase price applicable
to outstanding Awards. Should the vesting of any Award be conditioned upon the
Company's attainment of performance conditions, the Board of Directors may make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of such Awards and the criteria
therein to recognize unusual and nonrecurring events affecting the Company or in
response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not without a
participant's consent make any adjustment to an ISO that does not comply with
the rules of Section 424(a) of the Code or would otherwise cause the ISO to fail
to qualify as an ISO for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.

b. MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS. If the Company is to be consolidated with or
acquired by another entity in a merger, sale of all or substantially all of the
Company's assets or otherwise, or in the event of any other transaction that
constitutes a Change in Control, outstanding Awards shall be subject to the
agreement of merger or consolidation. Such agreement, without the participants'
consent, may provide for:

      (i)   The continuation or assumption of such outstanding Awards under the
            Plan by the Company (if it is the surviving corporation) or by the
            surviving corporation or its parent;

                                       6
<PAGE>

      (ii)  The substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of stock
            awards with substantially the same terms for such outstanding
            Awards;

      (iii) The acceleration of the vesting of or right to exercise such
            outstanding Awards immediately prior to or as of the date of the
            merger or consolidation, and the expiration of such outstanding
            Awards to the extent not vested, or not timely exercised or
            purchased by the date of the merger or consolidation or other date
            thereafter designated by the Board of Directors; or

      (iv)  The cancellation of all or any portion of such outstanding Awards by
            a cash payment of the excess, if any, of the fair market value of
            the Shares subject to such outstanding Awards or portion thereof
            being canceled over the purchase price with respect to such Awards
            or portion thereof being canceled.

SECTION 11. SECURITIES LAW REQUIREMENTS.

a. SHARES NOT REGISTERED. Shares shall not be issued under the Plan unless the
issuance and delivery of such Shares comply with (or are exempt from) all
applicable requirements of law, including (without limitation) the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, state
securities laws and regulations, and the regulations of any stock exchange or
other securities market on which the Company's securities may then be traded.
Except as may be provided in an Award agreement, the Company shall not be
obligated to file any registration statement under any applicable securities
laws to permit the purchase or issuance of any Shares under the Plan, and
accordingly any certificates for Shares may have an appropriate legend or
statement of applicable restrictions endorsed thereon. Each participant and any
person deriving its rights from any participant shall, as a condition to the
exercise or purchase of an Award under the Plan, deliver to the Company an
agreement or certificate containing such representations, warranties and
covenants as the Company may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that the
issuance of Shares is not required to be registered under any applicable
securities laws.

b. CALIFORNIA PARTICIPANTS. If an Award shall be granted to a participant based
in California, then such Award shall meet the additional requirements set forth
in Appendix I.

                                       7
<PAGE>

SECTION 12. GENERAL TERMS.

a. NONTRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS. No Award (other than vested, unrestricted Stock
Awards) may be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated by any participant
during the participant's lifetime, whether by operation of law or otherwise, or
be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process, except by
beneficiary designation, will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject
to the limitations contained in this Section, an Option or other right to
acquire Shares under the Plan, may be exercised during the lifetime of the
participant only by the participant or by the participant's guardian or legal
representative. Such Option or other right shall not be transferable and shall
be exercisable only by the participant to whom such right was granted, except in
the case of a transfer by the participant to its affiliate with the prior
written consent of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

b. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF SHARES. Any Shares issued under the Plan shall be
subject to such vesting and special forfeiture conditions, repurchase rights,
rights of first offer and other transfer restrictions as the Board of Directors
may determine. Such restrictions shall be set forth in the applicable Award
agreement, and shall apply in addition to any restrictions that may apply to
holders of Shares generally.

c. WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS. As a condition to the receipt of Shares pursuant to
the purchase, receipt or vesting of Shares pursuant to an Award, a participant
shall make such arrangements as the Board of Directors may require for the
satisfaction of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding obligations
that may arise in connection with such receipt or purchase. The participant
shall also make such arrangements as the Board of Directors may require for the
satisfaction of any federal, state, local or foreign withholding obligations
that may arise in connection with the disposition of Shares acquired pursuant to
the exercise of an Option.

d. NO RETENTION RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan or in any Award granted under the
Plan shall confer upon a participant any right to continue in Service for any
period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way
the rights of the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining
the participant) or of the participant, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved by each, to terminate his or her Service at any time and for any
reason, with or without Cause.

e. UNFUNDED PLAN. Participants shall have no right, title or interest whatsoever
in or to any investments which the Company may make to aid it in meeting its
obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken
pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of
any kind, nor a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any participant,
beneficiary, legal representative or any other person. To the extent that any
person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan,
such right shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general creditor
of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general
funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no
segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts. The Plan
is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended.

SECTION 13. DURATION AND AMENDMENTS.

a. TERM OF THE PLAN. The Plan, as set forth herein, shall become effective on
the date of its adoption by the Board of Directors, subject to the approval of
the majority of the Company's stockholders. If a majority of the stockholders
fail to approve the Plan within 12 months of its adoption by the Board of
Directors, any Awards that have already been made shall be rescinded, and no
additional Awards shall be made thereafter under the Plan. The Plan shall
terminate automatically on the day preceding the tenth anniversary of its
adoption by the Board of Directors unless earlier terminated pursuant to
Subsection (b) below.

b. RIGHT TO AMEND OR TERMINATE THE PLAN. The Board of Directors may amend,
suspend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason; provided, however,
that any amendment of the Plan which increases the maximum number of Shares
issuable to any person or available for issuance under the Plan in the aggregate
(except as provided in Section 10), changes the legal entity authorized to make
Awards under this Plan from the Company (or its successor) to any other legal
entity or which materially changes the class of persons who are eligible for the
grant of ISOs, shall be subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders.
Stockholder approval shall not be required for any other amendment of the Plan.

c. EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. Any amendment of the Plan shall not
adversely affect in any material respect any participant's rights under any
Award previously made or granted under the Plan without the participant's
consent. No Shares shall be issued or sold under the Plan after the termination
thereof, except pursuant to an Award granted prior to such termination. The
termination of the Plan shall not affect any Awards outstanding on the
termination date.

d. MODIFICATION, EXTENSION AND ASSUMPTION OF AWARDS. Within the limitations of
the Plan, the Board of Directors may modify, extend or assume outstanding Awards
or may provide for the cancellation of outstanding Awards in return for the
grant of new Awards for the same or a different number of Shares and at the same
or a different price. The foregoing notwithstanding, no modification of an
Awards shall, without the consent of the participant, materially impair the
participant's rights or increase the participant's obligations under such Award
or impair the economic value of any such Award.

                                   APPENDIX I
                     CALIFORNIA SECURITIES LAW REQUIREMENTS

The terms of this Appendix I apply only to Awards that would be subject to
Section 25110 of the California Corporations Code or any successor law but for
the exemption contained in Section 25102(o) of the California Corporation Code
(or any successor law). For purposes of determining the applicability of the
California securities law requirements contained in this Subsection, all Awards
shall be deemed made in the State in which the participant is principally
employed by the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary (as determined by the
employer's records) on the date of grant or issuance of the Award. Except as
modified by the provisions of this Appendix I, all the other relevant provisions
of the Plan shall be applicable to such Awards.

            (i) Number of Securities. At no time shall the total number of
      securities issuable upon exercise of all outstanding Options and the total
      number of Shares provided for under this or any stock bonus or similar

            (A)   A Nonstatutory Option or other right to acquire shares (other
                  than an ISO) may, to the extent permitted by the Board of

                  the participant's immediate family or (2) by instrument to an

                  passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustor
                  (settlor). The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall
                  be the same as those in effect for the Award immediately prior
                  to such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents
                  issued to the assignee as the Board of Directors may deem
                  appropriate.

            (B)   Except as provided in Subsection (A) above, an Award may not
                  be assigned or transferred other than by will or by the laws

      statement at least annually to each participant holding Awards or Shares
      issued under the Plan, unless such participant is a key employee whose
      duties in connection with the Company assure such individual access to
      equivalent information.

                              MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

      This Management Agreement (this "AGREEMENT") is entered into as of the ___
day of ________, 2005, by and between Fidelity National Information Services,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY") and TPG GenPar IV, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (the "SPONSOR").

            WHEREAS, certain affiliates of the Sponsor (the "INVESTORS"),
together with other co-investors, have acquired shares of the capital stock of
the Company (the "INVESTMENT") pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement, by and among the Company, the Investors and the persons listed on the
signatures pages thereto (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT").

            WHEREAS, the Sponsor has staff specifically skilled in corporate
finance, strategic corporate planning, and other management skills and advisory
services.

            WHEREAS, in connection with the Investment and related transactions,
the Sponsor provided advice and analysis including advice with respect to debt
facilities and arrangements, and related arrangements and other matters
(collectively, "ADVISORY SERVICES").

            WHEREAS, the Company will require the Sponsor's special skills
and management advisory services in connection with its business operations and
execution of its strategic plan.

            WHEREAS, the Sponsor is willing to provide such skills and services
to the Company.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

      1. Services. The Sponsor hereby agrees that if, during the term of this
Agreement (the "TERM"), the Company reasonably and specifically requests that
the Sponsor provide the services set forth below and, in the case of the
services described in subsections (a) and (b), the Sponsor agrees to provide
such services, the Sponsor or one of its affiliates will provide the following
services to the Company and its subsidiaries:

      (b) advice with respect to the development and implementation of
strategies for improving the operating, marketing and financial performance of
the Company, and other senior management matters related to the business,
administration and policies of the Company; and

      (c) review and comment on the descriptive memorandums of potential
acquisition opportunities for the Company.

<PAGE>

      The Sponsor shall have no obligation to the Company as to the method or
timing of services rendered hereunder (provided that services shall be rendered
in a reasonably timely manner), and the Company shall not have any right to
dictate or direct the details of the performance of services by the Sponsor
rendered hereunder.

      The parties hereto expressly acknowledge that the services to be performed
hereunder by the Sponsor shall not include investment banking or other financial
advisory services rendered by Sponsor or its affiliates to the Company in
connection with any specific acquisition, divestiture, refinancing or
recapitalization by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which the Sponsor
may be entitled to receive additional compensation by mutual agreement of the
Company or its subsidiary and the Sponsor. This Agreement shall in no way
prohibit the Sponsor or any of its affiliates or any of their respective
partners (both general and limited), members (both managing and otherwise),
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives from engaging in other
activities, whether or not competitive with any business of the Company of any
of its affiliates.

      2. Payment of Fees. In exchange for the Advisory Services and the
Sponsor's agreement to provide the services described in clauses (a), (b) or (c)
of Section 1, the Company hereby agrees to pay to the Sponsor (or its
designee(s)) the following fees:

            (a) a transaction fee in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Purchase Agreement payable at the Closing (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) of $12,500,000; and

            (b) an annual management fee (the "FEE"), payable in advance in
semi-annual installments beginning at the Closing (as described below) and
thereafter on the first business day of January and July of each year in an
amount per year equal to $1,250,000.

Each payment made pursuant to this Section 2 shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified on Exhibit A attached
hereto, or to such other account(s) as the Sponsor may specify in writing to the
Company. The first installment of the Fee shall be payable at the Closing. All
references to "per annum" or "annual" herein refer to the fiscal year of the
Company. The initial payment of the annual Fee (for the period from the Closing
Date to July 1, 2005) shall be prorated to reflect the portion of the current
fiscal year which elapses prior to the Closing.

      3. Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date hereof and shall
continue in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) five (5) years from
the date hereof, or (ii) the consummation of a public offering of equity
securities of the Company. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each of (a)
the obligations of the Company under Section 4 below, (b) any and all owed and
unpaid obligations of the Company under Section 2 above, and (c) the provisions
of Section 7, shall survive any termination of this Agreement to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law.

      4. Expenses; Indemnification.

      (a) Expenses. In addition to the fees set forth in Section 2 hereof, the
Company agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses incurred by the Sponsor
and its affiliates or any of them in connection with this Agreement and in
connection with performing services hereunder including

                                       2
<PAGE>

but not limited to air travel charged at charter equivalent rates, legal,
consulting, out of pocket and other expenses, including but not limited to the
fees and disbursements of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, counsel to the
Sponsor, and any other consultants or advisors retained by the Sponsor or its
counsel arising in connection therewith, and the performance of services
hereunder (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of independent
professionals, research, transportation and per diem costs).

      (b) Indemnity and Liability. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless
each of the Sponsor, its affiliates and their respective partners (both general
and limited), members (both managing and otherwise), officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (each such Person being an "Indemnified
Party") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities,
whether joint or several, expenses of any nature (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, settlements and other
amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitral or investigative, in which an
Indemnified Party was involved or may be involved, or threatened to be involved,
as a party or otherwise (the "Liabilities"), related to, arising out of or in
connection with the advisory and consulting services contemplated by this
Agreement or the engagement of the Sponsors pursuant to, and the performance by
the Sponsors of the services contemplated by, this Agreement, and any other
action taken by an Indemnified Party on behalf of the Company, whether or not
pending or threatened, and any other action taken by an Indemnified Party on
behalf of the Company, whether or not resulting in any liability and whether or
not such action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding is initiated or
brought by the Company. The Company will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) as they are incurred in connection with investigating, preparing,
pursuing, defending or assisting in the defense of any action, claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding for which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification under the terms of the previous sentence, or any action or
proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party
thereto, provided that, subject to the following sentence, the Company shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in its reasonable judgment. Any
Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to
participate in such defense, and in any action, claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding in which both the Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and an Indemnified Party, on the other hand, is, or is reasonably
likely to become, a party, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
one separate counsel at the expense of the Company and to control its own
defense of such action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding if, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the Company, on the one hand, and such Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, that would make such separate representation
advisable. The Company agrees that it will not, without the prior written
consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, suit,
investigation, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated hereby
(if any Indemnified Party is a party thereto or has been threatened to be made a
party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of the applicable Indemnified Party and each other
Indemnified Party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such
claim, suit, investigation, action or proceeding. Provided the Company is not in
breach of its indemnification obligations hereunder, no Indemnified Party shall
settle or compromise any claim subject to indemnification hereunder without the
consent of the Company. The Company will not be liable under the foregoing
indemnification provision with respect to any

                                       3
<PAGE>

Indemnified Party, to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability, cost
or expense is determined by a court, in a final judgment from which no further
appeal may be taken, to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct by an Indemnified Party. If an Indemnified Party is
reimbursed hereunder for any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be
refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the Liabilities
in question resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnified Party. As used herein, the term "Person" shall be construed
in the broadest sense and means and includes a natural person, a partnership, a
corporation, an association, a joint stock company, a limited liability company,
a trust, a joint venture, an unincorporated organization and any other entity
and any federal, state, municipal, foreign or other government, governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, or any private
or public court or tribunal.

      The Company agrees that if any indemnification sought by any Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 4 is unavailable for any reason or is
insufficient to hold the Indemnified Party harmless against any Liabilities
referred to herein, then the Company shall contribute to the Liabilities for
which such indemnification is held unavailable or insufficient in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received (or
anticipated to be received) by the Company, on the one hand, and the Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, in connection with the transactions which gave rise to
such Liabilities or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, not
only such relative benefits but also the relative faults of the Company, on the
one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, as well as any other
equitable considerations, subject to the limitation that in any event the
aggregate contribution by the Indemnified Parties to all Liabilities with
respect to which contribution is available hereunder shall not exceed the fees
actually received by the Sponsor in connection with the transaction which gave
rise to such Liabilities (excluding any amounts paid as reimbursement of
expenses).

      5. Assignment, etc. Except as provided below, no party hereto shall have
the right to assign this Agreement. The Sponsor acknowledges that its services
under this Agreement are unique. Accordingly, any purported assignment by the
Sponsor (other than as specifically permitted below) shall be void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor may assign all or part of its rights
and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of the Sponsor which provides
services similar to those called for by this Agreement.

      6. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any term, provision
or condition of this Agreement shall be effective, unless in writing and
executed by the Sponsor and the Company. No waiver on any one occasion shall
extend to or effect or be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy on any
future occasion. No course of dealing of any Person nor any delay or omission in
exercising any right or remedy shall constitute an amendment of this Agreement
or a waiver of any right or remedy of any party hereto.

      7. Miscellaneous.

      (a) Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would

proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof and (ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable law,

is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or maintained in one of the above-named courts,

process in any such suit, action or proceeding in any manner permitted by the
laws of the State of New York, agrees that service of process by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address specified in or
pursuant to Section 11 is reasonably calculated to give actual notice and waives

such action, suit or proceeding any claim that service of process made in
accordance with Section 11 does not constitute good and sufficient service of
process. The provisions of this Section 8(b) shall not restrict the ability of
any party to enforce in any court any judgment obtained in a federal or state
court of the State of New York.

ARISING AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been informed by each other party that the provisions
of this Section 7(c) constitute a material inducement upon which such party is
relying and will rely in entering into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any of the parties hereto may file an original counterpart
or a copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

      1. Services. The Sponsor hereby agrees that if, during the term of this
Agreement (the "TERM"), the Company reasonably and specifically requests that
the Sponsor provide the services set forth below and, in the case of the
services described in subsections (a) and (b), the Sponsor agrees to provide
such services, the Sponsor or one of its affiliates will provide the following

the Company, and other senior management matters related to the business,

      (c) review and comment on the descriptive memorandums of potential

<PAGE>

the Company shall not have any right to dictate or direct the details of the
performance of services by the Sponsor rendered hereunder.

      The parties hereto expressly acknowledge that the services to be performed
hereunder by the Sponsor shall not include investment banking or other financial
advisory services rendered by Sponsor or its affiliates to the Company in
connection with any specific acquisition, divestiture, refinancing or
recapitalization by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which the Sponsor
may be entitled to receive additional compensation by mutual agreement of the
Company or its subsidiary and the Sponsor. This Agreement shall in no way
prohibit the Sponsor or any of its affiliates or any of their respective
partners (both general and limited), members (both managing and otherwise),
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives from engaging in other
activities, whether or not competitive with any business of the Company of any
of its affiliates.

      2. Payment of Fees. In exchange for the Advisory Services and the
Sponsor's agreement to provide the services described in clauses (a), (b) or (c)
of Section 1, the Company hereby agrees to pay to the Sponsor (or its
designee(s)) the following fees:

            (a) a transaction fee in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Purchase Agreement payable at the Closing (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) of $12,500,000; and

            (b) an annual management fee (the "FEE"), payable in advance in

amount per year equal to $1,250,000.

Each payment made pursuant to this Section 2 shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified on Exhibit A attached
hereto, or to such other account(s) as the Sponsor may specify in writing to the
Company. The first installment of the Fee shall be payable at the Closing. All
references to "per annum" or "annual" herein refer to the fiscal year of the
Company. The initial payment of the annual Fee (for the period from the Closing
Date to July 1, 2005) shall be prorated to reflect the portion of the current
fiscal year which elapses prior to the Closing.

      3. Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date hereof and shall
continue in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) five (5) years from
the date hereof, or (ii) the consummation of a public offering of equity
securities of the Company. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each of (a)
the obligations of the Company under Section 4 below, (b) any and all owed and
unpaid obligations of the Company under Section 2 above, and (c) the provisions
of Section 7, shall survive any termination of this Agreement to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law.

      4. Expenses; Indemnification.

      (a) Expenses. In addition to the fees set forth in Section 2 hereof, the
Company agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses incurred by the Sponsor
and its affiliates or any of them in connection with this Agreement and in
connection with performing services hereunder including but not limited to air
travel charged at charter equivalent rates, legal, consulting, out of pocket and
other expenses, including but not limited to the fees and disbursements of Weil,
Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to the Sponsor, and any other consultants or
advisors retained by the Sponsor or its

                                       2
<PAGE>

counsel arising in connection therewith, and the performance of services
hereunder (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of independent
professionals, research, transportation and per diem costs).

      (b) Indemnity and Liability. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless
each of the Sponsor, its affiliates and their respective partners (both general
and limited), members (both managing and otherwise), officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (each such Person being an "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities,
whether joint or several, expenses of any nature (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, settlements and other
amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitral or investigative, in which an
Indemnified Party was involved or may be involved, or threatened to be involved,
as a party or otherwise (the "LIABILITIES"), related to, arising out of or in
connection with the advisory and consulting services contemplated by this
Agreement or the engagement of the Sponsors pursuant to, and the performance by
the Sponsors of the services contemplated by, this Agreement, and any other
action taken by an Indemnified Party on behalf of the Company, whether or not
pending or threatened, and any other action taken by an Indemnified Party on
behalf of the Company, whether or not resulting in any liability and whether or
not such action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding is initiated or
brought by the Company. The Company will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) as they are incurred in connection with investigating, preparing,
pursuing, defending or assisting in the defense of any action, claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding for which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification under the terms of the previous sentence, or any action or
proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party
thereto, provided that, subject to the following sentence, the Company shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in its reasonable judgment. Any
Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to
participate in such defense, and in any action, claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding in which both the Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and an Indemnified Party, on the other hand, is, or is reasonably
likely to become, a party, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
one separate counsel at the expense of the Company and to control its own
defense of such action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding if, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the Company, on the one hand, and such Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, that would make such separate representation
advisable. The Company agrees that it will not, without the prior written
consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, suit,
investigation, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated hereby
(if any Indemnified Party is a party thereto or has been threatened to be made a
party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of the applicable Indemnified Party and each other
Indemnified Party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such
claim, suit, investigation, action or proceeding. Provided the Company is not in
breach of its indemnification obligations hereunder, no Indemnified Party shall
settle or compromise any claim subject to indemnification hereunder without the
consent of the Company. The Company will not be liable under the foregoing
indemnification provision with respect to any Indemnified Party, to the extent
that any loss, claim, damage, liability, cost or expense is determined by a
court, in a final judgment from which no further appeal may be taken, to have
resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct by an
Indemnified Party. If an Indemnified Party is reimbursed hereunder for any
expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall

                                       3
<PAGE>

be refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the
Liabilities in question resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Party. As used herein, the term "PERSON" shall be
construed in the broadest sense and means and includes a natural person, a
partnership, a corporation, an association, a joint stock company, a limited
liability company, a trust, a joint venture, an unincorporated organization and
any other entity and any federal, state, municipal, foreign or other government,
governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
or any private or public court or tribunal.

      The Company agrees that if any indemnification sought by any Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 4 is unavailable for any reason or is
insufficient to hold the Indemnified Party harmless against any Liabilities
referred to herein, then the Company shall contribute to the Liabilities for
which such indemnification is held unavailable or insufficient in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received (or
anticipated to be received) by the Company, on the one hand, and the Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, in connection with the transactions which gave rise to
such Liabilities or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, not
only such relative benefits but also the relative faults of the Company, on the
one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, as well as any other
equitable considerations, subject to the limitation that in any event the
aggregate contribution by the Indemnified Parties to all Liabilities with
respect to which contribution is available hereunder shall not exceed the fees
actually received by the Sponsor in connection with the transaction which gave
rise to such Liabilities (excluding any amounts paid as reimbursement of
expenses).

      5. Assignment, etc. Except as provided below, no party hereto shall have
the right to assign this Agreement. The Sponsor acknowledges that its services
under this Agreement are unique. Accordingly, any purported assignment by the
Sponsor (other than as specifically permitted below) shall be void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor may assign all or part of its rights
and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of the Sponsor which provides
services similar to those called for by this Agreement.

      6. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any term, provision
or condition of this Agreement shall be effective, unless in writing and
executed by the Sponsor and the Company. No waiver on any one occasion shall
extend to or effect or be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy on any
future occasion. No course of dealing of any Person nor any delay or omission in
exercising any right or remedy shall constitute an amendment of this Agreement
or a waiver of any right or remedy of any party hereto.

      7. Miscellaneous.

      (a) Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of New York without

(ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action,

hereunder.

            (b) If indemnification is requested under Section 3(b) and

                  (i) it has been adjudicated finally by a court of competent
jurisdiction that, in connection with the subject of the Proceeding out of which
the claim for indemnification has arisen, Indemnitee failed to act in good faith
and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Company, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of
Indemnifiable Expenses hereunder;

                  (ii) it has been adjudicated finally by a court of competent
jurisdiction that Indemnitee is liable to the Company with respect to any claim,
issue or matter involved in the Proceeding out of which the claim for
indemnification has arisen, including, without limitation, a claim that
Indemnitee received an improper personal benefit or improperly took advantage of
a corporate opportunity, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of
Indemnifiable Expenses hereunder with respect to such claim, issue or matter
unless the court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such Indemnifiable Expenses which such court shall deem proper; or

                  (iii) it has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction that Indemnitee is liable to the Company for an accounting of
profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the
Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and amendments
thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law.

      5. Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to the
right of indemnification, Indemnitee agrees notify the Company in writing as
soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which indemnification will or could be
sought by Indemnitee and provide the Company with a copy of any summons,
citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document
relating to such Proceeding with which Indemnitee is served; provided that the
failure of Indemnitee to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the
Company is adversely affected by such failure. With respect to any Proceeding of
which the Company is so notified, the Company will be entitled to participate
therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own
expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice
from the Company to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the
Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as
provided below in this Section 5. Indemnitee shall

                                       3
<PAGE>

have the right to employ Indemnitee's own counsel in connection with such claim,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company
of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee
unless (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the
Company, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the
Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, (iii)
counsel to Indemnitee reasonably concludes that Indemnitee may have separate
defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be
consistent with the position of other defendants in such Proceeding or (iv) the
Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such
action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee
shall be at the expense of the Company, except as otherwise expressly provided
by this Agreement. The Company shall not be entitled, without the consent of
Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the
Company or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the
conclusion provided for in clauses (ii) or (iii) above. The Company shall not
settle any Proceeding in any manner, without Indemnitee's written consent, which
would (i) impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee, (ii) includes an
admission of fault of Indemnitee, or (iii) does not include, as an unconditional
term thereof, the full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of
such Proceeding, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Indemnitee. The Indemnitee will not unreasonably withhold his
consent to any proposed settlement. In making the determination required to be
made under Delaware law with respect to entitlement to indemnification
hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume
that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if
Indemnitee has submitted a request therefor in accordance with Section 5 of this
Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that
presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of
any determination contrary to that presumption.

      6. Procedure for Payment of Indemnifiable Amounts. As a condition
precedent to the right of indemnification, Indemnitee shall submit to the
Company a written request, including such documentation and information as are
reasonably available to Indemnitee and necessary to establish that Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, specifying the Indemnifiable Amounts for
which Indemnitee seeks payment under Section 3 or Section 9 of this Agreement
and the basis for the claim. Subject to Section 4, the Company shall pay such
Indemnifiable Amounts to Indemnitee within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt
of the request. At the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall furnish such
documentation and information as are reasonably available to Indemnitee and
necessary to establish that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder.

      7. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and without
limiting any such provision, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of
Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or
otherwise, in any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all
Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in
connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding
but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than
all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify
Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on
Indemnitee's behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim,

                                       4
<PAGE>

issue or matter. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim,
issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice,
shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      8. Effect of Certain Resolutions. Neither the settlement nor termination
of any Proceeding nor the failure of the Company to award indemnification or to
determine that indemnification is payable shall create an adverse presumption
that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In addition, the
termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not create a presumption
that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company
or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that Indemnitee's action was unlawful.

      9. Agreement to Advance Interim Expenses. The Company shall pay to
Indemnitee all Indemnifiable Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
any Proceeding, including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company, in
advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, if Indemnitee furnishes the
Company with a written undertaking to repay the amount of such Indemnifiable
Expenses advanced to Indemnitee if it is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is not entitled under this Agreement to
indemnification with respect to such Indemnifiable Expenses, which undertaking
shall be an unsecured general obligation of the Indemnitee. The terms and
conditions of such undertaking shall be determined by a quorum of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors, if any, acting in good faith
and as required by the proper exercise of their fiduciary duties or, if not
available, then by the written opinion of independent legal counsel or by the
Company's shareholders.

      10. Procedure for Payment of Interim Expenses. Indemnitee shall submit to
the Company a written request specifying the Indemnifiable Expenses for which
Indemnitee seeks an advancement under Section 9 of this Agreement, together with
documentation evidencing that Indemnitee has incurred such Indemnifiable
Expenses. Payment of Indemnifiable Expenses under Section 9 shall be made no
later than twenty (20) calendar days after the Company's receipt of such request
and the undertaking required by Section 9.

      11. Remedies of Indemnitee.

            (a) Right to Petition Court. In the event that Indemnitee makes a
request for payment of Indemnifiable Amounts under Sections 3 and 6 above or a
request for an advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses under Sections 9 and 10
above and the Company fails to make such payment or advancement in a timely
manner pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Indemnitee may petition the
appropriate judicial authority to enforce the Company's obligations under this
Agreement.

            (b) Burden of Proof. In any judicial proceeding brought under
Section 11(a) above, the Company shall have the burden of proving that
Indemnitee is not entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder.

                                       5
<PAGE>

            (c) Expenses. The Company agrees to reimburse Indemnitee in full for
any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with investigating, preparing
for, litigating, defending or settling any action brought by Indemnitee under
Section 11(a) above, or in connection with any claim or counterclaim brought by
the Company in connection therewith.

            (d) Validity of Agreement. The Company shall be precluded from
asserting in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, an action under
Section 11(a) above, that the provisions of this Agreement are not valid,
binding and enforceable or that there is insufficient consideration for this
Agreement and shall stipulate in court that the Company is bound by all the
provisions of this Agreement.

            (e) Failure to Act Not a Defense. The failure of the Company
(including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal
counsel, or shareholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility
of the payment of Indemnifiable Amounts or the advancement of Indemnifiable
Expenses under this Agreement shall not be a defense in any action brought under
Section 11(a) above, and shall not create a presumption that such payment or
advancement is not permissible.

      12. Mutual Acknowledgement. Both the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge
that in certain instances, Federal law or applicable public policy may prohibit
the Company from indemnifying its directors and officers under the Agreement or
otherwise. Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company may be
required in the future to undertake with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to submit the question of indemnification to a court in certain circumstances
for a determination of the Company's right under public policy to indemnify
Indemnitee.

      13. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Indemnitee that it has all necessary corporate power
and authority to enter into, and be bound by the terms of, this Agreement, and
the execution, delivery and performance of the undertakings contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly authorized by the Company. This Agreement, when
executed and delivered by the Company in accordance with the provisions hereof,
shall be a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

      14. Insurance. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and maintain a policy or policies of director's liability insurance
customary for similarly situated companies in an amount not less than [ ] with
reputable insurance companies providing the members of the Board of Directors
with coverage for losses from wrongful acts, and to ensure the Company's
performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. In all
policies of director and officer liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be named
as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee at least the same rights
and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company's
officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company, after
employing commercially reasonable efforts as provided in this Section,
determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, if the
premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate to the amount of coverage
provided, or if

                                       6
<PAGE>

the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to
provide an insufficient benefit, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with
coverage having features as similar as practicable to those described above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent the Indemnitee is actually reimbursed
from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Company makes any
indemnification payments to the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee is subsequently
reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, the Indemnitee shall promptly refund
such indemnification payments to the Company to the extent of such insurance
reimbursement.

      15. Fees and Expenses. During the term of the Indemnitee's service as a
director, the Company shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for all reasonable
and documented expenses incurred by him in connection with his service as a
director or member of any board committee or otherwise in connection with the
Company's business.

      16. Contract Rights Not Exclusive. The rights to payment of Indemnifiable
Amounts and advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses provided by this Agreement
shall be in addition to, but not exclusive of, any other rights which Indemnitee
may have at any time under applicable law, the Company's Bylaws, as amended, the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or any other agreement, vote
of shareholders or directors, or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee's
official capacity and as to action in any other capacity as a result of
Indemnitees's serving as a director of the Company.

      17. Successors. This Agreement shall be (a) binding upon all successors
and assigns of the Company (including any transferee of all or a substantial
portion of the business, stock and/or assets of the Company and any direct or
indirect successor by merger or consolidation or otherwise by operation of law)
and (b) binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, personal
representatives, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. This Agreement
shall continue for the benefit of Indemnitee and such heirs, personal
representatives, executors and administrators after Indemnitee has ceased to
have Corporate Status.

      18. Subrogation. In the event of any payment of Indemnifiable Amounts
under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to all of the rights of contribution or recovery of Indemnitee against
other persons, and Indemnitee shall take, at the request of the Company, all
reasonable action necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of
such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce
such rights.

      19. Change in Law. To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether
by statute or judicial decision) shall permit broader indemnification than is
provided under the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company, as amended, and this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to such
broader indemnification and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to such
extent.

      20. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement, or any clause thereof,
shall be determined by a court of competent

                                       7
<PAGE>

jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such
provision or clause shall be limited or modified in its application to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision or clause valid, legal and
enforceable, and the remaining provisions and clauses of this Agreement shall
remain fully enforceable and binding on the parties.

      21. Indemnitee as Plaintiff. Except as provided in Section 11 of this
Agreement and in the next sentence, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment
of Indemnifiable Amounts or advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses with respect
to any Proceeding brought by Indemnitee against the Company, any Entity which it
controls, any director or officer thereof, or any third party, unless the
Company has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding. This Section shall
not apply to affirmative defenses asserted by Indemnitee in an action brought
against Indemnitee.

      22. Modifications and Waiver. Except as provided in Section 19 above with
respect to changes in applicable law which broaden the right of Indemnitee to be
indemnified by the Company, no supplement, modification or amendment of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each of the parties
hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement (whether or
not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

      23. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall continue until and terminate
upon the later of (a) six years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased
to serve as an officer or director of the Company or (b) the final termination
of all Proceedings pending on the date set forth in clause (a) in respect of
which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses
hereunder.

      24. General Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given (a) when delivered by hand, (b) when transmitted by facsimile and
receipt is acknowledged, or (c) if mailed by certified or registered mail with
postage prepaid, on the third business day after the date on which it is so

[FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL LOGO]                                 PRESS RELEASE

  FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. ANNOUNCES THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE STOCK
PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. TO SELL A 25
  PERCENT MINORITY EQUITY INTEREST TO AN INVESTMENT GROUP LED BY THOMAS H. LEE
                        PARTNERS AND TEXAS PACIFIC GROUP

      Jacksonville, Fla. -- (December 23, 2004) -- Fidelity National Financial,
      Inc. (NYSE:FNF), a Fortune 500 provider of products and outsourced
      services and solutions to financial institutions and the real estate
      industry, today announced that it and its subsidiary Fidelity National
      Information Services, Inc. ("FIS") have entered into a definitive stock
      purchase agreement under which FIS will sell an approximately 25 percent
      minority equity interest in the common stock of FIS to an investment group
      led by Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. ("THL") and Texas Pacific Group
      ("TPG") for a total purchase price of approximately $500 million. The
      parties previously announced the signing of a letter of intent related to
      this minority equity interest sale in connection with the announcement of
      the planned recapitalization of FIS made on December 8, 2004. FNF is
      currently in the negotiation process with a consortium of lenders with
      respect to those credit facilities necessary to consummate the planned
      recapitalization of FIS.

            Under the terms of the definitive stock purchase agreement, FIS will
      issue a total of approximately 50 million shares of the common stock of
      FIS to the investment group led THL and TPG for a combined approximately
      25 percent minority equity ownership position. A new Board of Directors
      will be created at FIS, with William P. Foley, II, current Chairman and
      Chief Executive Officer of FNF, serving as Chairman and Chief Executive
      Officer of FIS. FNF will have the right to appoint a majority of the new
      directors, with both THL and TPG each receiving the right to appoint two
      members to the FIS Board of Directors. The definitive agreement calls for
      the establishment of an option pool for members of FIS management to
      purchase an aggregate 7.5 percent of the fully-diluted shares of FIS at
      the same price paid by the investment group led

<PAGE>

      by THL and TPG for their combined approximately 25 percent minority equity
      interest in FIS. A portion of the options will be subject to time-based,
      quarterly vesting over four- and five-year periods, while the other
      portion will be subject to performance-based vesting that is dependent
      upon the valuation of FIS after an initial public offering or other
      liquidity event.

            The sale of the minority equity interest in FIS is expected to close
      in the first quarter of 2005, subject to certain conditions, including the
      receipt of Hart-Scott Rodino approval, any other required regulatory
      approvals and the closing of the credit facilities necessary to consummate
      the previously announced recapitalization of FIS.

            "The signing of this definitive stock purchase agreement is a
      significant milestone in our ongoing strategy of recognizing the embedded
      value of FIS," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William P. Foley,
      II. "This is clearly the first step of several that we will undertake in
      moving towards our goal of fully unlocking the value of FIS. We look
      forward to working with both Tom Lee and Texas Pacific Group in this
      process of both continuing to grow the FIS business and maximizing the
      value of the FIS asset for FNF stockholders."

            THL and TPG have registration rights, including the right to
      initiate a public offering of FIS common stock if one of two criteria is
      met. Both criteria relate to the potential price and gross proceeds that
      would be generated by a public offering of FIS. If FIS has not consummated
      a public offering of FIS common stock within two years of the closing of
      the minority equity interest sale, THL and TPG have various rights,
      including the ability to sell their shares of FIS common stock to either
      FNF or FIS. FNF will file the definitive stock purchase agreement with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission through a Form 8-K within four legal
      business days.
