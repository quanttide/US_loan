Board may deem advisable, provided however, no such amendment
shall be made without the approval of the Company&#146;s
stockholders to the extent such approval is required by law or
agreement or if such amendment would: (i)&nbsp;materially
increase the benefits accruing to the Participants;
(ii)&nbsp;increase the number of shares of Common Stock
available for issuance under the Amended and Restated Plan;
(iii)&nbsp;materially modify the requirements for eligibility to
participate in the Amended and Restated Plan; (iv)&nbsp;permit
the grant of any award at an exercise price or purchase price
below 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant; or
(v)&nbsp;allow for the modification of any outstanding award to
reduce the exercise price or the purchase price of such award
below 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant of such
award. The Board may alter or amend the Amended and Restated

Incentive Options or other types of options which give Optionees
more favorable tax treatment than that applicable to Options
granted under this Amended and Restated Plan as of the date of
its adoption. Upon any such alteration or amendment, any
outstanding Option granted hereunder may, if the Administrator
