<FONT size="2">The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain
the best available directors and employees for positions of
substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to
such directors and employees of the Company or any successor or
any parent or subsidiary of the Company which now exists or
hereafter is organized or acquired by or acquires the Company,
and to promote the success of the business of the Company.

may be granted under the Plan: options intended to qualify as
incentive stock options (&#147;incentive stock options&#148;)
under Section&nbsp;422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the &#147;Code&#148;); and other options not specifically
authorized or qualified for favorable income tax treatment by

    optionee, his guardian or legal representative. To the extent
    that an optionee has the right to exercise an option and
    purchase shares pursuant thereto, the option may be exercised
    from time to time by written notice to the Company stating the
    number of shares being purchased and accompanied by payment in
    full of the purchase price for such shares. If shares of stock
    are used in part or full payment for the shares to be acquired
    upon exercise of the option, such shares shall be valued for the
    purposes of such exchange at their fair market value as of the
    date of exercise of the option in accordance with the provisions
    of Paragraph&nbsp;6(b). Any certificates for shares of
    outstanding stock used to pay the purchase price shall be
    accompanied by a stock power duly endorsed in blank by the
    registered owner of the certificate (with the signature thereon
    guaranteed). If the certificate tendered by the optionee in such
    payment covers more shares than are required for such payment,
    the certificate shall also be accompanied by instructions from
    the optionee to the Company&#146;s transfer agent with respect
    to the disposition of the balance of the shares covered, thereby.

provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;6(k), without prior shareholder
approval. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary,
any provision of this Plan may be amended by the Board or
committee as required to obtain necessary approvals of
governmental agencies if (i)&nbsp;such change does not
materially alter the rights and interests of shareholders of the
Company and (ii)&nbsp;such change does not result in a failure
