<DIV align="left"><A NAME="000"></A></DIV>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement</B>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;16, 2004, the stockholders of Fidelity National Financial, Inc.
(the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;FNF&#148;) approved the Fidelity
National Financial, Inc. 2004 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the &#147;2004 Plan&#148;), pursuant to a proposal that was submitted to
the stockholders for approval at the Company&#146;s 2004 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Key terms of the 2004 Plan are as follows:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Administration. </I>The 2004 Plan will be administered by the Compensation
Committee or other committee selected by the Board, any of which we refer to as
the <I>committee</I>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Eligibility. </I>Employees, directors, consultants, and advisors of the Company and
its subsidiaries who are selected from time to time by the committee may be
granted awards under the 2004 Plan; provided, however, that only employees may
receive incentive stock options.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Awards. </I>The 2004 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
shares, performance units, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Shares Subject to the 2004 Plan. </I>The maximum number of shares that may be
delivered under the 2004 Plan is 12,500,000, plus the number of shares subject
to prior plan awards that are outstanding as of the effective date of the 2004
Plan and that are deemed not delivered under the prior plans because (i)&nbsp;the
shares are subject to a prior plan award that expires or is canceled,
forfeited, settled in cash, or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares;
(ii)&nbsp;the shares are held back, tendered or returned to cover the exercise price
or tax withholding obligations with respect to a prior plan award; or (iii)&nbsp;the
shares have been issued in connection with an award of restricted stock under a
prior plan that is canceled or forfeited prior to vesting or the award is
settled in cash, causing the shares to be returned to the Company. Shares
subject to awards granted under the 2004 Plan that are not delivered, held
back, tendered or returned for any of the reasons described in clauses (i),
(ii)&nbsp;or (iii)&nbsp;in the preceding sentence also will be available for future
grants. A &#147;prior plan&#148; is a plan of the Company or a subsidiary under which
stock options or other stock-based awards are outstanding as of the effective
date of the 2004 Plan, other than a stock-incentive plan assumed by the Company
in its acquisition of InterCept, Inc. (the &#147;InterCept Plans&#148;). No future
awards will be granted under the prior plans or the InterCept Plans.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2004 Plan in
connection with &#147;full-value awards&#148; ( <I>i.e., </I>awards other than (i)&nbsp;stock
options, (ii)&nbsp;stock appreciation rights or (iii)&nbsp;other awards for which the
participant pays the grant date intrinsic value) is 8,000,000 shares. If
settlement of a full-value award results in the delivery of shares in excess of
this limit, the aggregate number of shares available for awards other than
full-value awards will be reduced by 3 shares for each excess share delivered.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following limitations are applicable to awards that are intended to qualify
as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). The maximum number of
shares with respect to which performance-based options, stock appreciation
rights (or SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other stock-based awards may be granted under the 2004
Plan in any one fiscal year to any one participant shall be 4,000,000,
4,000,000, 2,000,000, 2,000,000, 2,000,000 and 2,000,000 shares, respectively.
The maximum performance-based compensation that can be paid pursuant to
performance units granted under the 2004 Plan in any one fiscal year to any one
participant shall be $25,000,000 or a number of shares having an aggregate fair
market value not in excess of such amount. The maximum performance-based
dividend or dividend equivalent that may be paid in any one fiscal year to any
one participant shall be $2,000,000. The committee retains the discretion to
grant awards that exceed these limits in situations where compliance with the
performance-based exception is not desired.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization,
liquidation, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, split-up, spin-off, share combination, share exchange, or any change in
corporate structure affecting the Company&#146;s common stock, the committee may, in
its discretion, adjust the number and kind of shares that may be delivered
under the 2004 Plan, the maximum number of shares or payments that may be
awarded to any one participant in any one fiscal year, the number and kind of
shares that are subject to outstanding awards, the exercise price, grant price
or other price of shares subject to outstanding awards, the performance
conditions relating to shares, the market price of shares, or per-share
results, and other terms and conditions of outstanding awards to prevent
dilution or enlargement of rights. In the event an extraordinary cash dividend
is made to the Company&#146;s stockholders, the committee may distribute cash to
holders of outstanding awards in lieu of making equitable adjustments to their
awards.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Change in Control. </I>The 2004 Plan provides that, except as otherwise provided in
a participant&#146;s award agreement, upon the occurrence of a change in control,
unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the rules
and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities
exchanges, any and all outstanding stock options and SARs granted under the
2004 Plan will become immediately exercisable, any restriction imposed on
restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other awards granted under the
2004 Plan will lapse, and any and all performance shares, performance units,
and other awards granted under the 2004 Plan with performance conditions will
be deemed earned at the target level, or, if no target level is specified, the
maximum level. The committee may, in its discretion, specify in a participant&#146;s
award agreement that outstanding stock options and SARs shall be automatically
cashed out upon a change in control.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For purposes of the 2004 Plan, &#147;change in control&#148; means (i)&nbsp;the acquisition,
directly or indirectly, by any person or group (within the meaning of Section
13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the beneficial
ownership of securities of the Company possessing more than fifty percent (50%)
of the total combined voting power of all outstanding securities of the
Company; (ii)&nbsp;a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the
surviving entity, except for a transaction in which the holders of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such merger
or consolidation hold, in the aggregate, securities possessing more than fifty
percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all outstanding voting
securities of the surviving entity immediately after such merger or
consolidation; (iii)&nbsp;a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving
entity but in which securities possessing more than fifty percent (50%) of the
total combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company
are transferred to or acquired by a person or persons different from the
persons holding those securities immediately prior to such merger; (iv)&nbsp;the
sale, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of related
transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (v)
the approval by the stockholders of a plan or proposal for the liquidation or
dissolution of the Company. The 2004 Plan provides that a spin-off of one or more subsidiaries or business units of the Company will not
constitute a change in control.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Repricings. </I>Stock options granted under the 2004 Plan may not be repriced.
Adjustments to the terms of stock options pursuant to the 2004 Plan&#146;s
adjustment provision (described above) made in connection with a merger,
reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, stock dividend,
extraordinary dividend or other event described in the adjustment provision
shall not constitute a repricing.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Additional information regarding the 2004 Plan can be found on pages 7 through
13 of our proxy statement filed on Schedule&nbsp;14A with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on November&nbsp;15, 2004.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following nonqualified stock options were granted, subject to stockholder
approval of the 2004 Plan, on October&nbsp;15, 2004 at an exercise price of $36.60
per share. The options have a maximum term of eight years and vest in thirds
with one-third vesting on each of October&nbsp;15, 2005, October&nbsp;15, 2006 and
October&nbsp;15, 2007. Each option grant was evidenced by an option agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;99.2:
