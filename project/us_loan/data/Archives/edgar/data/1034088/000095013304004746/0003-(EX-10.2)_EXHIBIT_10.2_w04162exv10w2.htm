<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">ECLIPSYS CORPORATION<BR>
<U>Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eclipsys Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), effective December&nbsp;20, 2004,
hereby grants to John A. Adams (the &#147;Optionee&#148;), an option to purchase a maximum of 400,000 shares
(the &#147;Option Shares&#148;) of its Common Stock, $.01 par value, at the price of $19.96 per share, on the
following terms and conditions:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Grant Contingency; Expiration of Option Offer</U>. This option grant contained herein
constitutes an offer by Corporation to provide Optionee with the Option Shares, and is subject to
and conditioned upon Optionee&#146;s acceptance of the Option Shares by returning to the Corporation an
executed original of this Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (the &#147;Option Agreement&#148;) along with
the Corporation&#146;s Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the &#147;Non-Compete Agreement&#148;) that
was provided to Optionee concurrently herewith. This offer shall be null and void and of no force
and effect, unless Optionee executes and returns to the Corporation both the Stock Option Agreement
and the Non-Compete Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Inducement Grant</U>. This option is granted as an &#147;inducement grant&#148; under Nasdaq
rules, and is therefore being granted outside the Corporation&#146;s equity incentive plans. However,
for convenience, reference is made in this option to certain provisions of the Corporation&#146;s
Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). Determinations made and definitions
used in connection with this option pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be governed by the
Plan as it exists on this date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Grant as Non Qualified Other Options</U>. This option is not intended to be an
incentive stock option under Section&nbsp;422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;Code&#148;). This option is in addition to any other options heretofore or hereafter granted to the
Optionee by the Corporation, but a duplicate original of this instrument shall not effect the grant
of another option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Extent of Option if Business Relationship Continues</U>. If the Optionee has continued
to serve the Corporation or any of the Corporation&#146;s present or future subsidiary corporations as
defined in Section 424(f) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder (a &#147;Related
Corporation&#148;) in the capacity of an employee or consultant (such service is described herein as
maintaining or being involved in a &#147;Business Relationship&#148; with the Corporation), the Optionee may
exercise this option for such percentage of the total Option Shares as is set forth opposite the
applicable date as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The foregoing rights are cumulative and, while the Optionee continues to maintain a Business
Relationship with the Corporation or any Related Corporation, may be exercised up to and including
the date, which is ten years from the date this option is granted. All of the foregoing rights are
subject to Sections&nbsp;5, 6 and 7, as appropriate, if the Optionee ceases to maintain a Business
Relationship with the Corporation or dies or becomes Disabled, as defined in the Employment
Agreement of even date between the Corporation and Optionee (the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;), while
employed by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)&nbsp;this Option may become immediately
exercisable in full under certain circumstances following an acquisition or change of control to
the extent such acceleration is provided in Section 6(d) of the Employment Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;in
the event the employment of the Participant is terminated under circumstances described in Section
6(a) of the Employment Agreement, the vested portion of this Option shall be determined as if such
employment termination occurred one year later.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Termination of Business Relationship.</U> If the Optionee ceases to maintain a
Business Relationship with the Corporation, other than by reason of death, disability as defined in
the Employment Agreement, or termination for Cause as defined in the Employment Agreement, no
further installments of this option shall become exercisable (except to the extent set forth in the
second clause of the proviso in the last sentence of Section&nbsp;4) and this option shall terminate
after the passage of ninety (90)&nbsp;days from the date the Business Relationship ceases, but in no
event later than the scheduled expiration date. In such a case, the Optionee&#146;s only rights
hereunder shall be those which are properly exercised before the termination of this option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U>Death; Disability</U>. If the Optionee is a natural person who dies while involved in
a Business Relationship with the Corporation, this option may be exercised, to the extent otherwise
exercisable on the date of his death, by his estate, personal representative or beneficiary to whom
this option has been assigned pursuant to Section&nbsp;10, at any time within 180&nbsp;days after the date of
death, but not later than the scheduled expiration date. If the Optionee is a natural person whose
Business Relationship with the Corporation is terminated by reason of his Disability (as defined in
the Employment Agreement), this option may be exercised, to the extent otherwise exercisable on the
date the Business Relationship was terminated, at any time within 180&nbsp;days after the date of such
termination, but not later than the scheduled expiration date. At the expiration of such 180-day
period or the scheduled expiration date, whichever is the earlier, this option

exercised before such termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>No Exercise of Option if Business Relationship Terminated for Cause</U>. If the
Business Relationship of the Optionee with the Corporation is terminated for Cause, as defined in
the Employment Agreement, this option shall terminate on the date of such termination and this
option shall thereupon not be exercisable to any extent whatsoever.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>Partial Exercise</U>. Exercise of this option up to the extent above stated may be
made in part at any time and from time to time within the above limits, except that this option may
not be exercised for a fraction of a share unless such exercise is with respect to the final
installment of stock subject to this option and a fractional share (or cash in lieu thereof) must
be issued to permit the Optionee to exercise completely such final installment. Any fractional
share with respect to which an installment of this option cannot be exercised because of the
limitation contained in the preceding sentence shall remain subject to this option and shall be
available for later purchase by the Optionee in accordance with the terms hereof.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<U>Method of Exercising Option</U>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, this option may be exercised by written notice to the Corporation, at the principal
executive office of the Corporation, or to such transfer agent as the Corporation shall designate.
Such notice shall state the election to exercise this option and the number of shares for which it
is being exercised and shall be signed by the person or persons so exercising this option. Such
notice shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price of such shares, and the
Corporation shall deliver a certificate or certificates representing such shares as soon as
practicable after the notice shall be received. Such certificate or certificates shall be
registered in the name of the person or persons so exercising this option (or, if this option shall
be exercised by the Optionee and if the Optionee shall so request in the notice exercising this
option, shall be registered in the name of the Optionee and another person jointly, with right of
survivorship) and shall be delivered as provided above to or upon the written order of the person
or persons exercising this option. In the event this option shall be exercised, pursuant to
Section&nbsp;6 hereof, by any person or persons other than the Optionee, such notice shall be
accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise this option.
All shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of this option as provided herein shall be
fully paid and non-assessable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;<U>Option Not Transferable</U>. This option is not transferable or assignable except by
the laws of descent and distribution. Only the Optionee can exercise this option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;<U>No Obligation to Exercise Option</U>. The grant and acceptance of this option imposes
no obligation on the Optionee to exercise it.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;<U>No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship</U>. The Corporation and any Related
Corporations are not by this option obligated to continue to maintain a business relationship with
the Optionee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;<U>No Rights as Stockholder until Exercise</U>. The Optionee shall have no rights as a
stockholder with respect to the Option Shares until a stock certificate therefor has been issued to
the Optionee and is fully paid for in accordance with Section&nbsp;9. Except as is expressly provided
in the Plan for options granted thereunder with respect to certain changes in the capitalization of
the Corporation, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or similar rights for which the record
date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;<U>Capital Changes and Business Successions</U>. It is the purpose of this option to
encourage the Optionee to work for the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders.
Since, for example, that might require the issuance of a stock dividend or a merger with another
corporation, the purpose of this option would not be served if such a stock dividend, merger or
similar occurrence would cause the Optionee&#146;s rights hereunder to be diluted or terminated and thus
be contrary to the Optionee&#146;s interest. The Plan contains extensive provisions designed to
preserve options at full value in a number of contingencies. Therefore, provisions in the Plan for
adjustment with respect to stock

were granted under the Plan.

discretion determines that it is obligated to withhold any tax in connection with the exercise of
this option, or in connection with the transfer of, or the lapse of restrictions on, any Common
Stock or other property acquired pursuant to this option, the Optionee hereby agrees that the
Corporation or Related Corporation may withhold from the Optionee&#146;s wages or other remuneration the
appropriate amount of tax. At the discretion of the Corporation or Related Corporation, the amount
required to be withheld may be withheld in cash from such wages or other remuneration, or in kind
from the Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Optionee on exercise of this option. The
Optionee further agrees that, if the Corporation or Related Corporation does not withhold an amount
from the Optionee&#146;s wages or other remuneration sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation of
the Corporation or Related Corporation, the Optionee will reimburse the Corporation or Related
Corporation on demand, in cash, for the amount underwithheld.
