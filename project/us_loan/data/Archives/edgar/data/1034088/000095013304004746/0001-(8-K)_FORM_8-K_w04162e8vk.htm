<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01.&nbsp;Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, the Registrant entered into an employment agreement with John A.
Adams, the Registrant&#146;s Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Pursuant to
this agreement, the Registrant agrees to employ Mr.&nbsp;Adams as Executive Vice President and Chief
Administrative Officer at an initial annual salary of $450,000. Mr.&nbsp;Adams will participate in the
Registrant&#146;s executive bonus plan, with an initial target bonus of at least $200,000 for 2005, of
which $100,000 is guaranteed. Mr.&nbsp;Adams also receives (i)&nbsp;a one-time signing bonus of $140,000;
(ii)&nbsp;an option grant of 400,000 shares of the Registrant&#146;s common stock; and (iii)&nbsp;a restricted
stock grant of 100,000 shares of the Registrant&#146;s common stock . The terms of the agreements
regarding the option grant and restricted stock grant are described below. Pursuant to the
employment agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Adams shall remain employed by Registrant until his employment is
terminated by either Registrant or Mr.&nbsp;Adams. If Mr.&nbsp;Adams&#146; employment is terminated by the
Registrant without cause or by Mr.&nbsp;Adams for good reason (each as defined in the agreement), the
Registrant must provide to Mr.&nbsp;Adams payment equal to his base salary for 18&nbsp;months, a bonus equal
to 150% of his target bonus on the date of termination, an additional 12&nbsp;months of vesting of stock
and options granted to him (to the extent the relevant option or stock grant agreement does not
already provide a similar benefit) and continuation of life, health and dental benefits for 18
months (or until such time as Mr.&nbsp;Adams is covered by a similar program of another employer). If
Mr.&nbsp;Adams&#146; employment is terminated by the Registrant or its successor without cause or by Mr.
Adams for good reason within two years following a change in control of the Registrant, the
Registrant must pay Mr.&nbsp;Adams his base salary for 24&nbsp;months and a bonus equal to 200% of his target
bonus on the date of termination, and provide him with full vesting of all restricted stock awards
and option grants and continuation of life, health and dental benefits for an additional 24&nbsp;months
or until such time as Mr.&nbsp;Adams is covered by a similar program of another employer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, on December&nbsp;20, 2004, the Registrant entered into a non-qualified stock option
agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Adams. This option was granted without stockholder approval as an inducement
grant in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4350. Pursuant to this agreement, the Registrant
granted Mr.&nbsp;Adams an option to purchase up to 400,000 shares of the common stock of the Registrant
at a purchase price of $19.96 per share. This option vests over a five-year period, with 20%
vesting on December&nbsp;20, 2005 and monthly thereafter at the rate of 1.667% per month until December
20, 2009, provided that Mr.&nbsp;Adams remains employed by the Registrant at the end of each such
period. The option terminates 90&nbsp;days after the termination of the relationship between Mr.&nbsp;Adams
and the Registrant, unless the termination is for cause (in which case the option may not be
exercised) or is a result of the death or disability of Mr.&nbsp;Adams (in which case the option
terminates 180&nbsp;days after the date of termination). Unless exercised or terminated earlier, the
option expires after 10&nbsp;years from the date of grant. In the event Mr.&nbsp;Adams&#146;s employment is
terminated by the Registrant without cause or by Mr.&nbsp;Adams for good reason, the vesting schedule of
the options will accelerate by 12&nbsp;months. Further, as provided in the employment agreement, in the
event Mr.&nbsp;Adams&#146;s employment is terminated by the Registrant or its successor without cause or by
Mr.&nbsp;Adams for good reason within two years following a change in control of the Registrant, the
options will immediately vest in full.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on December&nbsp;20, 2004, the Registrant entered into a restricted stock agreement with Mr.
Adams. This restricted stock award was made without stockholder approval as an inducement grant in
accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4350. Pursuant to this agreement, the Registrant granted
Mr.&nbsp;Adams the right to purchase 100,000 shares of the common stock of the Registrant at a purchase
price of $0.01 per share. The Registrant maintains the right to repurchase the unvested portion of
these shares at the original purchase price upon the termination of the relationship between the
Registrant and Mr.&nbsp;Adams. The shares vest over a five-year period, with 20% vesting on December
20, 2005 and 1.667%

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">vesting each month thereafter until December&nbsp;20, 2009, provided that Mr.&nbsp;Adams remains
employed by the Registrant at the end of each such period. In the event Mr.&nbsp;Adams&#146; employment is
terminated by the Registrant without cause or by Mr.&nbsp;Adams for good reason, the vesting schedule
for the shares will accelerate by 12&nbsp;months. Further, as provided in the employment agreement, in
the event Mr.&nbsp;Adams&#146;employment is terminated by the Registrant or its successor without cause or by
Mr.&nbsp;Adams for good reason within two years following a change in control of the Registrant, the
shares will immediately vest in full.

and Chief Administrative Officer. Mr.&nbsp;Adams is 49&nbsp;years old. Prior to joining Eclipsys, Mr.&nbsp;Adams
served as the Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Exult,
Inc., a human resources outsourcing company, from June&nbsp;2003 until December&nbsp;2004. Prior to joining
Exult, Mr.&nbsp;Adams served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for AT&#038;T Corp.&#146;s Business
Services division from October&nbsp;2000 to June&nbsp;2003. From May&nbsp;1985 to October&nbsp;2000, Mr.&nbsp;Adams served
in a number of roles with Electronic Data Systems Corporation, including most recently as Vice
President and Corporate Controller. See Item&nbsp;1.01(a)(i) for a description of the material terms of
the employment agreement between the Registrant and Mr.&nbsp;Adams.
