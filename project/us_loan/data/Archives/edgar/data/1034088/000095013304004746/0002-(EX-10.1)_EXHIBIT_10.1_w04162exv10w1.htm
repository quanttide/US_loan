    <TD><U>Disability</U>. In the event that the Executive suffers a Disability, the Company
may, in its discretion, terminate the Executive&#146;s employment hereunder. For purposes of
this Agreement, &#147;<U>Disability</U>&#148; shall be defined to occur at such time as the Executive
becomes eligible to receive benefits under the terms of the Company&#146;s then applicable
long-term disability policy, or, in the absence of such policy, shall be defined as a
physical or mental disability that prevents the Executive from performing his duties under
this Agreement for ninety (90)&nbsp;consecutive days or more, or for an aggregate of one hundred
twenty (120)&nbsp;days in any period of twelve (12)&nbsp;months. The Company may only terminate the
Executive on account of Disability after giving due consideration to whether reasonable
accommodations can be made under which the Executive is able to fulfill his duties under
this Agreement. The commencement date and expected duration of any physical or mental
condition that prevents the Executive from performing his duties hereunder shall be
determined by a medical doctor mutually acceptable to the Executive and the Company. In
the event the Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by the Company pursuant to this Section
6(e), then the Company shall pay the Executive the Accrued Amounts in a lump sum within ten
(10)&nbsp;days of termination of employment. In addition, to the extent not included in the
Accrued Amounts, the Executive shall receive a pro rata bonus for the bonus period during
which the date of termination pursuant to this Section 6(e) occurs calculated at one
hundred percent (100%) of the Target Bonus then in effect, multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days that the Executive was employed during such bonus
term and the denominator of which is 365. Such prorated bonus shall be paid in accordance
with the Company&#146;s customary
practices for payment of executive bonuses but with no additional performance
requirements or contingencies, provided, however, that to the extent that this
Employment Agreement is treated as a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement
under Section&nbsp;409A, the payment of such bonus may not be accelerated by either the
Company or the Executive unless such acceleration does not trigger the application of
interest and penalty taxes under Section&nbsp;409A.</TD>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This GENERAL RELEASE is made and entered into by and between Eclipsys Corporation and its
affiliated, direct and indirect subsidiary corporations and each of such corporations&#146; employees,
officers, and Board of Directors (individually and collectively &#147;Eclipsys&#148;) and John A. Adams,
&#091;CURRENT ADDRESS&#093; (&#147;you&#148;, &#147;your&#148; or &#147;Adams&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>WITNESSETH</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, you and Eclipsys are party to an Employment Agreement dated as of December ___, 2004
(the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Employment Agreement contemplates that you will be paid certain severance
benefits specified therein under specified circumstances, provided that you execute this General
Release;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, your termination from your position as &#091;TITLE&#093; of Eclipsys will be effective &#091;date&#093;;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Eclipsys and you desire to settle fully and finally any and all differences between
ourselves including, but in no way limited to, differences arising out of your employment and
circumstances giving rise to your departure from Eclipsys;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual promises herein contained and
Eclipsys&#146; agreement to provide you with certain severance benefits pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, Eclipsys and you agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST: You acknowledge that Eclipsys&#146; execution of this General Release and its compliance
with terms herein shall not in any way be construed as an admission by Eclipsys, of any acts of
discrimination or improper or unlawful treatment of you. Eclipsys has entered into this General
Release to avoid the potential expenses and inconvenience of litigation, and specifically disclaims
any liability to or discrimination against you on the part of Eclipsys.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECOND: You represent and agree that your employment with Eclipsys will be terminated
effective &#091;DATE&#093;, and that you are eligible for reemployment only by mutual agreement and consent
of yourself and Eclipsys in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIRD: Unless otherwise required by law, Eclipsys agrees in the future to articulate that the
reason for your termination was the pursuit of other interests. Eclipsys further agrees that any
inquiry about your employment will be referred to a representative of the Human Resources

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Department, who will state the reasons for your termination as articulated in the preceding
sentence. However, it is understood that you may direct inquiries regarding personal references to
other employees of Eclipsys, but it is further understood that Eclipsys will not be liable for
reference information provided by such persons.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOURTH: You understand, acknowledge and agree that, under the stock option agreements that
you signed with Eclipsys, and subject to specified conditions, you have a specified period from
the day of the termination of your employment to exercise any stock option awards that you received
from Eclipsys and that are vested as of the date of termination. Because you will not be an
employee of Eclipsys from and after your termination, you acknowledge and agree to retain separate
counsel and/or advice regarding whether you hold &#147;material non-public information&#148; regarding
Eclipsys and whether it is legal, permissible or in your best interest for you to exercise your
stock options and sell Eclipsys stock under the applicable laws, rules ore regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any other applicable Federal or state laws. Eclipsys is not,
nor will be, responsible for any decisions that you make.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIFTH: You represent and warrant that you have not filed any lawsuit, complaint or charge
against Eclipsys, with any local, state, or federal agency or court of whatever jurisdiction, that
you will not do so at any time hereafter, and that if any agency or court were to assume
jurisdiction on your behalf for any such complaint or charge against Eclipsys, or any of them, you
would request such agency or court to withdraw from the matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIXTH: You represent that you have not filed any complaints or charges against Eclipsys with
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or with any other local, state or federal agency or
court, that you will not do so at any time hereafter, and that if any such agency or court assumes
jurisdiction of any complaint or charge against Eclipsys on behalf of you, you will request such
agency or court to withdraw from the matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEVENTH: As a material inducement to Eclipsys to enter into the General Release and to
provide you the severance benefits provided in the Employment Agreement, you hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally release, acquit, and forever discharge Eclipsys, and its predecessors, successors,
assigns and any persons acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them (Releasees) from
any and all charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises or any other cause of
action of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, which you now have, own, or hold, or claim to
have had, owned, or held, or which you at any time heretofore had, owned, or held against each or
any of the Releasees.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Further, you expressly waive and relinquish all rights, claims and benefits afforded you by Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended, and the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA)&nbsp;as amended, and do so understanding and acknowledging the

the ADEA (as applicable); provided, however, that this General Release does not release Eclipsys
from its obligations to you as set-forth herein or in the Employment Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIGHTH: You are hereby informed that you have twenty-one (21)&nbsp;calendar days to consider the
terms of this General Release and you are encouraged to discuss the terms with an attorney of your
choice. The twenty-one calendar days shall expire on &#091;DATE&#093; and, in addition, you understand that
this General Release may be revoked within seven (7)&nbsp;days of the signing date set forth below. In
the event you do not execute this General Release or you subsequently revoke it within the
seven-day period specified above, you agree that Eclipsys shall not be obligated to provide
severance benefits to you under the Employment Agreement or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NINTH: As further consideration and material inducement for Eclipsys to enter into this
Agreement, you agree not to disclose, orally or in writing, to any person, corporation, firm,
business, entity, court or governmental authority (a)&nbsp;the terms and provisions of this Agreement
including, but not limited to, the amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement; (b)&nbsp;any documents,
files, records, or any other information related to this Agreement; or (c)&nbsp;the claims asserted in
this case, without the prior written consent of Eclipsys or its successors or assigns. In the event
that you are subpoenaed to provide testimony concerning matters that are of a confidential nature
regarding Eclipsys, you agree to provide Eclipsys with prompt notice of such subpoena or request,
and Eclipsys agrees that you will not be in breach of this Agreement by providing such testimony if
legally required to do so, provided that you have provided prompt notice to Eclipsys as set-forth
above. You also agree that you will not make any unfavorable, disparaging, or negative comment,
remark or statement, whether written or oral, about Eclipsys, any of its affiliates, or any of
their respective offices, directors, or employees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TENTH: You acknowledge that you signed one or more confidentiality agreements while at
Eclipsys that govern your use of Eclipsys&#146; confidential, proprietary and trade secret information.
You agree that after your departure from Eclipsys, you will maintain and preserve the
confidentiality of such information and that, among other things, you will abide by and honor the
terms of such agreements which, by their terms, remain in full force and effect following the
termination of your employment with Eclipsys.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELEVENTH: It is the desire of the parties that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, or if compliance with any provision is restrained
pending a final determination as to its legality, such deletion or restraint will apply only to the
operation of the provisions deemed invalid, unenforceable or restrained. To the extent any
provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable or restrained, the remaining agreement
provisions will be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent possible.
