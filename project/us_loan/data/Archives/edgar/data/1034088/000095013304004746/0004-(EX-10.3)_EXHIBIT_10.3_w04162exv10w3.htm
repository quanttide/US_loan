In the event Participant is eligible for Change of Control benefits under Section 6(d) of the

Company at its principal offices the certificate or certificates representing the Shares which the
Company has elected to purchase, duly endorsed in blank by the Participant or with duly elected

transfer to the Company pursuant to subsection (b)&nbsp;above, the Company shall not pay any dividend to
the Participant on account of such Shares or permit the Participant to exercise any of the
privileges or rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, but shall, in so far as
permitted by law, treat the Company as the owner of such Shares.
