<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>I agree with the statements made in
&#147;Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant&#146;s Certifying Accountant&#148; in the report on
Form 8-K of Kolorfusion International, Inc. (the &#147;8-K Report&#148;), as reprinted
below from the 8-K Report: </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;Item 4.01 Changes
in Registrant&#146;s Certifying Accountant </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 19, 2004, the Board of
Directors of Kolorfusion International Inc., a Colorado corporation (the
&#147;Company&#148;), approved and authorized the termination of the services of Virchow,
Krause &amp; Company, LLP (&#147;VK&amp;Co.&#148;) as principal independent accountant for
the Company. The termination of the services of VK&amp;Co. was a result of communication
between the Company and VK&amp;Co. and the subsequent decision by the Board of Directors
of the Company that it would be in the best interests of the Company to effect a change in
auditors in order to address the needs of a small business development company. During the
Company&#146;s two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period preceding
the resignation of VK&amp;Co., there were no disagreements with VK&amp;Co. which were not
resolved on any matter concerning accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of VK&amp;Co., would have caused VK&amp;Co. to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports. The report of VK&amp;Co. for
fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 indicated the following: </FONT></P>

&#147;The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern. As discuss in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
Company&#146;s current liabilities exceeded its current assets as of June 30, 2004. This
raises substantial about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management&#146;s plans regarding these matters also are described in Note 1. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.&#148; </FONT></TD>

immediately preceding paragraph, the report of VK&amp;Co. did not contain an adverse
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope, or accounting principles. </FONT></P>
