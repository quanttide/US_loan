<B>Net1 UEPS Technologies, Inc (&#8220;Net1&#8221;) Announces Extension of Contract with KwaZulu Natal Provincial Government</B></P>
<P align="justify"> Net1 today announced that its contract with the KwaZulu Natal
  provincial government for the distribution of social welfare grants has been
  extended by one year, until 31 December 2005, with a further option to extend
  the contract to 31 December 2006.</P>
<P align="justify"> Net1 utilises its smart card based UEPS technology to distribute
  approximately 1.46 million social welfare grants with a value of ZAR 870 million
  (US&#36; 152 million) per month in KwaZulu Natal. The grants distributed include
  old age grants, disability grants and child support grants. </P>
<P align="justify"> &#8220;We are delighted to continue our long standing relationship
  with the KwaZulu Natal government&#8221;, said Serge Belamant, Chairman and
  Chief Executive Officer of Net1. &#8220;We are proud that our UEPS delivery
  platform will continue to improve the lifestyles of our cardholders in KwaZulu
  Natal and provide them with a safe, secure transacting instrument which allows
  them access to goods and financial services which were previously unattainable.&#8221;</P>
<P> <B>About Net1</B> (<U><FONT color="#0000ff">www.net1ueps.com</FONT></U>) <br>
  Net1 is a provider of technologies and systems that create a secure and affordable
  transacting channel between formal businesses and the &#8220;un-banked&#8221;
  and &#8220;under-banked&#8221; populations of developing countries who have
  no or limited access to traditional banking facilities. Net1 has developed the
  Universal Electronic Payment System (&#8220;UEPS&#8221;) that utilizes smart
  card technology to provide a fully integrated payment, switching and settlement
  system suitable for multiple applications and services meeting the requirements
  of the un-banked and under-banked populations. The company, through its subsidiaries,
  employs the UEPS to add efficiency to a myriad of commercial activities that
  involve banking and payment systems, money transfers and other electronic data
  applications. The company&#8217;s payment system enables its customers to effect
  transactions &#8220;off-line&#8221; in underdeveloped areas where traditional
  financial institutions and their services have limited penetration or are otherwise
  unavailable due to the lack of, or limited branch, Automated Teller Machines
  (or &#8220;ATM&#8221;), Point Of Sale, support and communications infrastructures.</P>
<P align="justify"> This announcement may contain forward-looking statements pursuant
  to the &#8220;safe-harbor&#8221; provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
  Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
  such as product demand, market and customer acceptance, the effect of economic
  conditions, competition, pricing, development difficulties, foreign currency
  risks, costs of capital, the ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions,
  and other risks detailed in the company&#8217;s SEC filings, including, but
  not limited to, our most recent report on Form 8-K. The company undertakes no
  obligation to revise any of these statements to reflect future circumstances
  or the occurrence of unanticipated events. </P>
