<P> <B>About Net1</B> (<U><FONT color="#0000ff">www.net1ueps.com</FONT></U>) <br>
  Net1 is a provider of technologies and systems that create a secure and affordable
  transacting channel between formal businesses and the &#8220;un-banked&#8221;
  and &#8220;under-banked&#8221; populations of developing countries who have
  no or limited access to traditional banking facilities. Net1 has developed the
  Universal Electronic Payment System (&#8220;UEPS&#8221;) that utilizes smart
  card technology to provide a fully integrated payment, switching and settlement
  system suitable for multiple applications and services meeting the requirements
  of the un-banked and under-banked populations. The company, through its subsidiaries,
  employs the UEPS to add efficiency to a myriad of commercial activities that
  involve banking and payment systems, money transfers and other electronic data
  applications. The company&#8217;s payment system enables its customers to effect
  transactions &#8220;off-line&#8221; in underdeveloped areas where traditional
  financial institutions and their services have limited penetration or are otherwise
  unavailable due to the lack of, or limited branch, Automated Teller Machines
  (or &#8220;ATM&#8221;), Point Of Sale, support and communications infrastructures.</P>
