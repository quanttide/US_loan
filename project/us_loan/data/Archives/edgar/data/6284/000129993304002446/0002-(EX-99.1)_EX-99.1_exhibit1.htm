<P align="left" style="font-size: 14pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt">PEABODY, MA (December&nbsp;23, 2004) &#150; Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOGE), a designer and
manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced that, as expected,
it has received a NASDAQ staff determination letter indicating that Analogic is not in compliance
with the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4310(c)(14)
as a result of its failure to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October&nbsp;31, 2004, with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The NASDAQ Stock Market also indicated that the NASDAQ
Listing Qualifications Panel will consider the Company&#146;s failure to file its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October&nbsp;31, 2004 with the SEC in rendering a determination
regarding the Company&#146;s continued listing on The NASDAQ National Market.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Analogic has previously reported that, in the course of preparing its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, Analogic further evaluated certain information leading it
to question whether appropriate software revenue recognition procedures had been followed in all
cases by its Camtronics Medical Systems subsidiary, a supplier of advanced cardiac information
management systems. Analogic has been conducting a review of Camtronics transactions and the
revenue recognition procedures followed. This review has led to a delay in the completion of
Analogic&#146;s financial statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 and for the quarter ended
October&nbsp;31, 2004. Those financial statements have not yet been completed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Due to this review and the resultant delay in the completion of its financial statements, Analogic
did not file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October&nbsp;31, 2004, by the
December&nbsp;10, 2004 due date. Analogic has filed a Form&nbsp;12b-25 (Notification of Late Filing) with the
SEC reporting this filing delinquency.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Analogic announced on November&nbsp;2, 2004 that it had received a notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market
that Analogic was not in compliance with the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing as a result
of its failure to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 with the SEC, and that its
common stock is therefore subject to delisting from The NASDAQ National Market. As permitted by
NASDAQ rules, Analogic appealed the decision to delist its common stock; its common stock will
remain listed on the NASDAQ National Market pending the outcome of that appeal. As part of the
appeal, Analogic requested an extension until January&nbsp;31, 2005 to file both its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October&nbsp;31,
2004. A hearing on that appeal was held before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel on December&nbsp;9,
2004, but a decision has not yet been rendered. Analogic can provide no assurances that the NASDAQ
Listing Qualifications Panel will grant Analogic&#146;s request for the filing extension. Analogic is
working diligently to complete the preparation of its financial statements for fiscal 2004 and the
quarter ended October&nbsp;31, 2004 and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q as promptly as possible. If its request for an extension until January&nbsp;31, 2005 is
granted, Analogic believes that it will be able to complete and file those reports by that date.
