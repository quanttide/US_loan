ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

           On December 22, 2004, TXU Corp. amended its $500 million five-year
revolving credit facility with LOC 2003 Trust, a special purpose, wholly-owned
subsidiary of TXU Corp. ("LOC Trust"). On that date, LOC Trust, in turn, amended
its $500 million five-year revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse First
Boston, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and Citibank, N.A. (the "Lenders"). Each
facility (together, the "Facility") was amended and restated primarily to
effectuate the following amendments. First, the amendment reduced the total
commitment of the Lenders under the Facility from $500 million to $425 million,
which amount represents the total amount currently outstanding under the
Facility. This amount is represented by $425 million of letters of credit. Also,
amounts repaid under the Facility can not be re-borrowed, and the amount and
maturity of any outstanding letter of credit can not be increased or extended,
respectively. Next, the amendment modified the maturity of the Facility from
July 15, 2008 to December 31, 2005. In addition, upon the signing of the
original Facility, TXU Corp. capitalized LOC Trust with approximately $525
million of cash, which LOC Trust used to collateralize its obligations to the
Lenders under the Facility. The amendment allowed for the release of the $525
million cash collateral to LOC Trust, which, in turn, released the same to TXU
Corp. TXU Corp. received the cash collateral on December 23, 2004 and intends to
use the cash for general corporate purposes. However, if the facility is not
repaid and terminated by January 14, 2005, then LOC Trust, and, in turn, TXU
Corp. must immediately reinstate the collateral. The obligation to reinstate the
collateral may be satisfied by the posting of cash or one or more letters of
credit issued under one of TXU Corp.'s subsidiaries' credit facilities. In light
of the reduction in the overall commitment, only approximately $450 million of
collateral would need to be posted if required. TXU Corp. currently expects that
it will repay and terminate the Facility on or before January 14, 2005.

           Under the terms of the amended Facility, TXU Corp. has agreed to pay,
through LOC Trust, the Lenders a Facility fee on a quarterly basis. The amount
of the fee is dependant upon whether or not the Facility is collateralized. If
the Facility is not collateralized, the amount of the fee will be equal to 1.0%
of the daily average face amounts of all outstanding letters of credit, and if
the Facility is collateralized then the fee will be equal to 0.15% of the daily
average face amounts of all outstanding letters of credit.

           The Facility matures on December 31, 2005, at which time all
outstanding amounts under the Facility will be due and payable. The amended and
restated Facility contains usual and customary covenants for credit facilities
of this type, including covenants limiting liens, mergers and substantial asset
sales or acquisitions. The Facility provides that TXU Corp. shall have
maintained an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (as defined in the Facility)) to interest expenses ratio as of the
end of each fiscal quarter for the prior twelve months of no less than 2.00 to
1.00 and a consolidated senior debt (as defined in the Facility) to EBITDA as of
the end of each fiscal quarter for the prior twelve months of to no more than
6.25 to 1.00.

           TXU Corp. has or may have had customary banking relationships with
each of the Lenders based on the provision of a variety of financial services,
including investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking and
other advisory services. None of these services are material to TXU Corp.
individually or in the aggregate with respect to any individual Lender.

           The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Facility is not
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual amended and
restated credit agreements, which are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto
and are hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

           The information described in Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated
by reference into this Item 2.03.

     SECTION 2.01. COMMITMENTS.

     Each LC Bank has prior to the Restatement Date issued Letters of Credit for
the account of the Borrower in the amounts and with the expiration dates
specified on Schedule 2. Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon
the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees,

obligations in respect of drawings under such Letters of Credit, as required
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or as permitted pursuant to Sections 2.02(d) and
2.03, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed
such Lender's Commitment. Once repaid hereunder, Loans may not be reborrowed,
other than pursuant to Section 2.02(d), and no Letter of Credit may be extended
or may be modified to increase the stated amount thereof.

     SECTION 2.02. LOANS.

     (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Percentages;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in
itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being
understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). Each
Loan shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.03.
The Loan or Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal
amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000
(or an aggregate principal amount at least equal to (x) the remaining balance of
the available Commitments or (y) the amount of the Borrower's reimbursement
obligations being financed or refinanced thereby).

     (b) Each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of Eurodollar Loans or ABR
Loans (except as otherwise required by Section 2.13(a)(i)), as the Borrower may
request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any
Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at
the same time, but no more than seven Eurodollar Borrowings may be outstanding
at any time.

     (c) If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have made its portion of
any Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the
Borrower (without waiving any claim against such Lender for such Lender's
failure to make such portion available) severally agree to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at
(i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the
Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and at the Alternate Base Rate,
thereafter. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such


<PAGE>
                                                                              10


corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of
such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

     (d) The Borrower may refinance all or any part of any Borrowing with a
Borrowing of the same or a different Type, subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in this Agreement. Any Borrowing or part thereof so
refinanced shall be deemed to be repaid or prepaid in accordance with Section
2.06 or 2.11, as applicable, with the proceeds of a new Borrowing, and the
proceeds of the new Borrowing, to the extent they do not exceed the principal
amount of the Borrowing being refinanced, shall not be paid by the Lenders to
the Administrative Agent or by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant
to subsection (c) above.

     SECTION 2.03. BORROWING PROCEDURE.

     In order to request a Borrowing to refinance Loans made under Section
2.04(b) or to refinance any such Borrowing, the Borrower shall provide the
Administrative Agent, via hand delivery, telecopy or telephone (promptly
confirmed via telecopy), a duly completed Borrowing Request in the form of
Exhibit A (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before such Borrowing, and (b) in the
case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one
Business Day before such Borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
in each case specify (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a
Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which
shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof; and (iii) if such Borrowing is
to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto, which
shall not end after the Maturity Date. If no election as to the Type of
Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be
an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing
is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration (subject to the limitations
set forth in the definition of "Interest Period"). If the Borrower shall not
have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.03 of its election to
refinance a Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing, then the Borrower shall (unless such Borrowing is repaid at the end
of such Interest Period) be deemed to have given notice of an election to
refinance such Borrowing with an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Borrowing shall be requested if
the Interest Period with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given
pursuant to this Section 2.03 and of each Lender's portion of the requested
Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.04. LETTERS OF CREDIT

     (a) The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to each LC Bank on each date on which
such LC Bank shall pay any amount under any Letter of Credit issued by such LC
Bank a sum equal to the amount so paid plus interest on such amount from the
date so paid by such LC Bank until repayment to such LC Bank in full at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate. If and to
the extent that (x) any Lender shall have funded its participation pursuant to
subsection (b) below in any reimbursement obligation of the Borrower under this
subsection (a) and (y) the amount paid by such Lender to fund such participation
shall constitute an ABR Loan pursuant to subsection (b) below, then the


<PAGE>
                                                                              11


corresponding reimbursement obligation of the Borrower to the LC Bank under this
subsection (a) shall be deemed to be satisfied.

     (b) Each LC Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby
acquires from each LC Bank, a participation in each Letter of Credit issued by
such LC Bank equal to such Lender's Percentage of the stated amount of such
Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, if any
LC Bank shall not have been reimbursed in full by the Borrower for any payment
made by such LC Bank under a Letter of Credit on the date of such payment, such
LC Bank shall give the Administrative Agent and each Lender prompt notice
thereof (an "LC PAYMENT NOTICE") no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time)
on the Business Day immediately succeeding the date of such payment by such LC
Bank. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Lender severally agrees to fund its participation in the reimbursement
obligation of the Borrower to each LC Bank by paying to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such LC Bank an amount equal to such Lender's Percentage of
such unreimbursed amount paid by such LC Bank, plus interest on such amount at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date of the
payment by such LC Bank to the date of payment to such LC Bank by such Lender.
Each such payment by a Lender shall be made not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the later to occur of (i) the Business Day immediately following
the date of such payment by such LC Bank and (ii) the Business Day on which the
Lender shall have received an LC Payment Notice from such LC Bank. Each Lender's
obligation to make each such payment to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each LC Bank shall be several and shall not be affected by the occurrence or
continuance of a Default or Event of Default or the failure of any other Lender
to make any payment under this subsection (b). Each Lender further agrees that
each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
reduction whatsoever. If at any time prior to the Maturity Date any Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent any amount pursuant to this subsection (b) for
the account of any LC Bank in respect of the reimbursement obligations of the
Borrower in respect of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, such amount so
paid in respect of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligations shall,
until repaid or refinanced as part of a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to Section
2.02(d), constitute an ABR Loan made by such Lender for all purposes of this
Agreement, and all such ABR Loans made by the Lenders in respect of such
reimbursement obligations shall constitute an ABR Borrowing for all purposes of
this Agreement.

     (c) The failure of any Lender to make any payment to the Administrative
Agent for the account of any LC Bank in accordance with subsection (b) above
shall not relieve any other Lender of its own obligation to make any similar
payment to the Administrative Agent, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make any such payment. If any Lender (a
"NON-PERFORMING LENDER") shall fail to make any payment to the Administrative
Agent for the account of any LC Bank in accordance with subsection (b) above
within five Business Days after the LC Payment Notice relating thereto, then,
for so long as such failure shall continue, for purposes of voting rights
hereunder, (i) such LC Bank shall be deemed to be a Lender hereunder owed an ABR
Loan and the Borrower's corresponding reimbursement obligation shall be deemed
to be satisfied and having a Commitment in an amount equal to the outstanding
principal amount due and payable by such non-performing Lender to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Bank pursuant to subsection (b)
above and (ii) the Commitment of such non-performing Lender shall be reduced in
an amount equal to such outstanding principal amount due and payable by such


<PAGE>
                                                                              12


non-performing Lender. Any non-performing Lender and the Borrower (without
waiving any claim against such Lender for such Lender's failure to fund a
participation in the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower under subsection
(b) above) severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the applicable LC Bank forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest
thereon for each day from the date such Lender would have funded its
participation had it complied with the requirements of subsection (b) above
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at a fluctuating
interest rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of such Borrower, the Alternate
Base Rate and (B) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Interest at the rate prescribed in Section 2.08 shall not be due from the
Borrower with respect to any amount payable by the Borrower pursuant to the
preceding sentence unless and until the Borrower fails to comply with the
preceding sentence.

     (d) The payment obligations of each Lender under subsection (b) above and
of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect of any payment under any Letter
of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including
the following circumstances:

               (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document
          or any other agreement or instrument relating hereto or to such Letter
          of Credit;

               (ii) any amendment or waiver of, or any consent to departure
          from, the terms of any Loan Document or such Letter of Credit;

               (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
          that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary, or any
          transferee, of such Letter of Credit (or any persons for whom any such
          beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the LC Bank that
          issued such Letter of Credit, or any other person, whether in
          connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
          or by such Letter of Credit, or any unrelated transaction;

               (iv) any statement or any other document presented under such
          Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
          insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
          inaccurate in any respect;

               (v) payment in good faith by such LC Bank under the Letter of
          Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
          comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or

               (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
          not similar to any of the foregoing.

     (e) The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit. No LC Bank or Lender nor any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates shall
be liable or responsible for (i) the use that may be made of such Letter of
Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee thereof in
connection therewith; (ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of


<PAGE>
                                                                              13


documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to
be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (iii)
payment by any LC Bank against presentation of documents that do not comply with
the terms of such Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear
any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit; or (iv) any other
circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under such Letter
of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have the right to bring suit against
such LC Bank, and such LC Bank shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of
any direct, as opposed to consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower that
the Borrower proves were caused by such LC Bank's willful misconduct or gross
negligence, including, in the case of the Borrower, such LC Bank's willful
failure to make timely payment under such Letter of Credit following the
presentation to it by the beneficiary thereof of a draft and accompanying
certificate(s) that strictly comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter
of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each LC Bank
may accept sight drafts and accompanying certificates presented under any Letter
of Credit issued by such LC Bank that appear on their face to be in order,
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and payment against such documents shall not
constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence by such LC Bank.

     SECTION 2.05. FEES.

     (a) The Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, a fee (the "LC FEE") equal to such Lender's Percentage of, during any
Collateral Period, 0.15% and, at any other time, 1.0% of the daily average face
amounts of all Letters of Credit issued and outstanding during the period from
and including, in the case of such payment to be made on December 31, 2004, the
Restatement Date, and, in the case of each other payment, the preceding payment
date, to and excluding the date of such other payment. All LC Fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360
days.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent, for their own accounts, the administrative and collateral agency fees
provided for in the Letter Agreement (the "ADMINISTRATIVE FEES").

     (c) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate,
among the Lenders and the LC Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be
refundable under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.06. REPAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING CREDITS; EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS.

     (a) The outstanding principal balance of each (i) Eurodollar Loan shall be
due and payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and on
the Maturity Date and (ii) ABR Loan shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date.

     (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness to such Lender (and to such
Lender in its capacity as an LC Bank) resulting from each Loan made by such
Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.


<PAGE>
                                                                              14


     (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will
record (i) the amount of each Letter of Credit issued and each Loan made
hereunder, the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the
amount of any Fees due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's and LC Bank's
share thereof.

     (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsections (b)
and (c) of this Section 2.06 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein
recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or LC Bank or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in
any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Outstanding
Credits in accordance with their terms.

     (e) Any Lender may request that any Loans made by it and the Borrower's
reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued by it be
evidenced by one or more promissory notes substantially in the form of Exhibit
C. In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender one or
more notes payable to the order of such Lender and in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such notes and interest
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04)
be represented by one or more notes in such form payable to the order of the
payee named therein.

     SECTION 2.07. INTEREST ON LOANS.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the
LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the
Applicable Margin from time to time in effect.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising each
ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of (i) 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for periods
during which the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime
Rate and (ii) 360 days for other periods) at a rate per annum equal to the
Alternate Base Rate.

     (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date
applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The
applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate for each Interest Period or day
within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error; provided that the Administrative Agent shall, upon request, provide to
the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination.

     SECTION 2.08. DEFAULT INTEREST.

     If the Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal of or
interest on any Loan, or of any Letter of Credit reimbursement obligation or
interest thereon, or any other amount becoming due hereunder, whether by
scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, the


<PAGE>
                                                                              15


Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the Administrative Agent pay
interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted amount up to (but
not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at
a rate per annum (computed as provided in Section 2.07(b)) equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus 2%.

     SECTION 2.09. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST.

     In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior
to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the
Administrative Agent shall have determined (i) that dollar deposits in the
principal amounts of the Eurodollar Loans comprising such Borrowing are not
generally available in the London interbank market or (ii) that reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, give telecopy notice of such determination to
the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination under
clause (i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to
Section 2.03 shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. In the event
the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the rates at which
dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans during such
Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such
notice, and until the Required Lenders shall have advised the Administrative
Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any
request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be deemed a request for
an ABR Borrowing. Each determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
be made in good faith and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided
that the Administrative Agent, shall, upon request, provide to the Borrower a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination.

     SECTION 2.10. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

     (a) The Commitments shall be automatically terminated on the Maturity Date.

     (b) Upon at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice to
the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently
terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the Total
Commitment; provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the Total
Commitment shall be in an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and in a minimum
principal amount of $10,000,000 and (ii) no such termination or reduction shall
be made that would reduce the Commitment of any Lender to an amount less than
(A) the aggregate amount of Outstanding Credits of such Lender on the date of
such termination or reduction (after giving effect to any prepayment made on
such date pursuant to Section 2.11), or (B) $50,000,000, unless the result of
such termination or reduction referred to in this clause (B) is to reduce the
Total Commitment to $0. The Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of any
notice given pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) and of each Lender's portion of
any such termination or reduction of the Total Commitment. Each reduction in the
Total Commitment under this subsection (b) shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages.


<PAGE>
                                                                              16


     (c) On each day on which the Commitment (as defined in the Parent Facility)
is reduced, the Total Commitment shall automatically and permanently reduce by
an amount equal to such reduction. Each reduction in the Total Commitment under
this subsection (c) shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Percentages.

     (d) If on any date the Total Commitment shall exceed the Outstanding
Credits, the Total Commitment shall automatically and permanently be reduced by
an amount equal to such excess.

     SECTION 2.11. PREPAYMENT.

     (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, upon giving telecopy notice (or
telephone notice promptly confirmed by telecopy) to the Administrative Agent:
(i) before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to
prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) before 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, one Business Day prior to prepayment, in the case of ABR Loans;
provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an
integral multiple of $10,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. Each Borrowing
that is prepaid shall be prepaid ratably in accordance with each Lender's
percentage of the outstanding principal amount of such Borrowing.

     (b) On the date of any termination or reduction of the Commitments pursuant
to Section 2.10, the Borrower shall, by delivering sufficient funds to the
Collateral Agent for application in accordance with Section 6.03, pay or prepay
so much of the Borrowings in an amount as shall be necessary in order that the
Outstanding Credits of each Lender shall not exceed the amount of such Lender's
Commitment.

     (c) On the date of any ABR Borrowing, the Borrower shall prepay any other
ABR Borrowing that is outstanding on such date, subject, however, to the rights
of the Borrower to refinance such outstanding ABR Borrowing pursuant to Section
2.02(d).

     (d) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall be
irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing (or portion
thereof) by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein. All
prepayments under this Section 2.11 shall be subject to Section 9.05(b)(ii) but
otherwise shall be made without premium or penalty. All prepayments under this
Section 2.11 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount
being prepaid to the date of payment.

     SECTION 2.12. RESERVE REQUIREMENTS; CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender or any LC Bank
hereunder (except for changes in respect of taxes on the overall net income of
such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) or its lending office imposed by the


<PAGE>
                                                                              17


jurisdiction in which such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) principal
executive office or lending office is located), or shall result in the
imposition, modification or applicability of any reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or
credit extended by any Lender or any LC Bank, or shall result in the imposition
on any Lender, any LC Bank or the London interbank market of any other condition
affecting this Agreement, such Lender's Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any
Loan (other than an ABR Loan) made by such Lender, and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or LC Bank (as the case
may be) of maintaining any Letter of Credit or making or maintaining any Loan
(other than an ABR Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender or LC Bank
(as the case may be) to be material, then the Borrower shall, upon receipt of
the notice and certificate provided for in Section 2.12(c), promptly pay to such
Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

     (b) If any Lender or any LC Bank shall have determined that the adoption of
any law, rule, regulation or guideline arising out of the July 1988 report of
the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards," or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or any LC Bank (or any
lending office of such Lender or LC Bank) or any Lender's or any LC Bank's
holding company with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) capital or on the capital of
such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, such Lender's Commitment or the Loans made by
such Lender or the Letters of Credit issued by such LC Bank (as the case may be)
pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or LC Bank (as the case
may be) or such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) holding company could
have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) policies and the
policies of such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) holding company with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or LC Bank (as
the case may be) to be material, then from time to time such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) for
any such reduction suffered will be paid by the Borrower to such Lender or LC
Bank (as the case may be).

     (c) A certificate of each Lender or LC Bank setting forth such amount or
amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or LC Bank (as the case
may be) or its holding company as specified in subsection (a) or (b) above, as
the case may be, and containing an explanation in reasonable detail of the
manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been determined, shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay each Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) the amount shown
as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt
of the same. Each Lender and each LC Bank shall give prompt notice to the


<PAGE>
                                                                              18


Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date
hereof, that it has determined will require compensation by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that failure by such Lender or LC
Bank to give such notice shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or LC
Bank's (as the case may be) right to demand compensation hereunder.

     (d) Failure on the part of any Lender or any LC Bank to demand compensation
for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or
reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) right to demand
compensation with respect to such period or any other period; provided, however,
that no Lender or LC Bank shall be entitled to compensation under this Section
2.12 for any costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date
unless it shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand compensation for
such costs or reductions under subsection (c) above not more than 90 days after
the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which it shall have become aware
of such costs or reductions. The protection of this Section shall be available
to each Lender and each LC Bank regardless of any possible contention of the
invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other
change or condition that shall have occurred or been imposed.

     (e) Each Lender and LC Bank agrees that it will designate a different
lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or
LC Bank (as the case may be), be disadvantageous to such Lender or LC Bank (as
the case may be).

     SECTION 2.13. CHANGE IN LEGALITY.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by
written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

               (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by
          such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request for a Eurodollar
          Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an
          ABR Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (any
          Lender delivering such a declaration hereby agreeing to withdraw such
          declaration promptly upon determining that such event of illegality no
          longer exists); and

               (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be
          converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall
          be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of
          such notice as provided in subsection (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under paragraph (i) or (ii)
above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been
applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender


<PAGE>
                                                                              19


or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to
repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the
conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.13, a notice by any Lender shall be
effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest
Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such
notice shall be effective on the date of receipt.

     SECTION 2.14. PRO RATA TREATMENT.

     Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement with respect to the
reimbursement of draws under Letters of Credit and except as required under
Sections 2.11(a), 2.15, 2.18, 6.03 and 9.13, each Borrowing, each payment or
prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans,
each reduction of the Commitments and each refinancing or conversion of any
Borrowing with a Borrowing of any Type, shall be allocated pro rata among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments
shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective
principal amounts of their outstanding Loans or LC Outstandings, as applicable).
Each payment of principal of any Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the
Lenders participating in such Borrowing in accordance with the respective
principal amounts of their outstanding Loans comprising such Borrowing. Each
payment of interest on any Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the
Lenders participating in such Borrowing in accordance with the respective
amounts of accrued and unpaid interest on their outstanding Loans comprising
such Borrowing. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of
any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion, round each Lender's share of such Borrowing to the next higher or
lower whole dollar amount.

     SECTION 2.15. SHARING OF SETOFFS.

     Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in
respect of any Outstanding Credits, as a result of which the unpaid portion of
its Outstanding Credits shall be proportionately less than the unpaid portion of
the Outstanding Credits of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously
to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay
to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Outstanding
Credits of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid amount of the
Outstanding Credits and participations in the Outstanding Credits held by each
Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid amount of all
Outstanding Credits then outstanding as the amount of its Outstanding Credits
prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event
was to the amount of all Outstanding Credits outstanding prior to such exercise
of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however,
that, if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to
this Section 2.15 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be
recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the
extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored
without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements


<PAGE>
                                                                              20


and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in Outstanding Credits deemed
to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien,
setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower
to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan in
the amount of such participation.

     SECTION 2.16. PAYMENTS.

     (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including Letter of Credit
reimbursement obligations, principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or
other amounts) hereunder from an account in the United States not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due in dollars to the
Collateral Agent at its offices at Eleven Madison Avenue, Mail Stop OMA-02, New
York, New York 10010-3629, Attention: Christopher Kim/Agency Group (facsimile:
(212) 325-8304) in immediately available funds. Each such payment shall be made
without off-set, deduction or counterclaim, provided, that the foregoing shall
not constitute a relinquishment or waiver of the Borrower's rights to any
independent claim that the Borrower may have against either Agent, any LC Bank
or any Lender.

     (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whenever any payment
(including any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit or
principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder
shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day,
such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension
of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees,
if applicable.

     SECTION 2.17. TAXES.

     (a) Any and all payments of principal and interest on any of the
Outstanding Credits, or of any Fees or indemnity or expense reimbursements by
the Borrower hereunder ("BORROWER PAYMENTS") shall be made, in accordance with
Section 2.16, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all current or
future United States Federal, state and local taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect to such
Borrower Payments, but only to the extent reasonably attributable to such
Borrower Payments, excluding (i) income taxes imposed on the net income of the
Agents, any LC Bank or any Lender (or any transferee or assignee thereof,
including a participation holder (any such entity a "TRANSFEREE")) and (ii)
franchise taxes imposed on the net income of the Agents, any LC Bank or any
Lender (or Transferee), in each case by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
the Administrative Agent, any LC Bank or such Lender (or Transferee) is
organized or doing business through offices or branches located therein, or any
political subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities, collectively or individually,
"TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender (or any Transferee), the
Agents or LC Bank, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount (an
"ADDITIONAL AMOUNT") necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.17) such Lender (or Transferee), Agent or LC Bank (as the case may be) shall
receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.


<PAGE>
                                                                              21


     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant United States
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any current or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the
Letter Agreement or any other Loan Document ("OTHER TAXES").

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender (or Transferee thereof), each
Agent and each LC Bank for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes with respect
to Borrower Payments paid by such person, and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses)) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by the relevant United States
Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth and containing an
explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in which such amount shall have
been determined and the amount of such payment or liability prepared by a Lender
or an LC Bank, or the Administrative Agent on their behalf, absent manifest
error, shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such
indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date an Lender (or
Transferee), Agent or LC Bank, as the case may be, makes written demand
therefor.

     (d) If any Lender (or Transferee), Agent or LC Bank shall become aware that
it is entitled to claim a refund from a United States Governmental Authority in
respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower, or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts,
pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of the
availability of such refund claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a
request by the Borrower, make a claim to such United States Governmental
Authority for such refund at the Borrower's expense. If any Lender (or
Transferee), Agent or LC Bank receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim
for refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence) in respect of any Taxes or
Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect
to which the Borrower had paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17,
it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to
the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional
amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
such Lender (or Transferee), Agent or LC Bank and without interest (other than
interest paid by the relevant United States Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund); provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the request of such
Lender (or Transferee), Agent or LC Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over
to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender (or
Transferee), Agent or LC Bank in the event such Lender (or Transferee), Agent or
LC Bank is required to repay such refund to such United States Governmental
Authority.

     (e) As soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days, after the date
of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to the relevant United
States Governmental Authority, the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such United States Governmental Authority evidencing
payment thereof.

     (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained
herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.17 shall


<PAGE>
                                                                              22


survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans and
reimbursement obligations hereunder and the termination or expiry of all Letters
of Credit.

     (g) Each Agent, LC Bank and Lender (or Transferee) that is organized under
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, any State thereof or
the District of Columbia (a "NON-U.S. LENDER" or "NON U.S. AGENT", as
applicable) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two
copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form
W-8ECI, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming
complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, United States Federal withholding
tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement. Such forms shall be
delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to
this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation holder,
on or before the date such participation holder becomes a Transferee hereunder)
and on or before the date, if any, such Non-U.S. Lender changes its applicable
lending office by designating a different lending office (a "NEW LENDING
OFFICE"). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly
upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such
Non-U.S. Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(g), a
Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this
Section 2.17(g) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

     (h) The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender or
Non-U.S. Agent (including any Transferee), or to pay any additional amounts to
any Non-U.S. Lender or Non-U.S. Agent (including any Transferee), in respect of
United States Federal, state or local withholding tax pursuant to subsection (a)
or (c) above to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with
respect to United States Federal, state or local withholding tax existed on the
date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a
Transferee that is a participation holder, on the date such participation holder
became a Transferee hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending
Office, the date such Non-U.S. Lender designated such New Lending Office with
respect to any Loan; provided, however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to
any Transferee or New Lending Office that becomes a Transferee or New Lending
Office as a result of an assignment, participation, transfer or designation made
at the request of the Borrower; and provided further, however, that this clause
(i) shall not apply to the extent the indemnity payment or additional amounts
any Transferee, LC Bank or Lender (or Transferee) through a New Lending Office,
would be entitled to receive (without regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed
the indemnity payment or additional amounts that the person making the
assignment, participation or transfer to such Transferee, LC Bank or Lender (or
Transferee) making the designation of such New Lending Office, would have been
entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, participation, transfer
or designation or (ii) the obligation to pay such additional amounts or such
indemnity payments would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U.S.
Lender (including any Transferee) to comply with the provisions of subsections
(g) above and (i) below.

     (i) Any LC Bank or Lender (or Transferee) claiming any indemnity payment or
additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall use reasonable
efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any
certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or to
change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a
filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such
indemnity payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would
not, in the good faith determination of such LC Bank or Lender (or Transferee)


<PAGE>
                                                                              23


(as the case may be), be otherwise disadvantageous to such LC Bank or Lender (or
Transferee) (as the case may be).

     (j) Nothing contained in this Section 2.17 shall require any Lender (or
Transferee), Agent or LC Bank to make available to the Borrower any of its tax
returns (or any other information) that it deems to be confidential or
proprietary.

     SECTION 2.18. ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

     In the event that any Lender or LC Bank shall have delivered a notice or
certificate pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.13, or the Borrower shall be required
to make additional payments to any Lender or LC Bank under Section 2.17, the
Borrower shall have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender or
LC Bank (as the case may be) and the Administrative Agent, to require such
Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) to transfer and assign without recourse
(in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04)
all such Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) interests, rights and
obligations contained hereunder to another financial institution approved by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) which shall assume such obligations; provided that (i) no such
assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority and (ii) the assignee shall pay to the affected Lender or
LC Bank (as the case may be) in immediately available funds on the date of such
assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the
Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts (including, without limitation,
reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit) accrued for its
account or owed to it hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE III

or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in which there is a

any manner draws into question the validity of any Loan Document.

providers where the goods or services are wholly or partially for the benefit of

     SECTION 5.24. CASH COLLATERAL.

     (a) If the Commitments shall not have been terminated in full or any Lender
shall have any Outstanding Credits on January 14, 2005, or at any time an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower shall immediately
deposit cash in an account maintained by or on behalf of the Administrative
Agent (the "CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") in an amount equal to the Cash Collateral
Requirement. Subject to subsection (b) below, the Cash Collateral Account shall
be maintained, at all times after January 14, 2005 and at all times after an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, until the termination of
the Commitments, the expiry or termination of all Letters of Credit and the
payment in full of all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder, with or on
behalf of the Administrative Agent in the name of, and under the sole dominion
and control of, the Administrative Agent, and amounts deposited in the Cash
Collateral Account shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate generally
offered by the depositary with respect to the Cash Collateral Account for
deposits equal to the amount deposited by the Borrower in the Cash Collateral
Account, for a term to be determined by the Administrative Agent, in its
reasonable discretion. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders a Lien in and hereby assigns to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders all of its right, title and
interest in, the Cash Collateral Account and all funds from time to time on
deposit therein to secure its obligations to the Lenders hereunder. If any
amount payable hereunder by the Borrower to any Lender or LC Bank is not paid
when due, the Administrative Agent shall apply the amounts then on deposit in
the Cash Collateral Account toward the payment in full of such amount. Upon
payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower hereunder and the termination


<PAGE>
                                                                              34


of the Commitments and all Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent will
repay and reassign to the Borrower any cash then held in the Cash Collateral
Account, and the Lien of the Administrative Agent on the Cash Collateral Account
and the funds therein shall automatically terminate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the requirement set forth above with respect to the deposit of cash
may be satisfied by delivery to the Administrative Agent of one or more letters
of credit issued by a bank, and otherwise in form, reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent (it being understood and agreed that Wachovia is an
acceptable issuing bank), of which the Administrative Agent is the beneficiary,
in a stated principal amount equal to the Cash Collateral Requirement (any such
letter of credit issued by Wachovia being a "COLLATERAL LC"). If any amount
payable hereunder by the Borrower to any Lender or LC Bank is not paid when due,
the Administrative Agent shall to the maximum extent available draw an amount
under such letters of credit in an amount equal to the amount not paid when due
and then apply the amount so drawn toward the payment in full of such amount not
paid when due.

     (b) The Borrower's obligation under subsection (a) above shall be
suspended, and the Administrative Agent shall cancel and surrender the
Collateral LCs to or to the order of the Borrower on the date specified therefor
(a "CANCELLATION DATE") in a written notice delivered to the Administrative
Agent specifying a remarketing date (a "REMARKETING DATE") for any pollution
control revenue bonds supported by a Letter of Credit (the "SUPPORTED BONDS"
and, such Letters of Credit, the "SUPPORTING LCS"), if (i) the Borrower shall
have satisfied its obligation under subsection (a) above to post cash collateral
by delivering to the Administrative Agent one or more Collateral LCs, (ii) no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (iii) the
Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Financial Officer
stating that (x) all actions and notices required to cause, no later than three
calendar days after the applicable Cancellation Date, Supported Bonds to be
tendered and remarketed in connection with a planned remarketing of such
Supported Bonds due to a substitution of Supporting LCs for such Supported Bonds
(a "REMARKETING") with one or more letters of credit to be issued by Wachovia,
shall have been duly taken or delivered, and no such action or notice relating
to such Remarketing shall have been revoked or rescinded and (y) all letters of
credit to be issued by Wachovia in connection with such Remarketing shall have
an aggregate stated amount at least equal to the aggregate stated amount of
Supporting LCs to be replaced. If any such Remarketing is (A) successful, the
Borrower shall cause such Supporting LCs to be surrendered to the Administrative
Agent no later than the second Business Day following the applicable Remarketing
Date and (B) unsuccessful, the Borrower's obligations under subsection (a) above
shall automatically be reinstated in full.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                               THE REVENUE ACCOUNT

     (b) The Revenue Account shall remain in the exclusive possession of, and
under the sole dominion and control of, the Collateral Agent.

     (c) Each month during the term of this Agreement the Administrative Agent
shall prepare and deliver to the Borrower and each Lender and LC Bank a
statement of the balances in, and each transaction with respect to, the Revenue
Account.

     (d) The Collateral Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with the
investment or reinvestment of any moneys held by it hereunder in accordance with
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including for any delays in the
investment or reinvestment of such moneys, or any loss of interest incidental to
any such delays, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Collateral Agent.

     (e) The Borrower shall deliver to the Collateral Agent such U.S. Internal
Revenue Service forms as are necessary and required for the Collateral Agent to
report the income earned on the investment and reinvestment of the monies in the
Accounts, which obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.02. THE REVENUE ACCOUNT.

     (a) Except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 6.03, the
Collateral Agent shall promptly upon receipt thereof deposit in the Revenue
Account all monies received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 2.16
hereof and Section 4.4 of the Security Agreement. All funds deposited in the
Revenue Account before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on any Business Day shall
be distributed on such Business Day as provided in subsection (b) or (c) below,
as applicable; all funds deposited in the Revenue Account after 12:00 noon (New

distributed on such Business Day pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) below, and if
not practicable, shall be held by the Collateral Agent in the Revenue Account
and distributed pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) below on the following
Business Day. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers the
Collateral Agent, as the attorney-in-fact for the Borrower, to endorse any check
or any other instrument or security to be deposited or held in the Revenue
Account requiring the endorsement of the Borrower, which power is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable until the Maturity Date and the payment in full
of all Outstanding Credits and other amounts payable by the Borrower under the
Loan Documents.

     (b) If no Acceleration shall have occurred, on each Business Day the
Collateral Agent shall distribute funds held in the Revenue Account as of 12:00
noon (New York City time) on such Business Day in the following priority and
amounts, unless otherwise directed by the Borrower and the Lenders (with the
consent of the Trustee if such directions would affect the priority of any
payment to the Trustee or any of its officers, directors, employees,
shareholders or agents):

   FIRST, to the payment of the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any
   indemnity payable by the Borrower to the Trustee or its officers, directors,
   employees, shareholders or agents; SECOND, to the payment of other operating
   expenses of the Borrower certified by the Borrower to the Collateral Agent to

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   THE AGENTS

     SECTION 8.01. THE AGENTS GENERALLY.

     (a) In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
CSFB is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent on
behalf of the Lenders and the LC Banks. Each Lender and LC Bank hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to take
such actions on behalf of such Lender and such LC Bank and to exercise such
powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent by the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Collateral Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders and the LC Banks,
without hereby limiting any implied authority, to receive on behalf of the
Lenders and the LC Banks all payments of principal of and interest on the
Outstanding Credits and all other amounts due to the Lenders and the LC Banks
under the Loan Documents, and promptly to distribute to each Lender and LC Bank
its proper share of each payment so received. The Administrative Agent is hereby
expressly authorized by the Lenders and the LC Banks, without hereby limiting
any implied authority, (i) to give notice on behalf of each Lender and LC Bank
to the Borrower of any Event of Default of which the Administrative Agent has
actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder and (ii) to
distribute to each Lender and LC Bank copies of all notices, financial
statements and other materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

     (b) The Agents may act through their attorneys and agents and shall not be
responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due
care; neither any Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of them except
for its or his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or be

<PAGE>
                                                                              40


responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents
of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or
to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower of
any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan
Document. The Agents shall not be responsible to the Lenders or the LC Banks for
the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of any
Loan Document or other instruments or agreements. The Agents may deem and treat
the Lender or the LC Bank that makes any Loan as the holder of the indebtedness
resulting therefrom for all purposes hereof until it shall have received notice
from such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be), given as provided herein, of
the transfer thereof. The Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions
signed by the Required Lenders and, except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, such instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be
binding on all the Lenders and LC Banks. Each of the Agents shall, in the
absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any instrument or
document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by the proper person or persons. No Agent or any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any responsibility to the
Borrower on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by the
other Agent or any Lender or LC Bank of any of its obligations hereunder or to
the other Agent or any Lender or LC Bank on account of the failure of or delay
in performance or breach by any other Lender or LC Bank, the other Agent or the
Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder or in connection herewith. Each of
the Agents may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or
employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel
selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and shall not be
liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in accordance with
the advice of such counsel.

     (c) The Lenders and the LC Banks hereby acknowledge that neither Agent
shall be under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken
by it pursuant to the provisions of any Loan Document unless it shall be
requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The Agents shall not have
any duties or responsibilities, or be required to exercise any rights or
remedies under the Loan Documents, except as expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents.

     (d) With respect to the Loans made by it and the reimbursement obligations
payable to it hereunder, each Agent, in its individual capacity and not as an
Agent, shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and each of the Agents and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not an
Agent.

     (e) Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the
amount of its pro rata share (based on its Outstanding Credits or, if the amount
of the Outstanding Credits is $0, its Commitment) of any expenses incurred for
the benefit of the Lenders or the LC Banks in its role as Agent, including
counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered
on behalf of the Lenders or the LC Banks, which shall not have been reimbursed
by the Borrower, and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Agents and
any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of
such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,


<PAGE>
                                                                              41


expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against it in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by it under this Agreement to the
extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; provided that no
Lender shall be liable to any Agent for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

     (f) Each Lender and LC Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or LC Bank and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and LC Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or
any other Lender or LC Bank and based on such documents and information as it
shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under or based upon the Loan Documents or any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

     (g) The Collateral Agent may appoint another financial institution (the
"SUB-AGENT") to act as the agent for the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section
8.02(d) for the purpose of maintaining the Revenue Account and each Cash
Collateral Account. The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to perform
such duties as long as the Sub-Agent is acting as such agent and shall not be
liable for the performance or non-performance of such duties by the Sub-Agent.
In acting as such agent for the Collateral Agent, the Sub-Agent, in such
capacity, shall be entitled to the benefit of all provisions of, and be subject
to all obligations under, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including,
without limitation, this Section 8.01, as though the Sub-Agent were the
Collateral Agent.

     SECTION 8.02. REPLACEMENT OF AGENTS.

     (a) Resignation. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Agent as provided in this subsection (a), either Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders, the LC Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent
acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may,
on behalf of the Lenders and the LC Banks, appoint a successor Agent having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

     (b) Removal. The Lenders may remove any Agent upon 30 days' prior notice by
so notifying the Borrower and, in such event, the Lenders shall appoint a
successor Agent acceptable to the Borrower. Either the Required Lenders or the
Borrower may remove any Agent if (i) such Agent is adjudged bankrupt or


<PAGE>
                                                                              42


insolvent or (ii) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of such Agent
or its property. If no successor Agent shall have been appointed by the Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after delivery by the
Lenders of the notice required by the first sentence of this subsection (b), the
Required Lenders or the Borrower may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Agent. After any Agent's removal
hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as Agent. Upon the acceptance by a successor Collateral
Agent of its appointment as Collateral Agent (x) the retiring Collateral Agent
shall transfer all property held by it as Collateral Agent to the successor
Collateral Agent and (y) such successor Collateral Agent shall succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Collateral Agent and the retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 8.03. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, the
powers conferred on the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents are solely to
protect its interest (on behalf of the Secured Parties) in the Collateral and
shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the
reasonable care of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for
moneys actually received by it under the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent
shall have no duty as to any Collateral, or responsibility, for (i) ascertaining
or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities,
tenders or other matters relative to any investment property constituting
Collateral, whether or not the Collateral Agent has or is deemed to have
knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights
against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The
Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral
is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own
property.

     (b) The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for interest on any money or
assets received by it except as the Collateral Agent may agree in writing with
the Borrower. Assets held in trust by the Collateral Agent need not be
segregated from other assets except to the extent required by law.

     (c) Before the Collateral Agent acts or refrains from acting, it may
require a certificate of a Responsible Officer at the expense of the Borrower.
The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to
take in good faith in reliance on such officer's certificate.

     (d) The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action that it takes
or omits to take in good faith that it reasonably believes to be authorized or
within its rights or powers under the Security Documents.

     (e) The Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into
the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
debenture, or other paper or document, but the Collateral Agent, in its


<PAGE>
                                                                              43


discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or
matters as it may see fit and, if the Collateral Agent shall determine to make
such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled, upon reasonable
notice to the Borrower, to examine the books, records and premises of the
Borrower, personally or by agent or attorney and to consult with the officers
and representatives of the Borrower, including the Borrower's accountants and
attorneys. Except as expressly stated herein to the contrary, in no event shall
the Collateral Agent have any responsibility to ascertain whether there has been
compliance with any of the covenants or provisions of the Security Documents.

     (f) The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers vested in it by the Security Documents at the request,
order or direction of the Required Lenders (with respect to the Security
Agreement) or of the "Bank" (as defined in and with respect to each Pledge
Agreement) unless such Lenders shall have offered to the Collateral Agent
security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent against
the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by it in compliance
with such request, order or direction.

     (g) The Collateral Agent shall not be required to give any bond or surety
in respect of the performance of its powers and duties under the Security
Documents.

     (h) The Collateral Agent may from time to time, at its option, perform any
act that the Borrower agrees hereunder to perform and that the Borrower shall
fail to perform after being requested in writing so to perform (it being
understood that no such request need be given after the occurrence of an Event
of Default) and the Collateral Agent may from time to time take any other action
that the Collateral Agent reasonably deems necessary for the maintenance,
preservation or protection of any of the Collateral or of its security interest
therein.

     (i) The Collateral Agent is authorized to endorse, in the name of the
Borrower, any item, howsoever received by the Collateral Agent, representing any
payment on or other proceeds of any of the Collateral.

that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign any rights hereunder or any
interest herein without the prior consent of all the Lenders.

     SECTION 9.04. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

     (a) Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to,
such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such
party, and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any party
that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of its
successors and assigns.

     (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including (i) all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Outstanding Credits at the time owing to it
and (ii) its rights and obligations as an LC Bank); provided, however, that (i)
except in the case of an assignment to another Lender or to an Affiliate of such
Lender, an assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or an assignment made at any
time an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower (if
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Administrative Agent
must give their prior written consent to such assignment (in each case, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) the amount of the Commitment
of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the


<PAGE>
                                                                              45


date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 or, if the amount
of the Commitment of the assigning Lender is less than $1,000,000, the aggregate
amount of such Lender's Commitment, (iii) each such assignment shall be of a
constant, and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents and (iv) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
and Acceptance. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to Section 9.04(e), from
and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which
effective date shall be at least five Business Days after the execution thereof
unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent (the Borrower to be given
reasonable notice of any shorter period), (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender and LC Bank under the
Loan Documents and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under the Loan Documents (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto (but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.17
and 9.05 afforded to such Lender prior to its assignment as well as to any Fees
accrued for its account hereunder and not yet paid)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Lender assigning its rights and obligations under this Agreement
may retain any Loans made by it outstanding at such time, and in such case shall
retain its rights hereunder in respect of any Loans so retained until such Loans
have been repaid in full in accordance with this Agreement.

     (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning
Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such
assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, (ii) except
as set forth in (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with the Loan Documents,
or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency
or value of the Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or
observance by the Borrower of any obligations under the Loan Documents or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, (iii) such assignor and
such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter
into such Assignment and Acceptance, (iv) such assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.04 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance, (v) such assignee will
independently and without reliance upon the Agents, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender or LC Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents, (vi) such assignee
appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf
and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to such Agent
by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto, and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all the obligations that by the terms of the Loan Documents are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at one of its offices in the
City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Outstanding Credits owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error and
the Borrower, the Agents, the LC Banks and the Lenders may treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by each party hereto, at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (e) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee and, if required, the written consent of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to such assignment, the Administrative
Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register.

     (f) Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
in all or a portion of its rights and/or obligations under the Loan Documents
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Outstanding Credits owing
to it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under the Loan
Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) each participating bank or other entity shall be entitled to the benefit
of the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.12, 2.17 and 9.05 to
the same extent as if it were the selling Lender (and limited to the amount that
could have been claimed by the selling Lender had it continued to hold the
interest of such participating bank or other entity), except that all claims
made pursuant to such Sections shall be made through such selling Lender, and
(iv) the Borrower, the Agents, the LC Banks and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such selling Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications or waivers (x)
decreasing any fees payable hereunder or the amount of principal of, or the rate
at which interest is payable on, the Outstanding Credits, (y) extending any
scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on
the Outstanding Credits or (z) extending the Commitments).

     (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section,
disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any
information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of
the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, each such assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant shall execute an agreement
whereby such assignee or participant shall agree (subject to customary
exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of any such information.

     (h) The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any rights and duties
hereunder without the prior written consent of all Lenders, and any attempted
assignment or delegation by the Borrower without such consent shall be void.


<PAGE>
                                                                              47


     (i) Any Lender may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge
shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
Bank for such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such an
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, the Borrower shall, at the request of the
assigning Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory
note or notes evidencing the extensions of credit made to the Borrower by the
assigning Lender hereunder.

     SECTION 9.05. EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

     (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Agents in connection with entering into this Agreement (whether
or not the transactions hereby contemplated are consummated) and in connection
with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (but only
if such amendments, modifications or waivers are requested by the Borrower),
including the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the Agents,
the Lenders and LC Banks and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Agents, any LC Bank or any Lender in connection with any claim or claims
arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and enforcement following an Event of Default, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents, the Lenders and the
LC Banks. In addition to the foregoing, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the
LC Banks for such reasonable, normal and customary costs and expenses as are
incurred or charged by the LC Banks in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment
under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and LC Bank against any
loss, calculated in accordance with the next sentence, or reasonable expense
that such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (i) any failure by the Borrower to borrow or to refinance,
convert or continue any Loan hereunder (including as a result of the Borrower's
failure to fulfill any of the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV)
after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, refinancing, conversion or
continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03, (ii) any payment,
prepayment or conversion, or assignment of a Eurodollar Loan of the Borrower
required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed
made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period, if any,
applicable thereto, (iii) any default in payment or prepayment of the principal
amount of any Outstanding Credit or any part thereof or interest accrued
thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether by
scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise)
or (iv) the occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each such case,
any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or
incurred by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties,
or with respect to commitments made or obligations undertaken with third
parties, to effect or maintain any Loan hereunder or any part thereof as a
Eurodollar Loan. Such loss shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (x) its cost of obtaining the funds
for the Loan being paid, prepaid, refinanced, converted or not borrowed (assumed
to be the LIBO) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment,
refinancing or failure to borrow or refinance to the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow or refinance the
Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) over (y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such
Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid,


<PAGE>
                                                                              48


prepaid or not borrowed or refinanced for such period or Interest Period, as the
case may be.

     (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agents, each Lender, each LC Bank,
each of their Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and agents of
the foregoing (each such person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and to
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the
preparation, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of
this Agreement, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Letters of Credit or the
Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto,
including any of the foregoing arising from the negligence, whether sole or
concurrent, on the part of any Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from any litigation
brought by such Indemnitee against the Borrower or by the Borrower against such
Indemnitee, in which a final, nonappealable judgment has been rendered against
such Indemnitee; provided, further, that the Borrower agrees that it will not,
without the prior written consent of each Indemnitee, settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action,
suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification could be sought under the
indemnification provisions of this Section 9.05(c) (whether or not any
Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such claim, action, suit or
proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent does not include any
statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any Indemnitee and does not involve any payment of money or other
value by any Indemnitee or any injunctive relief or factual findings or
stipulations binding on any Indemnitee.

     (d) The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in full force
and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of
the Outstanding Credits, the expiration or termination of the Commitment, the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent, Lender or LC Bank. All amounts
due under this Section shall be payable on written demand therefor.

     (e) A certificate of any Lender, LC Bank or Agent setting forth any amount
or amounts that such Lender, LC Bank or Agent is entitled to receive pursuant to
subsection (b) of this Section and containing an explanation in reasonable
detail of the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been determined
shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

     SECTION 9.06. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF THE TRUSTEE.

     It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that (i) this document
is executed and delivered by Wilmington Trust Company, not individually or
personally, but solely as Trustee, in the exercise of the powers and authority
conferred and vested in it pursuant to the Trust Agreement, (ii) each of the
representations, undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of the


<PAGE>
                                                                              49


Borrower is made and intended not as a personal representation, undertaking and
agreement by Wilmington Trust Company but is made and intended for the purpose
for binding only the Borrower, (iii) nothing herein contained shall be construed
as creating any liability on Wilmington Trust Company, individually or
personally, to perform any covenant, either expressed or implied, contained
herein, all such liability, if any, being expressly waived by the parties hereto
and by any person claiming by, through or under the parties hereto, and (iv)
under no circumstances shall Wilmington Trust Company be personally liable for
the payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Borrower or be liable for the
breach or failure of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant made
or undertaken by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other related
documents.

     SECTION 9.07. RIGHT OF SETOFF.

     If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender
and LC Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or LC Bank to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of
the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender
or LC Bank (as the case may be), irrespective of whether or not such Lender or
LC Bank (as the case may be) shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender and LC
Bank under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) that such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) may
have.

     SECTION 9.08. APPLICABLE LAW.

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     SECTION 9.09. WAIVERS; AMENDMENT.

     (a) No failure or delay of either Agent or any Lender or LC Bank in
exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Lenders and the LC
Banks hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by subsection (b) below, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle such party
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended
or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such
agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the maturity of
or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of any interest


<PAGE>
                                                                              50


on any Outstanding Credit, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part
thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Outstanding Credit, without the
prior written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) increase any
Commitment or decrease the LC Fee of any Lender without the prior written
consent of such Lender, (iii) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.14,
2.15, 6.02, 6.03 or 9.04(h), the provisions of this Section or the definition of
"Cash Collateral Requirement" or "Required Lenders", or (iv) release any of the
Collateral (other than in connection with Restricted Payments permitted under
Section 5.12), without the prior written consent of each Lender affected
thereby; provided further, however, that no such agreement shall amend, modify
or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, any LC Bank or the Trustee without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such LC Bank or the Trustee,
as the case may be. Each Lender and LC Bank shall be bound by any waiver,
amendment or modification authorized by this Section and any consent by any
Lender, the Administrative Agent or any LC Bank pursuant to this Section shall
bind any assignee of its rights and interests hereunder.

     SECTION 9.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

     This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto) and the Letter
Agreement represent the entire contract among the parties relative to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. Any previous agreement, whether written or
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, is superseded
by this Agreement and the Letter Agreement. There are no unwritten oral
agreements between the parties. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto and the
Trustee, which is an intended third party beneficiary hereof, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.11. SEVERABILITY.

     In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in
good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

     SECTION 9.12. COUNTERPARTS.

     This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section
9.03.

     SECTION 9.13. HEADINGS.

     Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for
convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Agreement.

                                                                              51


     SECTION 9.14. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the
applicable interest rate, together with all fees and charges that are treated as
interest under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), as provided for
herein or in any other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise
contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender or LC Bank,
shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be
contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by such Lender or LC Bank
(as the case may be) in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest
payable on the Outstanding Credits of such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may
be), together with all Charges payable to such Lender or LC Bank (as the case
may be), shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

     (b) If the amount of interest, together with all Charges, payable for the
account of any Lender or LC Bank in respect of any interest computation period
is reduced pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section and the amount of
interest, together with all Charges, payable for such Lender's or LC Bank's (as
the case may be) account in respect of any subsequent interest computation
period, computed pursuant to Section 2.07, would be less than the Maximum Rate,
then the amount of interest, together with all Charges, payable for such
Lender's or LC Bank's (as the case may be) account in respect of such subsequent
interest computation period shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
automatically increased to such Maximum Rate; provided that at no time shall the
aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of any Lender or LC Bank
has been increased pursuant to this subsection (b) exceed the aggregate amount
by which interest, together with all Charges, paid for its account has
theretofore been reduced pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section.

     SECTION 9.15. JURISDICTION; VENUE.

     (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court
or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Subject to the foregoing and to subsection (b) below, nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any right that any party hereto may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any other party hereto
in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or thereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by


<PAGE>
                                                                              52


law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

     SECTION 9.16. CONFIDENTIALITY.

     Each Lender and LC Bank shall use its best efforts to hold in confidence
all information, memoranda, or extracts furnished to such Lender or LC Bank (as
the case may be) (directly or through the Agents) by the Borrower hereunder or
in connection with the negotiation hereof; provided that such Lender and LC Bank
may disclose any such information, memoranda or extracts (i) to its Affiliates,
accountants or counsel, (ii) to any regulatory agency having authority to
examine such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be), (iii) as required by any
legal or governmental process or otherwise by law, (iv) to any person to which
such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) sells or proposes to sell an
assignment or a participation in its extensions of credit hereunder, if such
other person agrees for the benefit of the Borrower to comply with the
provisions of this Section, and (v) to the extent that such information,
memoranda or extracts shall be publicly available or shall have become known to
such Lender or LC Bank (as the case may be) independently of any disclosure by
the Borrower hereunder or in connection with the negotiation hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender and any LC Bank may disclose the
provisions of this Agreement and the amounts, maturities and interest rates of
its Outstanding Credits to any purchaser or potential purchaser of such Lender's
or LC Bank's (as the case may be) interest in any Outstanding Credits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto (and each officer, director,
employee, representative, agent and advisor of each party hereto) may disclose
to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the "tax treatment" and
"tax structure" (in each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such "tax treatment" and "tax structure".
The foregoing is intended to comply with the presumption set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(iii) and should be interpreted in a manner
consistent with such regulation.

     SECTION 9.17. APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS

     Each Lender and LC Bank hereby authorizes and instructs the Collateral
Agent to enter into each document described in Sections 4.01(a)(ii) through (iv)
and to release the security interests to be released pursuant thereto.

$______________                                               New York, New York


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, LOC 2003 TRUST, a Delaware statutory
trust (the "BORROWER"), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of _________________
or registered assigns (the "LENDER"), on the Maturity Date (such term, and each
other capitalized term used but not defined herein, having the meaning ascribed
thereto in the Credit Agreement (as defined below)), for the account of the
Lender at the office of the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement, in
lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds,
the principal sum of ___________________ DOLLARS ($_____________) or, if less,
the aggregate principal amount of the Loans made by the Lender to the Borrower
pursuant to the Credit Agreement outstanding on such Maturity Date; provided,
however, that the principal amount outstanding under this Promissory Note is
subject to prepayment and repayment from time to time, with accrued interest
thereon, as specified in the Credit Agreement. The Borrower further agrees to
pay interest in like money to the Lender on the unpaid principal amount hereof
from the date hereof at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as
specified in the Credit Agreement.

     The Lender is authorized to record on the schedule annexed hereto (i) the
date and amount of each Loan made by the Lender to the Borrower, (ii) the
character thereof as an ABR Loan or a Eurodollar Loan, (iii) the interest rate
and the Interest Period applicable to each Eurodollar Loan, and (iv) the date
and amount of each conversion of, and each payment or prepayment of principal
of, each Loan; provided, that the failure to so record or any error in so
recording shall not affect the payment obligations of the Borrower hereunder or
under the Credit Agreement.

     This Promissory Note is delivered pursuant to, and is entitled to the
benefits of, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 22,
2004 (as the same may be amended, modified or supplemented, the "CREDIT
AGREEMENT"), among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto (the "BANKS") and
Credit Suisse First Boston, acting through its Cayman Islands branch, as
Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) provides for
the making of Loans by the Banks to the Borrower from time to time in an
aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed at any time the Total Commitment, the
indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender resulting from each such Loan made by
the Lender being evidenced by this Promissory Note, and (ii) contains provisions
for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated
events and also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the
maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified. The Borrower
hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. No failure to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part of the
holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.

                      FIRST AMENDMENT TO SECURITY AGREEMENT

     This AMENDMENT, dated as of December 22, 2004 (this "AMENDMENT"), is made
to that certain Security Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2003 (as amended,

acting through its Cayman Islands branch, as collateral agent (the "COLLATERAL
AGENT") for the secured parties named therein (the "SECURED PARTIES").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENT:

     The Grantor has requested that the Collateral Agent and the other Secured
Parties agree to the amendment of the Security Agreement as set forth herein,

     (a) Section 1.01 of the Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting in
its entirety the definition of "Pledge Agreement Collateral".

     (b) Section 2.1 of the Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the
last paragraph of such Section.

a reference to this Amendment and the Security Agreement, as amended hereby) are
true and correct on and as of the date hereof as though made on and as of such
date; and

     (f) no event has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the
execution and delivery of this Amendment, that constitutes a Default or an Event

Loan Documents (as amended through the date hereof) shall continue to be in full

nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Security Agreement or the other
Loan Documents.

     SECTION 5 COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES.

     The Grantor agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the
Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of
this Amendment and the other instruments and documents to be delivered
hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of counsel for the Collateral Agent with respect thereto, and all costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees and expenses), if any,
in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of this Amendment or such other instruments and
documents. In addition, the Grantor agrees to pay any and all stamp and other
taxes payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Amendment and the other instruments and documents to be

to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes.

     SECTION 6 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.

of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute but one agreement.

          AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"),
          dated as of December 22, 2004, between TXU Corp., a Texas
          corporation (the "BORROWER"), and LOC 2003 Trust, a Delaware
          statutory trust (the "LENDER").

     The Lender has previously provided a credit facility for the making of
loans to the Borrower and the issuance of letters of credit for the benefit of
the Borrower. The Lender has agreed to amend and restate such credit facility on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

     Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                           DEFINITIONS; CONSTRUCTION

     SECTION 1.01. DEFINED TERMS.

     As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
specified below:

          "ABR LOAN" shall mean any Loan bearing interest at a rate determined
     by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the provisions
     of Article II or any Eurodollar Loan converted (pursuant to Section 2.09 or
     2.13(a)(ii)) to a loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference
     to the Alternate Base Rate.

          "ACQUISITION DATE" shall mean the date as of which a person or group
     of related persons first acquires more than 30% of any outstanding class of
     Voting Shares of the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d)
     of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder).

          "AFFILIATE" shall mean, when used with respect to a specified person,
     another person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by or
     is under common control with the person specified.

          "AGREEMENT" shall have the meaning given such term in the preamble
     hereto.

          "ALTERNATE BASE RATE" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum
     (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/100 of 1%) equal to the
     greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus
     .50% and (ii) the Prime Rate in effect on such day. For purposes hereof,
     "PRIME RATE" shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly announced
     from time to time by the Reference Bank as its base rate in effect at its
     principal office in New York City; each change in the Prime Rate shall be
     effective on the date such change is announced publicly as effective; and
     "FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE" shall mean, for any day, the weighted
     average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members
     of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers, as
     released on the next succeeding Business Day by the Federal Reserve Bank of
     New York, or, if such rate is not so released for any day that is a
     Business Day, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Reference Bank,
     of the quotations for the day of such transactions received by the
     Reference Bank from three Federal funds brokers of recognized standing

<PAGE>
                                                                               2


     selected by it. If for any reason the Lender shall have determined (which
     determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that the
     Lender shall, upon request, provide to the Borrower a certificate setting
     forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination) that it is
     unable to ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate for any reason,
     including the inability of the Reference Bank to obtain sufficient
     quotations in accordance with the terms thereof, the Alternate Base Rate
     shall be determined without regard to clause (i) of the first sentence of
     this definition until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no
     longer exist. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the
     Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the
     effective date of such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds
     Effective Rate, respectively.

          "APPLICABLE MARGIN" shall mean, during any Collateral Period (as
     defined in the New Trust Facility), 0.20% per annum and, at all other
     times, 1.05% per annum.

     System of the United States.

     or any duly authorized committee thereof.

          "BORROWER" shall have the meaning given such term in the preamble
     hereto.

     Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the State of New York or the State of
     Delaware) on which banks are open for business in New York City and
     Wilmington, Delaware; provided, however, that, when used in connection with
     a Eurodollar Loan, the term "Business Day" shall also exclude any day on
     which banks are not open for dealings in dollar deposits in the London
     interbank market.

          A "CHANGE IN CONTROL" shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any
     person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the
     Exchange Act) shall acquire beneficial ownership of more than 30% of any
     outstanding class of Voting Shares of the Borrower unless such acquisition
     shall have been approved prior to such acquisition date by a majority of
     Disinterested Directors of the Borrower or (ii) during any period of 12
     consecutive months, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
     cease to be composed of individuals (A) who were members of the Board of
     Directors on the first day of such period, (B) whose election or nomination
     to the Board of Directors was approved by individuals referred to in clause
     (i) above constituting at the time of such election or nomination at least
     a majority of the Board of Directors or (C) whose election or nomination to
     the Board of Directors was approved by individuals referred to in clauses

     to arrange the issuance of Letters of Credit in an aggregate amount not in

     time pursuant to Section 7.04. The Commitment shall automatically and

          "WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY" shall mean liability of the Borrower
     established under Section 4201 of ERISA as a result of a complete or
     partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan, as such terms are defined in
     Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

     SECTION 1.02. TERMS GENERALLY.

     The definitions in Section 1.01 shall apply equally to both the singular
and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any

                                                                              12


by the phrase "without limitation". All references herein to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits and Schedules shall be deemed references to Articles and Sections of,
and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement unless the context shall otherwise
require. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an
accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in
effect from time to time; provided, however, that for purposes of determining
compliance with any covenant set forth in Article V, such terms shall be
construed in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date hereof applied on a
basis consistent with the application used in preparing the Borrower's audited
financial statements referred to in Section 3.05.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   THE CREDITS

     SECTION 2.01. THE COMMITMENT.

     The Lender has, prior to the date hereof, arranged the issuance of Letters
of Credit for the account of the Borrower in the amounts and with the expiration
dates specified on Schedule 1.01. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Lender
agrees, at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date to finance
and re-finance the Borrower's reimbursement obligations in respect of drawings
under Letters of Credit, as required pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or as permitted
pursuant to Section 2.02(c), in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not to exceed the Commitment, subject, however, to the conditions
that at no time shall the Outstanding Credits exceed the Commitment. Once repaid
hereunder, Loans may not be reborrowed, other than pursuant to Section 2.02(c),
and no Letter of Credit may be extended or may be modified to increase the
stated amount thereof.

     SECTION 2.02. LOANS.

     (a) Each Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral
multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000 (or an aggregate principal
amount equal to (x) the remaining balance of the available Commitment or (y) the
amount of the Borrower's reimbursement obligation being financed or refinanced
thereby).

     (b) Each Loan shall be a Eurodollar Loan or an ABR Loan, as the Borrower
may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Loans of more than one Type may be
outstanding at the same time.

     (c) The Borrower may refinance all or any part of any Loan with a Loan of
the same or a different Type, subject to the conditions and limitations set
forth in this Agreement. Any Loan or part thereof so refinanced shall be deemed
to be repaid or prepaid in accordance with Section 2.06 or 2.11, as applicable,
with the proceeds of a new Loan.

     SECTION 2.03. LOAN PROCEDURE.

     In order to request a Loan to refinance Loans made under Section 2.04(b) or
to refinance any such Loan, the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the
Lender a duly completed Lending Request in the form of Exhibit A (i) in the case
of a Eurodollar Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three


<PAGE>
                                                                              13


Business Days before such Loan, and (ii) in the case of an ABR Loan, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before such Loan. Such
notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case specify (A) whether the Loan
then being requested is to be a Eurodollar Loan or an ABR Loan; (B) the date of
such Loan (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof; and (C) if
such Loan is to be a Eurodollar Loan, the Interest Period with respect thereto,
which shall not end after the Maturity Date. If no election as to the Type of
Loan is specified in any such notice, then the requested Loan shall be an ABR
Loan. If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan is specified in
any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
Period of one month's duration (subject to the limitations set forth in the
definition of "Interest Period"). If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with this Section 2.03 of its election to refinance a Loan prior to
the end of the Interest Period in effect for such Loan, then the Borrower shall
(unless such Loan is repaid at the end of such Interest Period) be deemed to
have given notice of an election to refinance such Loan with an ABR Loan.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Loan
shall be requested if the Interest Period with respect thereto would end after
the scheduled Maturity Date.

     SECTION 2.04. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

     (a) The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Lender on each date on which
any amount is paid under any Letter of Credit a sum equal to the amount so paid.

     (b) If the Lender shall not have been reimbursed in full by the Borrower
for any payment made by the Lender on or prior to the Maturity Date under a
Letter of Credit on the date of such payment, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have requested and received from the Lender an ABR Loan in the amount, and on
the date, of such payment by the Lender.

     (c) The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect
of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
     other agreement or instrument relating hereto or to such Letter of Credit;

          (ii) any amendment or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, the
     terms of this Agreement or such Letter of Credit;

          (iii) the existence of any claim, set off, defense or other right that
     the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary, or any
     transferee, of such Letter of Credit (or any persons for whom any such
     beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting) or any other person,
     whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
     hereby or by such Letter of Credit, or any unrelated transaction;

          (iv) any statement or any other document presented under such Letter
     of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
     respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;


<PAGE>
                                                                              14


          (v) payment in good faith under the Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms
     of such Letter of Credit; or

          (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
     similar to any of the foregoing.

     SECTION 2.05. LC FEE.

     (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender, on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December, a letter of credit fee (the "LC FEE")
equal to, during any Collateral Period, 0.20% and, at all other times, 1.05% of
the daily average face amounts of all Letters of Credit issued and outstanding
during the period from and including, in the case of such payment to be made on
December 31, 2004, the Restatement Date, and, in the case of each other payment,
the preceding payment date, to and excluding the date of such other payment.

     (b) The LC Fee shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days and shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Lender. Once paid, the LC Fee shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.06. REPAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING CREDITS; EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS.

     (a) The outstanding principal balance of each (i) Eurodollar Loan shall be
due and payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and on
the Maturity Date and (ii) ABR Loan shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date.

     (b) The Lender shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the
amount of each Letter of Credit issued and each Loan made hereunder, the Type of
each Loan made and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of
any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to the Lender hereunder, (iii) the amount and stated expiry date of
each Letter of Credit and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Lender
hereunder from the Borrower.

     (c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b)
of this Section 2.06 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima
facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of the Lender to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower
to repay the Outstanding Credits in accordance with their terms.

     SECTION 2.07. INTEREST ON LOANS.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, each Eurodollar Loan shall
bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a
year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the LIBO Rate for the Interest
Period in effect for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, each ABR Loan shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of (i) 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for periods during which the
Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate and (ii) 360


<PAGE>
                                                                              15


days for other periods) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

     (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date
applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The
applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate for each Interest Period or day
within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the
Lender, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error;
provided that the Lender shall, upon request, provide to the Borrower a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination.

     SECTION 2.08. DEFAULT INTEREST.

     If the Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal of or
interest on any Loan, any reimbursement obligation under Section 2.04(a), or any
other amount becoming due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of
prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to
time from the Lender pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed as provided in Section
2.07(b)) equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2%.

     SECTION 2.09. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST.

     In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior
to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan the Lender
shall have determined (i) that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of such
Eurodollar Loan are not generally available in the London interbank market or
(ii) that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the
Lender shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give telecopy notice of such
determination to the Borrower. In the event of any such determination under
clause (i) or (ii) above, until the Lender shall have advised the Borrower that
the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist any request by the
Borrower for a Eurodollar Loan pursuant to Section 2.03 shall be deemed to be a
request for an ABR Loan. In the event the Lender determine that the rates at
which dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect
the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans during such
Interest Period, the Lender shall notify the Borrower and until the Lender shall
determine that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any
request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Loan shall be deemed a request for an
ABR Loan. Each determination by the Lender hereunder shall be made in good faith
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that the Lender, shall,
upon request, provide to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such determination.

     SECTION 2.10. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENT.

     (a) The Commitment shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

     (b) Upon at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice to
the Lender, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from
time to time in part permanently reduce, the Commitment; provided, however, that
(i) each partial reduction of the Commitment shall be in an integral multiple of
$10,000,000, (ii) no such termination or reduction shall be made that would


<PAGE>
                                                                              16


reduce the Commitment to an amount less than (A) the Outstanding Credits on the
date of such termination or reduction (after giving effect to any prepayment
made pursuant to Section 2.11) or (B) $50,000,000, unless the result of such
termination or reduction referred to in this clause (B) is to reduce the
Commitment to $0 and (iii) the Borrower may not in any event reduce the
Commitment to an amount less than the "Total Commitment" under the New Trust
Facility.

     (c) The Borrower agrees that, upon any reduction in the "Total Commitment"
under the New Trust Facility, the Commitment shall automatically be reduced by
an amount equal to the amount of such reduction.

     (d) If, on any date, the Commitment shall exceed the Outstanding Credits,
the Commitment shall automatically and permanently be reduced by an amount equal
to such excess.

     SECTION 2.11. PREPAYMENT.

     (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
prepay any Loan, in whole or in part, upon giving telecopy notice (or telephone
notice promptly confirmed by telecopy) to the Lender: (i) before 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, three Business Days prior to prepayment, in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business
Day prior to prepayment, in the case of ABR Loans; provided, however, that each
partial prepayment shall be in an amount which is an integral multiple of
$10,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000.

     (b) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall be
irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Loan (or portion
thereof) by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein. All
prepayments under this Section 2.11 shall be subject to Section 7.05(b) but
otherwise without premium or penalty. All prepayments under this Section 2.11
shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid
to the date of payment.

     SECTION 2.12. RESERVE REQUIREMENTS; CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to the Lender hereunder
(except for changes in respect of taxes on the overall net income of the Lender
imposed by the jurisdiction in which the Lender's principal executive office is
located), or shall result in the imposition, modification or applicability of
any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of or credit extended by the Lender, or shall result in
the imposition on the Lender or the London interbank market of any other
condition affecting this Agreement, the Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any
Loan (other than an ABR Loan), and the result of any of the foregoing shall be
to increase the cost to the Lender of maintaining any Letter of Credit or making
or maintaining any Loan (other than an ABR Loan) or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable by the Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by the Lender to be material, then


<PAGE>
                                                                              17


the Borrower shall, upon receipt of the notice and certificate provided for in
Section 2.12(c), promptly pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate the Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

     (b) If the Lender shall have determined that the adoption of any law, rule,
regulation or guideline arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle
Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards," or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by the Lender or the Lender's holding
company with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
Lender's capital or on the capital of the Lender's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any Loan
made by the Lender pursuant hereto to a level below that which the Lender or the
Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration the Lender's policies and the policies of
the Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by the Lender to be material, then from time to time such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender for any such reduction suffered
will be paid by the Borrower to the Lender.

     (c) A certificate of the Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as
shall be necessary to compensate the Lender or its holding company as specified
in subsection (a) or (b) above, and containing an explanation, in reasonable
detail, of the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been
determined, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.
The Lender shall give prompt notice to the Borrower of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, that it has determined will require
compensation by the Borrower pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that
failure by the Lender to give such notice shall not constitute a waiver of the
Lender's right to demand compensation hereunder.

     (d) Failure on the part of the Lender to demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
the Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any
other period; provided, however, that the Lender shall not be entitled to
compensation under this Section 2.12 for any costs incurred or reductions
suffered with respect to any date unless it shall have notified the Borrower
that it will demand compensation for such costs or reductions under subsection
(c) above not more than 90 days after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the
date on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions. The
protection of this Section shall be available to the Lender regardless of any
possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule,
regulation, guideline or other change or condition that shall have occurred or
been imposed.

                                                                              18


     SECTION 2.13. CHANGE IN LEGALITY.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for the Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by
written notice to the Borrower, the Lender may:

          (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by the
     Lender hereunder, whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Loan shall, as to
     the Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan unless such
     declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (the Lender delivering such a
     declaration hereby agreeing to withdraw such declaration promptly upon
     determining that such event of illegality no longer exists); and

          (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be
     converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be
     automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
     notice as provided in subsection (b) below.

In the event the Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by the Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans of the Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans made by the Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans.

     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.13, a notice by the Lender shall be
effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest
Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such
notice shall be effective on the date of receipt.

     SECTION 2.14. PAYMENTS.

     (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or
interest on or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Outstanding Credit
or any LC Fee or other amounts) hereunder from an account in the United States
not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due in dollars
to the Lender at such account as the Lender may specify from time to time in
writing to the Borrower, in immediately available funds. Each such payment shall
be made without off-set, deduction or counterclaim, provided, that the foregoing
shall not constitute a relinquishment or waiver of the Borrower's rights to any
independent claim that the Borrower may have against the Lender.

     (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on or any
reimbursement obligation in respect of any Outstanding Credit or the LC Fee or
other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day
that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of interest or the LC Fee, if applicable.

                                       19


     SECTION 2.15. TAXES.

     (a) Any and all payments of principal and interest on any Outstanding
Credit, or of the LC Fee or indemnity or expense reimbursements by the Borrower
hereunder ("BORROWER PAYMENTS") shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.14,
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all current or future United
States Federal, state and local taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect to such Borrower Payments, but
only to the extent reasonably attributable to such Borrower Payments, excluding
(i) income taxes imposed on the net income of the Lender (or any transferee or
assignee thereof, including a participation holder (any such entity a
"TRANSFEREE")) and (ii) franchise taxes imposed on the net income of the Lender
(or Transferee), in each case by the jurisdiction under the laws of which the
Lender (or Transferee) is organized or doing business through offices or
branches located therein, or any political subdivision thereof (all such
nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities, collectively or individually, "TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to
the Lender (or any Transferee), (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the
amount (an "ADDITIONAL AMOUNT") necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 2.15) the Lender (or Transferee) shall receive an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant United States
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any current or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
("OTHER Taxes").

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender (or Transferee thereof) for the
full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes with respect to Borrower Payments paid by
the Lender (or Transferee) and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly
or legally asserted by the relevant United States Governmental Authority. A
certificate setting forth and containing an explanation in reasonable detail of
the manner in which such amount shall have been determined and the amount of
such payment or liability prepared by the Lender, absent manifest error, shall
be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such indemnification shall be
made within 30 days after the date the Lender (or Transferee) makes written
demand therefor.

     (d) If the Lender (or Transferee) shall become aware that it is entitled to
claim a refund from a United States Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower, or with
respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this
Section 2.15, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of the availability of such
refund claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the
Borrower, make a claim to such United States Governmental Authority for such
refund at the Borrower's expense. If the Lender (or Transferee) receives a
refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the preceding
sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower had paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall within 30 days from
the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower
under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender (or Transferee)
and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant United States
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the
Borrower, upon the request of the Lender (or Transferee), agrees to repay the
amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to
the Lender (or Transferee) in the event the Lender (or Transferee) is required
to repay such refund to such United States Governmental Authority.

     (e) As soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days, after the date
of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to the relevant United
States Governmental Authority, the Borrower will deliver to the Lender, at its
address referred to in Section 7.01, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such United States Governmental Authority evidencing payment
thereof.

     (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained
herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.15 shall
survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans and
reimbursement obligations made hereunder and the termination or expiry of all
Letters of Credit.

     (g) If the Lender (or Transferee) shall claim any indemnity payment or
additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall use
reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file
any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower if
the making of such a filing would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any
such indemnity payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and
would not, in the good faith determination of the Lender (or Transferee), be

                                                                              30


          (ii) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance upon
     any such capital stock existing thereon at the time of the acquisition
     thereof by the Borrower (whether or not the obligations secured thereby are
     assumed by the Borrower);

          (iii) any extension, renewal or refunding of any mortgage, pledge,
     security interest, lien or encumbrance permitted by paragraph (i) or (ii)
     above on capital stock of any Subsidiary theretofore subject thereto (or
     substantially the same capital stock) or any portion thereof; or

          (iv) any judgment, levy, execution, attachment or other similar lien
     upon such capital stock arising in connection with court proceedings,
     provided that either

               (A) the execution or enforcement of each such lien is effectively
          stayed within 30 days after entry of the corresponding judgment (or
          the corresponding judgment has been discharged within such 30 day
          period) and the claims secured thereby are being contested in good
          faith by appropriate proceedings timely commenced and diligently
          prosecuted;

               (B) the payment of each such lien is covered in full by insurance
          and the insurance company has not denied or contested coverage
          thereof; or

               (C) so long as each such lien is adequately bonded, any
          appropriate legal proceedings that may have been duly initiated for
          the review of the corresponding judgment, decree or order shall not
          have been fully terminated or the period within which such proceedings
          may be initiated shall not have expired.

     For purposes of this Section 5.10, "Indebtedness" means all indebtedness,
whether or not represented by bonds, debentures, notes or other securities,
created or assumed by the Borrower for the repayment of money borrowed. All
indebtedness for money borrowed secured by a lien upon property owned by the
Borrower and upon which indebtedness for money borrowed the Borrower customarily
pays interest, although the Borrower has not assumed or become liable for the
payment of such indebtedness for money borrowed, shall for purposes of this
Section 5.10 be deemed to be Indebtedness of the Borrower. All indebtedness of
others for money borrowed that is guaranteed as to payment of principal by the
Borrower or in effect guaranteed by the Borrower through a contingent agreement
to purchase such indebtedness for money borrowed shall for purposes of this
Section 5.10 be deemed to be Indebtedness of the Borrower, but no other
contingent obligation of the Borrower in respect of indebtedness for money
borrowed or other obligations incurred by others shall for purposes of this
Section 5.10 be deemed to be Indebtedness of the Borrower.

     In case the Borrower shall propose to pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or
grant a security interest in any capital stock of any Subsidiary owned by the
Borrower to secure any Indebtedness, other than as permitted by subsections
(a)(i) through (a)(ii), inclusive, of this Section 5.10, the Borrower will prior
thereto give written notice thereof to the Lender, and the Borrower will prior
to or simultaneously with such pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or grant of
security interest, effectively secure (for so long as such other Indebtedness
shall be so secured), in form satisfactory to the Lender, all the Commitments
and the Outstanding Credits equally and ratably with such Indebtedness and with


<PAGE>
                                                                              31


any other indebtedness for money borrowed similarly entitled to be equally and
ratably secured.

     (b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.10 shall not apply
in the event that the Borrower shall pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in or other lien upon any capital stock of any Subsidiary now
or hereafter owned by the Borrower to secure any Indebtedness that would
otherwise be subject to the foregoing restriction up to an aggregate amount
that, together with all other Indebtedness (other than mortgages, pledges,
security interests, liens or encumbrances permitted by subsection (a) of this
Section 5.10) which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restriction,
does not at the time exceed 5% of Consolidated Capitalization.

     (c) For purposes of this Section 5.10:

          (i) The term "Consolidated Capitalization" means the sum obtained by
     adding (i) Total Consolidated Shareholders' Equity, (ii) Consolidated
     Indebtedness for money borrowed (exclusive of any thereof which is due and
     payable within one year of the date such sum is determined) and, without
     duplication, (iii) any preference or preferred stock of the Borrower or any
     Consolidated Subsidiary that is subject to mandatory redemption or sinking
     fund provisions.

          (ii) The term "Total Consolidated Shareholders' Equity" means the
     total Assets of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries less all
     liabilities of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries. As used in
     this definition, "liabilities" means all obligations that would, in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, be classified on
     a balance sheet as liabilities, including without limitation, (i)
     indebtedness secured by property of the Borrower or any of its Consolidated
     Subsidiaries whether or not the Borrower or such Consolidated Subsidiary is
     liable for the payment thereof unless, in the case that the Borrower or
     such Consolidated Subsidiary is not so liable, such property has not been
     included among the Assets of the Borrower or such Consolidated Subsidiary
     on such balance sheet, (ii) deferred liabilities, (iii) indebtedness of the
     Borrower or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries that is expressly
     subordinated in right and priority of payment to other liabilities of the
     Borrower or such Consolidated Subsidiary. As used in this definition,
     "liabilities" includes preference or preferred stock of the Borrower or any
     Consolidated Subsidiary only to the extent of any such preference or
     preferred stock that is subject to mandatory redemption or sinking fund
     provisions.

          (iii) The "Assets" of any person means the whole or any part of its
     business, property, assets, cash and receivables.

          (iv) The term "Consolidated Indebtedness" means total indebtedness as
     shown on the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
     Consolidated Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 5.11. EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE RATIO.

     The Borrower will not, as of the end of each quarter of each fiscal year of
the Borrower, permit the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Expense for the twelve
months then ended to be less than 2.00 to 1.00.


<PAGE>
                                                                              32


     SECTION 5.12. CONSOLIDATED SENIOR DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO.

     The Borrower will not, as of the end of each quarter of each fiscal year of
the Borrower, permit the ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt to EBITDA for the
twelve months then ended to be greater than 6.25 to 1.00.

     SECTION 5.13. RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS.

     The Borrower will not permit Energy or Delivery to enter into any agreement
restricting the ability of Energy or Delivery to make payments, directly or
indirectly, to its shareholders by way of dividends, advances, repayments of
loans or advances, reimbursements of management and other intercompany charges,
expenses and accruals or other returns on investments or any other agreement or
arrangement that restricts the ability of Energy or Delivery to make any
payment, directly or indirectly, to its shareholders, other than pursuant to the
terms of preferred stock or Equity-Credit Preferred Securities issued by Energy
or Delivery or any of their respective Subsidiaries, if the effect of such
agreement is to subject Energy or Delivery or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to restrictions on such payments greater than those to which such
Subsidiary was subject on July 31, 2002. All such agreements to which Energy or
Delivery is a party as of the date hereof are listed in Schedule 5.13 hereto.

     SECTION 5.14. CASH COLLATERAL.

     If at any time and for so long as the Lender shall be required to provide
any collateral in the form of cash or a letter of credit (the "NEW TRUST CASH
COLLATERAL") to the "Administrative Agent" under and as defined in the New Trust
Facility to secure obligations of the Lender with respect to the Letters of
Credit and Loans arranged for the Borrower thereunder, the Borrower shall
immediately provide to the Lender, upon request by the Lender, such New Trust
Collateral.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

     In case of the happening of any of the following events (each an "EVENT OF
DEFAULT"):

     (a) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower in
or in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Loans
or Letters of Credit hereunder shall prove to have been false or misleading in
any material respect when so made, deemed made or furnished; (b) default shall
be made by the Borrower in the payment of any principal of any Loan or any
reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit when and as the same
shall become due and payable, whether at the due date thereof or at a date fixed

     (c) default shall be made by the Borrower in the payment of any interest on

other term, covenant, condition or agreement contained in any agreement or
instrument evidencing or governing any such Indebtedness if the effect of any

Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity;

     (g) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition

Section.

     SECTION 7.02. SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT.

     All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the
Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered
to have been relied upon by the Lender and shall survive the making of Loans or
arrangement for Letters of Credit by the Lender regardless of any investigation
made by the Lender or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as there are any Outstanding Credits or the LC Fee or any other
amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or the Commitment
have not been terminated or any Letter of Credit is available to be drawn.

     SECTION 7.03. BINDING EFFECT.

     Subject to Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it
shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Lender, and thereafter shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to
assign any rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior consent of
the Lender.

     SECTION 7.04. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

     (a) Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to,

that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of its

be continuing, the Lender will not agree to any assignment by any lender under
the New Trust Facility without the consent of the Borrower, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld.

                                                                              36


     SECTION 7.05. EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

     (a) The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) incurred by
the Lender in connection with entering into this Agreement or in connection with
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (but only if
such amendments, modifications or waivers are requested by the Borrower)
(whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated are consummated), or
incurred by the Lender in connection with the enforcement of its rights in
connection with this Agreement, or the Loans made and Letters of Credit arranged
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Lender in the case of enforcement following an Event of Default.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Lender against any loss,
calculated in accordance with the next sentence, or reasonable expense which the
Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) any failure by the Borrower
to borrow or to refinance, convert or continue any Loan hereunder (including as
a result of the Borrower's failure to fulfill any of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article IV) after irrevocable notice of such Loan, refinancing,
conversion or continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03, (ii) any
payment, prepayment or conversion, or assignment of a Eurodollar Loan required
by any provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date
other than the last day of the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto,
(iii) any default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any
Outstanding Credit or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when
due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity,
acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (iv) the
occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each such case, any loss or
reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred by the
Lender in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, or with respect
to Commitment made or obligations undertaken with third parties, to effect or
maintain any Loan hereunder or any part thereof as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss
shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by
the Lender, of (x) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid,
prepaid, refinanced, converted or not borrowed (assumed to be the LIBO Rate) for
the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, refinancing or failure to
borrow or refinance to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow or refinance the Interest Period for such Loan
that would have commenced on the date of such failure) over (y) the amount of
interest (as reasonably determined by the Lender) that would be realized by the
Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid or not borrowed or refinanced
for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be.

     (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Lender, each of its Affiliates and
the directors, officers, employees and agents of the foregoing (each such person
being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless
from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including reasonable counsel fees and expenses, incurred by or asserted against
any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the preparation, execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, (ii) the use of
proceeds of the Loans and Letters of Credit or (iii) any claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any
Indemnitee is a party thereto, including any of the foregoing arising from the
negligence, whether sole or concurrent, on the part of any Indemnitee; provided


<PAGE>
                                                                              37


that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (A) are
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or
(B) result from any litigation brought by such Indemnitee against the Borrower
or by the Borrower against such Indemnitee, in which a final, nonappealable
judgment has been rendered against such Indemnitee; provided, further, that the
Borrower agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
without the prior written consent of each Indemnitee, settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action,
suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification could be sought under the
indemnification provisions of this Section 7.05(c) (whether or not any
Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such claim, action, suit or
proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent does not include any
statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any Indemnitee and does not involve any payment of money or other
value by any Indemnitee or any injunctive relief or factual findings or
stipulations binding on any Indemnitee.

     (d) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse and indemnify the Lender upon
demand for all costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with
providing the Commitment, the funding of the Loans and the procurement of the
Letters of Credit, including, without limitation, all such costs and expenses
relating to any obligation of the Lender to secure its repayment obligations
with respect to money borrowed to fund the Loans and its reimbursement
obligations with respect to the Letters of Credit.

     (e) The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in full force
and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of
the Outstanding Credits, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Lender. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable on written demand
therefor.

     (f) A certificate of the Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which
the Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to subsection (b) or (d) of this
Section and containing an explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in
which such amount or amounts shall have been determined shall be delivered to
the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     SECTION 7.06. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF THE TRUSTEE.

     It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that (i) this document
is executed and delivered by Wilmington Trust Company, not individually or
personally, but solely as Trustee, in the exercise of the powers and authority
conferred and vested in it pursuant to the Trust Agreement (LOC 2003 TRUST),
dated July 28, 2003, between Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, and the
Borrower, as beneficial owner, (ii) each of the representations, undertakings
and agreements herein made on the part of the Lender is made and intended not as
a personal representation, undertaking and agreement by Wilmington Trust Company
but is made and intended for the purpose for binding only the Lender, (iii)
nothing herein contained shall be construed as creating any liability on
Wilmington Trust Company, individually or personally, to perform any covenant,
either expressed or implied, contained herein, all such liability, if any, being


<PAGE>
                                                                              38


expressly waived by the parties hereto and by any person claiming by, through or
under the parties hereto, and (iv) under no circumstances shall Wilmington Trust
Company be personally liable for the payment of any indebtedness or expenses of
the Lender or be liable for the breach or failure of any obligation,
representation, warranty or covenant made or undertaken by the Lender under this
Agreement or any other related documents.

     SECTION 7.07. RIGHT OF SETOFF.

     If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lender is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at
any time owing by the Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by the Lender, irrespective of whether or not the
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of the Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
the Lender may have.

     SECTION 7.08. APPLICABLE LAW.

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     SECTION 7.09. WAIVERS; AMENDMENT.

     (a) No failure or delay of the Lender in exercising any power or right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of
the Lender hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be permitted by subsection (b) below, and then such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose
for which given. No notice or demand on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in

or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Borrower and the Lender.

parties hereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.11. SEVERABILITY.

     In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in
good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

     SECTION 7.12. COUNTERPARTS.

     This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section
7.03.

     SECTION 7.13. HEADINGS.

     Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for
convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.14. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the
applicable interest rate, together with all fees and charges that are treated as
interest under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), as provided for
herein or in any other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise
contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by the Lender, shall exceed
the maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") that may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender in accordance with applicable
law, the rate of interest payable on the Outstanding Credits, together with all
Charges payable to the Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

     (b) If the amount of interest, together with all Charges, payable for the
account of the Lender in respect of any interest computation period is reduced
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section and the amount of interest, together
with all Charges, payable for the Lender's account in respect of any subsequent
interest computation period, computed pursuant to Section 2.07, would be less
than the Maximum Rate, then the amount of interest, together with all Charges,
payable for the Lender's account in respect of such subsequent interest
computation period shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
automatically increased to such Maximum Rate; provided that at no time shall the
aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of the Lender has been
increased pursuant to this subsection (b) exceed the aggregate amount by which
interest, together with all Charges, paid for its account has theretofore been
reduced pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section.

     SECTION 7.15. JURISDICTION; VENUE.

     (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court
or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Subject to the foregoing and to subsection (b) below, nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any right that any party hereto may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any other party hereto
in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or thereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

     SECTION 7.16. CONFIDENTIALITY.

     The Lender shall use its best efforts to hold in confidence all
information, memoranda, or extracts furnished to the Lender by the Borrower
hereunder or in connection with the negotiation hereof; provided that the Lender
may disclose any such information, memoranda or extracts (i) to its Affiliates,
accountants or counsel, (ii) to any regulatory agency having authority to
examine the Lender, (iii) as required by any legal or governmental process or
otherwise by law, (iv) except as provided in the last sentence of Section 5.03,
to any person to which the Lender sells or proposes to sell an assignment or a
participation in its Outstanding Credits hereunder, if such other person agrees
for the benefit of the Borrower to comply with the provisions of this Section
and (v) to the extent that such information, memoranda or extracts shall be
publicly available or shall have become known to the Lender independently of any
disclosure by the Borrower hereunder or in connection with the negotiation
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender may disclose the provisions of
this Agreement and the amounts, maturities and interest rates of its Loans to
any purchaser or potential purchaser of the Lender's interest in any Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and the Lender (and each officer,
director, employee, representative, agent and advisor of each party hereto) may
disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated by this letter and
all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such "tax treatment" and "tax structure".
The foregoing is intended to comply with the presumption set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(iii) and should be interpreted in a manner
consistent with such regulation.
