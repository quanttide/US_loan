              OUTLOOK GROUP REPORTS IMPROVED SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

NEENAH, WIS., DECEMBER 20, 2004.....Outlook Group Corp. (Nasdaq: OUTL) today
reported increased sales and earnings for the second quarter ended November 27,
2004.

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $19,738,000, a 2.0%
increase from sales of $19,342,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Net
earnings were $1,278,000 or $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter of
fiscal 2005, compared to net earnings of $555,000 or $0.16 per diluted share for
the same period in the prior year. The net earnings for the second quarter of
fiscal 2005 include a previously disclosed pre-tax recovery of bad debt of
$1,214,000 related to a note that was written off in prior years.

For the first half of fiscal 2005, net sales were $36,945,000, a 1.5% increase
from sales of $36,403,000 for the same period in the prior year. Net earnings
were $1,981,000 or $0.58 per diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2005,
compared to net earnings of $348,000 or $0.10 per diluted share for the same
period in the prior fiscal year.

"Sales increased in the second quarter and, excluding the debt recovery, we were
able to maintain earnings at a steady level in spite of significant increases in
materials costs that have affected us and other companies in our industry.
Margins for the quarter were also impacted by start-up costs related to a new
supply chain client," said Joseph J. Baksha, president and chief operating
officer of Outlook Group.

Baksha said the company added a new press in its label operation during the
second quarter. "The new press enhances our capabilities and increases
efficiency. Our ongoing investments in new equipment and production processes
make us a strong competitor and improve productivity, as reflected by our steady
increases in sales per employee," said Baksha.

"As we announced last week, the Outlook Group Board of Directors has approved a
20% increase in our quarterly dividend payment to $0.06 per share. The increase
reflects the progress we have made through our focus on long-term supply chain
management contracts and our commitment to providing value for our
shareholders," said Richard C. Fischer, chairman and chief executive officer of
Outlook Group.

"It appears that the industry is beginning to show signs of improvement,
although increasing raw materials costs and price competition remain a
challenge. We are continuing to pursue opportunities for new long-term contracts
that will contribute to our future growth," said Baksha.

Outlook Group Corp. is a printing, packaging and direct marketing company
offering a variety of related services to clients in markets including contract
packaging, collateral information management and distribution, direct marketing
components and services, packaging components and materials and specialty print
related services. The company leverages its core competencies by cross-selling
services to provide a single-source solution for its clients.

The discussions of potential future occurrences and operations, and other
statements in the future tense or using terms such as "believe," "expect," or
"anticipate," in this press release are "forward-looking statements" intended to
qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to
certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ
materially from those anticipated. Outlook's periodic filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission discuss a number of other factors which may
affect Outlook's future operations, including: possible changes in customer
relationships; financing needs to support our relationships; possible
termination of contracts, including long-term contracts; the need to complete
the transitions to the new customer contracts, and the need to achieve and
maintain satisfactory performance thereunder; potential inability to achieve
expected cost savings or delays in their achievement; changes in project mix and
timing; the effects of industry competition, overcapacity and acquisition
activity; slowdowns in general market and economic conditions, and changes in
other world and national conditions; and the possible need for future capital
investments or equipment enhancements, and related financing. Readers are urged
to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking
statements.
