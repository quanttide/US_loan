ITEM 4.02 NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

On December 1, 2004 the World Associates, Inc. (Company) filed its quarterly
filing on Form 10QSB for the period ended September 30, 2004.  While preparing
the financial statements for that filing, the Company became aware of errors
that required correction.  After discussion with its auditors it was agreed to
incorporate those changes in the above filing, as follows:

The following information is presented in paragraph (J) to NOTE 1 of the
condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30,
2004.  It specifies the errors that were corrected and the periods effected.

     1.  In the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2004 the  "Gain on settlement" line for the six
months ended June 30, 2004, was adjusted downward by $300,000 due to an error in
calculating the gain that did not include $300,000 in debt against one property
involved in the settlement.  The adjusted gain amount as of June 30, 2004 is
$4,632,230.  The adjusted amount is correctly reflected in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2004.

     2.  In the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2004 the  "Preferred dividends" line for the six
months ended June 30, 2004, was adjusted downward by $23,250 to zero and that
same amount was added to the "Dividend and interest and income (expense) net"
line due to the fact that Series G was reclassified as debt starting in January
2004.

The sum of the above adjustments had the net effect of reducing net income for
the six months ended June 30, 2004 by $323,250, but had no effect on earnings
per share for the six months then ended.

     3.  In the condensed consolidated balance sheet land as of June 30, 2004,
was decreased by $600,000 with a corresponding reduction in paid in capital.
There was no affect on net income.  This adjustment was necessary due to an
error in calculating the effect of a recent settlement.  (The details on that
settlement are provided in NOTE 3 of the condensed consolidated statements for
the period ended September 30, 2004.)

The Board of Directors authorized these corrections and Weinberg and Company,
World Associates, Inc.'s independent auditors, have reviewed the above
corrections prior the Company's quarterly filing.
