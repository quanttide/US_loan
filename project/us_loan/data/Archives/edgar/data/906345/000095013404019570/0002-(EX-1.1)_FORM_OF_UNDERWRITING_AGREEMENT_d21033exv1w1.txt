Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Camden Property Trust, a Texas real estate investment trust (the
"Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule I
hereto (the "Underwriters") the respective principal amounts of its debt
securities identified in Schedule I hereto (collectively, the "Securities"), to
be issued under the indenture specified in Schedule I hereto (including the
Supplemental Indenture referred to in Schedule I, the "Indenture") between the
Company and the Trustee identified in such Schedule I (the "Trustee").

         The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with the provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration
statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on Form
S-3, relating to certain securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from
time to time by the Company. The Company also has filed with, or proposes to
file with, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a
prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities. The registration
statement as amended to the date of this Agreement is hereinafter referred to as
the "Registration Statement" and the related prospectus covering the Shelf
Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is
hereinafter referred to as the "Base Prospectus." The Base Prospectus as
supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically

relating to the Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the
Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus." Any reference in this
Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary
form of Prospectus (a "preliminary prospectus") previously filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to
and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12
of Form S-3 under the Securities Act which were filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") on or before the date
of this Agreement or the date of the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus
or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to "amend," "amendment"
or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus,
any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
include any filing of documents under, or any documents filed under, the
Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the date of the Base
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be,
which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

         The Company hereby agrees with the Underwriters as follows:

         1.       The Company agrees to issue and sell the Securities to the
several Underwriters as hereinafter provided, and each Underwriter, on the basis
of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the
conditions hereinafter stated, agrees to purchase, severally and not jointly,
from the Company the principal amount of Securities at the purchase price set
forth in Schedule I hereto plus accrued interest, if any, from the date
specified in Schedule I hereto to the date of payment and delivery.

         2.       The Company understands that the Underwriters intend (i) to
make a public offering of the Securities and (ii) initially to offer the
Securities upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.

         3.       Payment for the Securities shall be made to the Company or to
its order in immediately available funds on the date and at the time and place
set forth in Schedule I hereto (or at such other time and place on the same or
such other date, not later than the third Business Day thereafter, as the
Underwriters and the Company may agree in writing). Such payment will be made
upon delivery to such Underwriters of the Securities registered in such names
and in such denominations as the Underwriters shall request not less than one
full Business Day prior to the date of delivery, with any transfer taxes payable
in connection with transfer to the Underwriters duly paid by the Company. As
used herein, the term "Business Day" means any day other than a day on which
banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City. The time and date
of such payment and delivery with respect to the Securities are referred to
herein as the Closing Date. The certificates for the Securities will be made
available for inspection and packaging by the Underwriters by 1:00 P.M. on the
Business Day prior to the Closing Date at such place in New York City as the
Underwriters and the Company shall agree.

         4.       The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter as of

         supplements thereto) comply, or will comply, as the case may be, in all
         material respects with the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act
         of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission
         thereunder (collectively, the "Trust Indenture Act"); and the
         Registration Statement does not and will not, as of its applicable
         effective date and any amendment thereto and at the date hereof and at
         the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
         omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

         materials, if any, permitted by the Securities Act;

                  (t)      no relationship, direct or indirect, exists between
         or among any of the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
         any trust managers, officer, shareholder, customer or supplier of the

         Registration Statement and the Prospectus;

                  (u)      the Company maintains a system of internal accounting
         controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i)
         transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
         specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
         permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and
         to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to financial and
         corporate books and records is permitted only in accordance with
         management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded

         restrictions on or affecting the Properties which are required to be

         the Company, (i) no lessee of any portion of any of the Properties is
         in default under any of the leases governing such properties and there
         is no event which, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice,
         or both, would constitute a default under any of such leases, except
         such defaults that would not have a material adverse effect on the
         condition (financial or other), business, prospects, net worth or
         results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a
         whole; (ii) the intended use and occupancy of each of the Properties
         complies with all applicable codes and zoning laws and regulations, if

         operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and
         (iii) there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
         threatened condemnation, zoning change, environmental or other
         proceeding or action that will in any material respect affect the size
         of, use of, improvements on, construction on, or access to the
         Properties, except such proceedings or actions that would not have a
         material adverse effect on the condition (financial or other),

                  (w)      the Company has, and will maintain, property and
         casualty insurance in favor of the Company and the Subsidiaries, as the
         case may be, with respect to each of the Properties, in an amount and
         on such terms as is reasonable and customary for businesses of the type
         proposed to be conducted by the Company and the Subsidiaries; the
         Company has not received from any insurance company written notice of
         any material defects or deficiencies affecting the insurability of any
         such Properties; and

                  (x)      any certificate signed by any officer of the Company
         and delivered to the Underwriters or to counsel for the Underwriters in
         connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a
         representation and warranty by the Company to the Underwriters as to
         the matters covered thereby on the date of such certificate.

         5.       The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters
as follows:

                  (a)      to file the Prospectus (but only if the Underwriters
         have not reasonably objected thereto by notice to the Company after
         having been furnished a copy in reasonable time prior to filing)
         pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act not later than the
         Commission's close of business on the second Business Day following the
         date of determination of the offering price of the Securities;

                  (b)      to deliver to each Underwriter and counsel for the
         Underwriters, at the expense of the Company, a copy of the signed
         Registration Statement (as originally filed) and each amendment
         thereto, in each case including exhibits and, upon request, documents
         incorporated by reference therein and, during the period mentioned in
         paragraph (e) below, as many copies of the Prospectus (including all
         amendments and supplements thereto) and documents incorporated by
         reference therein as the Underwriters may reasonably request, when
         filed with the Commission; and that each such Prospectus will, at the
         time of such delivery, be identical to any electronically transmitted
         copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to
         the extent permitted by Regulation S-T;

                  (c)      from the date hereof and during such period after the
         first date of the public offering of the Securities that, in the
         opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, a prospectus relating to the
         Securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales
         by an Underwriter or a dealer, to furnish to the Underwriters a copy of
         any proposed amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
         the Prospectus, for the Underwriters' review, and not to file any such
         proposed amendment or supplement to which the Underwriters reasonably
         object;

                  (d)      to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy
         or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the
         Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the
         Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in
         connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such
         same period, to advise the Underwriters promptly, and to confirm such
         advice in writing, (i)


                                       10
<PAGE>


         when any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have become
         effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to
         the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the
         Prospectus or for any additional information, (iii) of the issuance by
         the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
         Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any
         proceeding for that purpose, and (iv) of the receipt by the Company of
         any notification with respect to any suspension of the qualification of
         the Securities for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation
         or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and to use its best
         efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notification
         and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof;

                  (e)      if, during such period after the first date of the
         public offering of the Securities, in the opinion of counsel for the
         Underwriters, a prospectus relating to the Securities is required by
         law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or a
         dealer, any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary to
         amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is
         delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to
         amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, forthwith to
         prepare and, subject to Section 5(c), furnish, at the expense of the
         Company, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and
         addresses the Underwriters will furnish to the Company) to which
         Securities may have been sold by the Underwriters and to any other
         dealers upon request, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus
         as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus as so
         amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances
         when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so
         that the Prospectus will comply with law;

                  (f)      to endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and
         sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the
         Underwriters shall reasonably request and to continue such
         qualification in effect so long as reasonably required for distribution
         of the Securities and to pay all fees and expenses (including fees and
         disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters) reasonably incurred in
         connection with such qualification and in connection with the
         determination of the eligibility of the Securities for investment under
         the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate;
         provided that the Company shall not be required to file a general
         consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

                  (g)      to make generally available to its security holders
         and to the Underwriters as soon as practicable but not later than 18

         least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the
         Company occurring after the effective date of the Registration
         Statement, which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
         Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder;

                  (h)      so long as the Securities are outstanding, to furnish
         to the Underwriters copies of all reports or other communications
         (financial or other) furnished to holders of


                                       11

         furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities
         exchange;

         of Proceeds";

                  (j)      to use its best efforts to continue to meet the
         requirements to qualify as a REIT under the Code for the taxable year

         specified in the Prospectus;

                  (k)      during the period beginning on the date hereof and
         continuing to and including the Business Day following the Closing
         Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any
         debt securities of or guaranteed by the Company which are substantially
         similar to the Securities without the Underwriters' prior written
         consent; and

                  (l)      to pay all costs and expenses incident to the
         performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limiting

         thereto), (iii) incurred in connection with the registration or

<PAGE>


         information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with
         to the Underwriters' satisfaction;

                  (c)      subsequent to the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have occurred
         any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of (i) any
         intended or potential downgrading or (ii) any review or possible change
         that indicates anything other than a stable outlook, in the rating
         accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any
         "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term
         is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; and

         properties, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of
         operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the
         effect of which in the judgment of the Underwriters makes it
         impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
         delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated
         in the Prospectus;

                  (e)      the Underwriters shall have received on and as of the

         forth in subsections (a) through (c) of this Section and to the further
         effect that there has not occurred any material adverse change, or any
         development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or
         affecting the general affairs, business, prospects, management,
         properties, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of
         operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole from
         that set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement;

                  validly existing as a real estate investment trust under the

                  conducts any business, so as to require such qualification,
                  other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good
                  standing would not have a material adverse effect on the
                  general affairs, business prospects, management, properties,

                  where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would
                  not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its
                  Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                           (v)      other than as set forth or contemplated in
                  the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental
                  investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to

                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be a party or to
                  which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
                  is or may be the subject which, if determined adversely to the
                  Company or such Subsidiary, could individually or in the
                  aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
                  Effect; to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such
                  proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental
                  authorities or threatened by others; and such counsel does not
                  know of any contracts or other documents of a character
                  required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration

                           (vi)     this Agreement has been duly authorized,
                  executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and
                  binding agreement of the Company on the date hereof, except as

                  Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,

                  moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter existing
                  which affect the rights and remedies of creditors generally

                  and binding instrument of the Company enforceable in
                  accordance with its terms, except that the enforceability
                  thereof may be limited by or be subject to (a) bankruptcy,

                  Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture
                  Act;

                           (ix)     to the best of such counsel's knowledge,
                  neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries are, nor with the
                  giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be, in

                  other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which
                  the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which
                  they or any of their respective properties are bound, except
                  for violations and defaults which individually and in the
                  aggregate are not material to the Company or to the holders of
                  the Securities; the issue and sale of the Securities and the

                  consummation of the transactions herein and therein
                  contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of
                  any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
                  under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement

                  by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or to which
                  any of the property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary
                  is subject, nor will any such action result in any violation
                  of the provisions of the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws
                  of the Company or any applicable law or statute or any order,
                  rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body
                  having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties;

                  with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the
                  Underwriters;

                           (xii)    the statements in the Prospectus under the
                  captions "Description of Capital Shares," "Description of

                  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and
                  in the Registration Statement insofar as such statements
                  constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or
                  proceedings referred to therein, in each case fairly present
                  the information called for with respect to such legal matters,
                  documents or proceedings; the descriptions in the Registration
                  Statement and Prospectus of contracts and other documents
                  which are filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement are
                  accurate in all material respects and fairly present the
                  information required to be shown; and to such counsel's
                  knowledge there are no statutes or legal or governmental
                  proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus that
                  are not described as required;

                           (xiii)   the Company is not, and will not become as a
                  result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement, an "investment company" within the meaning of

                  dated as of January 7, 2000, there are no contracts,
                  agreements or understandings between the Company and any
                  person granting such person the right to require the Company
                  to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with
                  respect to any securities of the Company owned by such person,
                  and (ii) no person has the right to require the Company to
                  register such securities pursuant to the Registration
                  Statement;

                           (xv)     the Registration Statement has become
                  effective under the Securities Act; any required filing of the
                  Prospectus under Rule 424 under the Securities Act has been
                  made; to the best knowledge of such counsel no stop order
                  suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has
                  been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been
                  instituted or threatened by the Commission;

                           (xvi)    such counsel (A) is of the opinion that each
                  document incorporated by reference in the Registration
                  Statement and the Prospectus (except for the financial
                  statements included therein as to which such counsel need
                  express no opinion) complied as to form in all material
                  respects with the Exchange Act when filed with the Commission,
                  (B) believes that (except for the financial statements
                  included therein as to which such counsel need express no
                  belief) the Registration Statement (including the documents
                  incorporated by reference therein) filed with the Commission
                  pursuant to the Securities Act relating to the Securities, at
                  the time of filing the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended
                  December 31, 2003 with the Commission, did not contain an
                  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
                  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
                  make the statements therein not misleading, (C) is of the
                  opinion that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and
                  any amendments and supplements thereto (except for the
                  financial statement included therein as to which such counsel
                  need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material
                  respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
                  Trust Indenture Act and (D) believes that (except for the
                  financial statements included therein as to which such counsel
                  need express no belief) the Registration Statement and the
                  Prospectus, on the date of this Agreement and as of the
                  Closing Date, did not contain any untrue statement of a
                  material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
                  stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
                  misleading, and that the Prospectus as amended or
                  supplemented, if applicable, does not contain any untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
                  necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
                  light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
                  misleading.

                  In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to
         matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the
         United States and the State of Texas, to the extent such counsel deems
         proper and to the extent specified in such opinion, if at all, upon an
         opinion or opinions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
         the Underwriters' counsel) of other counsel reasonably acceptable to
         the Underwriters' counsel, familiar with the applicable laws; (B) as to
         matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deems proper, on
         certificates of responsible officers of the Company and


                                       17
<PAGE>


         certificates or other written statements of officials of jurisdictions
         having custody of documents respecting the corporate existence or good
         standing of the Company. The opinion of such counsel for the Company
         shall state that the opinion of any such other counsel is in form
         satisfactory to such counsel and, in such counsel's opinion, the
         Underwriters and they are justified in relying thereon. With respect to
         the matters to be covered in subparagraph (xvi) above counsel may state
         its opinion and belief is based upon their participation in the
         preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any
         amendment or supplement thereto (other than the documents incorporated
         by reference therein) and review and discussion of the contents thereof
         (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) but is
         without independent check or verification except as specified.

                  (g)      Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, tax counsel for the
         Company, shall have delivered to the Underwriters its written opinion,
         dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Underwriters, to the effect that:

                           (i)      the Company met the requirements for
                  qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust
                  ("REIT") for the taxable years 1993 through 2003;

                           (ii)     the Company's diversity of equity ownership
                  and proposed method of operation should allow it to qualify as
                  a REIT for its 2004 taxable year; and

                           (iii)    the discussion contained under the caption
                  "Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your
                  Investment" and "Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the
                  Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement,
                  accurately reflects existing law and fairly addresses the
                  material federal income tax issues described therein.

                  In rendering such opinions, Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP may rely
         as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates
         of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel
         states that no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which
         lead them to believe that they are not justified in relying on such
         certificates. In addition, Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP may state that
         their opinions are based upon the procedures and assumptions set forth
         in such opinion letter and that it is limited to the tax matters
         specifically covered thereby and that they have not addressed any other
         tax consequences.

                  (h)      concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement, or on the Closing Date prior to payment and delivery of the
         Securities, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the
         Underwriters a letter, dated the date of its delivery, addressed to the
         Underwriters and in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Underwriters, confirming that they are an independent registered public
         accounting firm with respect to the Company as required by the
         Securities Act and with respect to the financial statements and certain
         financial and other statistical and numerical information contained in
         the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or incorporated by
         reference therein. Such letter shall contain information of the type
         customarily included in accountants' comfort letters to underwriters.
         If such letter is delivered as of the date of this Agreement,


                                       18
<PAGE>


         then at the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to
         the Underwriters a letter, dated the date of its delivery, which shall
         confirm, on the basis of a review in accordance with the procedures set
         forth in such letter, that nothing has come to their attention during
         the period from the date of the letter referred to in the prior
         sentence to a date (specified in the letter) not more than three days
         prior to the Closing Date which would require any change in their
         letter dated the date hereof if it were required to be dated and
         delivered at the Closing Date;

                  (i)      the Underwriters shall have received on and as of the
         Closing Date an opinion of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for
         the Underwriters, with respect to the validity of the Indenture and the
         Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other
         related matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request, and such
         counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may
         reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; Sidley
         Austin Brown & Wood LLP may rely upon the opinion of Locke Liddell &
         Sapp LLP as to matters of Texas law; and

                  (j)      on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
         have furnished to the Underwriters such further certificates and
         documents confirming the representations and warranties contained
         herein and related matters as the Underwriters shall reasonably
         request.

         The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all
material respects satisfactory to the Underwriters and their counsel.

         7.       The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the
meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including without limitation the reasonable legal fees and other expenses
(including expenses of investigation and settlement) incurred in connection with
any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the
Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any
preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Company in writing by
such Underwriter expressly for use therein; provided, that the foregoing
indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling such
Underwriter) if such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission made in such preliminary prospectus is eliminated or remedied in the
Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto) and, if required by law, a copy of the
Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) shall not have been furnished to such
person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities at or prior to
the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person.


                                       19
<PAGE>


         Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its trust managers, its officers who sign the
Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act,
to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each
Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter
furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or
any preliminary prospectus.

         If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or
regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against
any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the
two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly
notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying
Person") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the
Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person
to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees
and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding,
any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have
mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within
a reasonable time to retain counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or
(iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the
Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified
Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are
incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters and any such control
persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters and
any such separate firm for the Company, its trust managers, its officers who
sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or
authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The
Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to
indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person
to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as
contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person
agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30
days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii)
such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in
accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No
Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity
could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii)
does not include a


                                       20
<PAGE>


statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

         If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs
of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then
each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred
to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one
hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed
to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering
of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the
total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters
bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the
Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

         The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses,
claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an
Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed
to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that
such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligation to
contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their
respective underwriting commitments as set forth in Schedule I hereto and not
joint.


                                       21
<PAGE>


         The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7
are in addition to any liability which the Indemnifying Persons may otherwise
have to the Indemnified Persons referred to above.

         The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7
and the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
(i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on
behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling
the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.

         8.       Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may
be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters, by notice given to
the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at
or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be
performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations
hereunder is not fulfilled, (iii) there shall have occurred, since the
respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus, any material adverse change or any development involving a
prospective material adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, business affairs, properties,
management or business prospects of the Company, whether or not arising in the
ordinary course of business, (iv) trading generally shall have been suspended or
materially limited on or by the New York Stock Exchange, (v) trading of any
securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any
exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (vi) a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities in New York or Texas shall have been declared by
either Federal, Texas or New York State authorities; or there shall have
occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or
clearance services in the United States, (vii) there has occurred any
downgrading or notice of any intended or potential downgrading or any review or
possible change that indicates anything other than a stable outlook in the
rating of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized
statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2)
under the Securities Act) or (viii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the
United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other
calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions
in the United States that, in the judgment of the Underwriters, is material and
adverse and which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes it impracticable
or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities
on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

         9.       If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters
shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to
purchase under this Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities
which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused
to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the
proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their
respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of
Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters,
or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the
Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed


                                       22
<PAGE>


or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the
principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase
pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in
excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written
consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or
Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate
principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more
than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased,
and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the
purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default,
this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any
non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the
Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date,
but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes,
if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other
documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph
shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any
default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

         10.      If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or
any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to
comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or
if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any condition of the Underwriters' obligations cannot be
fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters
as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for
all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their
counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this
Agreement or the offering of Securities contemplated hereunder.

         11.      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Company, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein
and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in
this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm
or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect
of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Securities
from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such
purchase.

         12.      All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by
any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be
given at c/o Banc of America Securities LLC, 40 West 57th Street, NY1-040-27-01,

         13.      Miscellaneous. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts,
each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
