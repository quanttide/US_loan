CUSIP No.: 133131 AN 2

         CAMDEN PROPERTY TRUST, a real estate investment trust organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Texas (hereinafter called the "Company,"
which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter
referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or
registered assigns, upon presentation, the principal sum of Two Hundred and
Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000) on January 15, 2010 at the office or agency
of the Company referred to below, and to pay interest thereon from December 20,
2004, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been
paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 in
each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing July 15, 2005 at the
rate of 4.375% per annum, until the entire principal hereof is paid or duly
provided for. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for
on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided for in the Indenture, be paid to
the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities)
is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest which shall be January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as
the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of
such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be
given to Holders of Securities of this series not more than 15 days and not less
than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in
any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such
notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the
Indenture.

         Payment of the principal of, or Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest
on, the Securities will be made to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee
in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of
payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided,
however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by
(i) check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address
shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer of funds to an
account of the Person entitled thereto maintained within the United States.

         Securities of this series may be redeemed at any time at the option of
the Company, in whole or in part, upon notice of not more than 60 nor less than
30 days prior to the Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to the sum of

                              4.375% NOTE DUE 2010


         This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more
series under an Indenture, dated as of February 11, 2003, (herein called the
"Indenture"), between the Company and SunTrust Bank, a banking corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Georgia, as Trustee
(herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under
the Indenture with respect to the series of which this Security is a part), to
which Indenture and all board resolutions and indentures supplemental thereto
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations
of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and
are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series
designated on the first page hereof.

         "Make-Whole Amount" means, in connection with any optional redemption
or accelerated payment of any Security, the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate
present value as of the date of such redemption or accelerated payment of each
dollar of principal being redeemed or paid and the amount of interest (exclusive
of interest accrued to the date of redemption or accelerated payment) that would
have been payable in respect of such dollar if such redemption or accelerated
payment had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semi-annual basis,
such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate (determined on the third
Business Day preceding the date such notice of redemption is given or
declaration of acceleration is made) from the respective dates on which such
principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption or accelerated
payment had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities being redeemed or paid.

         "Reinvestment Rate" means 0.15% (fifteen one-hundredths of one percent)
plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the respective headings "This Week"
and "Last Week" published in the Statistical Release under the caption "Treasury
Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month)
corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the payment date of the
principal being redeemed or paid. If no maturity exactly corresponds to such
maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to
such maturity shall be calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
and the Reinvestment Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields
on a straight-line basis, rounding in each of such relevant periods to the
nearest month. For purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most
recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the
Make-Whole Amount shall be used.

         "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designated
"H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the
Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United
States government securities adjusted to constant maturities or, if such
statistical release is not published at the time of any determination under the
Indenture, then such other reasonably comparable index which shall be designated
by the Company.

         The covenants set forth in Section 10.12 of the Indenture shall be
fully applicable to this Security.

         The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the
entire indebtedness of the Company on this Security and (b) certain restrictive
covenants and the related defaults and Events of Default applicable to the
Company, in each case, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions
set forth in the Indenture, which provisions apply to this Security.

         If any Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of, and the Make-Whole Amount, if any,
on, the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner
and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

         As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a


                                       3
<PAGE>


continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this
series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to
institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee, offered
the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at
the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and the Trustee
shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of
such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to
any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any
payment of principal hereof (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or any
interest on and any Additional Amounts in respect thereof on or after the
respective due dates expressed herein.

         The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding affected thereby. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive
compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain
past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu
hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if
any, on, and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any Place of Payment where the principal of,
Make-Whole Amount, if any, on, and interest on this Security are payable, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or
more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

         The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth,
Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount
of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as
requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

         No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement
contained in the Indenture or in this Security, or because of any indebtedness
evidenced thereby, shall be had against any promoter, as such or, against any
past, present or future shareholder, officer, trust manager or director, as
such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company
or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or
by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or
otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the
acceptance of this Security by the Holder thereof and as part of the
consideration for the issue of the Securities of this series.

         All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
