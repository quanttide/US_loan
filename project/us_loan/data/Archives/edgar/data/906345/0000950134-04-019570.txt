<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 </B>&nbsp;<B>Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2004, Camden Property Trust, a Texas real estate investment trust (the
&#147;Company&#148;), entered into an underwriting agreement (the &#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;) with Banc of
America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, PNC Capital Markets, Inc., SunTrust Capital
Markets, Inc., Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Wells Fargo Brokerage Services, LLC (the
&#147;Underwriters&#148;) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters
$250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% Notes due 2010 (the &#147;Notes&#148;), which issuance
and sale closed on December&nbsp;20, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offering of the Notes is described in the Company&#146;s Prospectus Supplement dated December
15, 2004 to the Company&#146;s Prospectus dated February&nbsp;25, 2003. The Notes were issued pursuant to
the Company&#146;s existing shelf registration statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notes bear interest at 4.375% from December&nbsp;20, 2004, with interest payable each January
15 and July&nbsp;15 beginning July&nbsp;15, 2005. The entire principal amount of the Notes is due on January
15, 2010. The Notes are redeemable at any time at the option of the Company, in whole or in part,
at a redemption price equal to the principal amount and accrued interest of the Notes being
redeemed, plus a make-whole premium.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notes were priced at a discount such that the Notes were offered to the public at 99.947%
of their face amount. The Notes were issued under an Indenture between the Company and SunTrust
Bank, as trustee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $248.3&nbsp;million from the sale of
the Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and other expenses, to repay an equal amount
of the outstanding balance on its unsecured line of credit. Affiliates of some of the Underwriters
are lenders under the line of credit and, upon application of the net proceeds from the offering of
the Notes, each will receive its proportionate share of the amount of the line of credit to be
repaid. In October&nbsp;2004, the Company received a commitment for a $500&nbsp;million bridge facility from
an affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC with a term of 364&nbsp;days at an interest rate based on
LIBOR plus 90 basis points, which rate is subject to certain conditions. In addition, in the
ordinary course of their respective businesses, the Underwriters and their affiliates have engaged,
and may in the future engage, in other commercial banking and/or investment banking transactions
with the Company and its affiliates for which they have received, and will in the future receive,
customary fees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description herein of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety, and the
terms therein are incorporated herein, by reference to the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit
1.1 hereto.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Camden Property Trust, a Texas real estate investment trust (the
"Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule I
hereto (the "Underwriters") the respective principal amounts of its debt
securities identified in Schedule I hereto (collectively, the "Securities"), to
be issued under the indenture specified in Schedule I hereto (including the
Supplemental Indenture referred to in Schedule I, the "Indenture") between the
Company and the Trustee identified in such Schedule I (the "Trustee").

         The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with the provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration
statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on Form
S-3, relating to certain securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from
time to time by the Company. The Company also has filed with, or proposes to
file with, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a
prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities. The registration
statement as amended to the date of this Agreement is hereinafter referred to as
the "Registration Statement" and the related prospectus covering the Shelf
Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is
hereinafter referred to as the "Base Prospectus." The Base Prospectus as
supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically


<PAGE>


relating to the Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the
Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus." Any reference in this
Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary
form of Prospectus (a "preliminary prospectus") previously filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to
and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12
of Form S-3 under the Securities Act which were filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") on or before the date
of this Agreement or the date of the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus
or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to "amend," "amendment"
or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus,
any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
include any filing of documents under, or any documents filed under, the
Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the date of the Base
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be,
which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

         The Company hereby agrees with the Underwriters as follows:

         1.       The Company agrees to issue and sell the Securities to the
several Underwriters as hereinafter provided, and each Underwriter, on the basis
of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the
conditions hereinafter stated, agrees to purchase, severally and not jointly,
from the Company the principal amount of Securities at the purchase price set
forth in Schedule I hereto plus accrued interest, if any, from the date
specified in Schedule I hereto to the date of payment and delivery.

         2.       The Company understands that the Underwriters intend (i) to
make a public offering of the Securities and (ii) initially to offer the
Securities upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.

         3.       Payment for the Securities shall be made to the Company or to
its order in immediately available funds on the date and at the time and place
set forth in Schedule I hereto (or at such other time and place on the same or
such other date, not later than the third Business Day thereafter, as the
Underwriters and the Company may agree in writing). Such payment will be made
upon delivery to such Underwriters of the Securities registered in such names
and in such denominations as the Underwriters shall request not less than one
full Business Day prior to the date of delivery, with any transfer taxes payable
in connection with transfer to the Underwriters duly paid by the Company. As
used herein, the term "Business Day" means any day other than a day on which
banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City. The time and date
of such payment and delivery with respect to the Securities are referred to
herein as the Closing Date. The certificates for the Securities will be made
available for inspection and packaging by the Underwriters by 1:00 P.M. on the
Business Day prior to the Closing Date at such place in New York City as the
Underwriters and the Company shall agree.

                  (r)      none of the assets of the Company or the Subsidiaries
         constitute, nor will such assets, as of the Closing Date, constitute,
         "plan assets" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
         1974, as amended ("ERISA");

                  (s)      the Company has not distributed and, prior to the
         later to occur of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) completion of the
         distribution of the Securities, will not distribute any offering
         material in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities
         other than the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or other
         materials, if any, permitted by the Securities Act;

                  (t)      no relationship, direct or indirect, exists between
         or among any of the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
         any trust managers, officer, shareholder, customer or supplier of the
         Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, which is required by
         the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to be described in the
         Registration Statement or the Prospectus which is not so described or
         is not described as required. There are no outstanding loans, advances
         (except normal advances for business expenses in the ordinary course of
         business) or guarantees of indebtedness by the Company to or for the

         of their respective family members, except as disclosed in the
         Registration Statement and the Prospectus;

                  (u)      the Company maintains a system of internal accounting

         transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
         specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
         permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and
         to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to financial and
         corporate books and records is permitted only in accordance with
         management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded

         reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
         any differences;

                  (v)      all liens, charges, encumbrances, claims or
         restrictions on or affecting the Properties which are required to be
         disclosed in the Prospectus are disclosed therein; to the knowledge of
         the Company, (i) no lessee of any portion of any of the Properties is
         in default under any of the leases governing such properties and there
         is no event which, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice,
         or both, would constitute a default under any of such leases, except
         such defaults that would not have a material adverse effect on the
         condition (financial or other), business, prospects, net worth or
         results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a
         whole; (ii) the intended use and occupancy of each of the Properties
         complies with all applicable codes and zoning laws and regulations, if

         operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and
         (iii) there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
         threatened condemnation, zoning change, environmental or other
         proceeding or action that will in any material respect affect the size
         of, use of, improvements on, construction on, or access to the
         Properties, except such proceedings or actions that would not have a
         material adverse effect on the condition (financial or other),


                                       9

         business, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the Company
         and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                  (w)      the Company has, and will maintain, property and
         casualty insurance in favor of the Company and the Subsidiaries, as the
         case may be, with respect to each of the Properties, in an amount and
         on such terms as is reasonable and customary for businesses of the type
         proposed to be conducted by the Company and the Subsidiaries; the
         Company has not received from any insurance company written notice of
         any material defects or deficiencies affecting the insurability of any
         such Properties; and

                  (x)      any certificate signed by any officer of the Company
         and delivered to the Underwriters or to counsel for the Underwriters in
         connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a
         representation and warranty by the Company to the Underwriters as to
         the matters covered thereby on the date of such certificate.

         5.       The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters
as follows:

                  (a)      to file the Prospectus (but only if the Underwriters
         have not reasonably objected thereto by notice to the Company after
         having been furnished a copy in reasonable time prior to filing)
         pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act not later than the
         Commission's close of business on the second Business Day following the
         date of determination of the offering price of the Securities;

                  (b)      to deliver to each Underwriter and counsel for the
         Underwriters, at the expense of the Company, a copy of the signed
         Registration Statement (as originally filed) and each amendment
         thereto, in each case including exhibits and, upon request, documents
         incorporated by reference therein and, during the period mentioned in
         paragraph (e) below, as many copies of the Prospectus (including all
         amendments and supplements thereto) and documents incorporated by
         reference therein as the Underwriters may reasonably request, when
         filed with the Commission; and that each such Prospectus will, at the
         time of such delivery, be identical to any electronically transmitted
         copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to
         the extent permitted by Regulation S-T;

                  (c)      from the date hereof and during such period after the
         first date of the public offering of the Securities that, in the
         opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, a prospectus relating to the
         Securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales
         by an Underwriter or a dealer, to furnish to the Underwriters a copy of
         any proposed amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
         the Prospectus, for the Underwriters' review, and not to file any such
         proposed amendment or supplement to which the Underwriters reasonably
         object;

                  (d)      to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy
         or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the
         Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the
         Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in
         connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such
         same period, to advise the Underwriters promptly, and to confirm such
         advice in writing, (i)


                                       10
<PAGE>


         when any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have become
         effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to
         the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the
         Prospectus or for any additional information, (iii) of the issuance by
         the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
         Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any
         proceeding for that purpose, and (iv) of the receipt by the Company of
         any notification with respect to any suspension of the qualification of
         the Securities for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation
         or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and to use its best
         efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notification
         and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof;

                  (e)      if, during such period after the first date of the
         public offering of the Securities, in the opinion of counsel for the
         Underwriters, a prospectus relating to the Securities is required by
         law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or a
         dealer, any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary to
         amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is
         delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to
         amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, forthwith to
         prepare and, subject to Section 5(c), furnish, at the expense of the
         Company, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and
         addresses the Underwriters will furnish to the Company) to which
         Securities may have been sold by the Underwriters and to any other
         dealers upon request, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus
         as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus as so
         amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances
         when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so
         that the Prospectus will comply with law;

                  (f)      to endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and
         sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the
         Underwriters shall reasonably request and to continue such
         qualification in effect so long as reasonably required for distribution
         of the Securities and to pay all fees and expenses (including fees and
         disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters) reasonably incurred in
         connection with such qualification and in connection with the
         determination of the eligibility of the Securities for investment under
         the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate;
         provided that the Company shall not be required to file a general
         consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

                  (g)      to make generally available to its security holders
         and to the Underwriters as soon as practicable but not later than 18
         months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as
         defined in Rule 158(c)) an earnings statement covering a period of at
         least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the
         Company occurring after the effective date of the Registration
         Statement, which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
         Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder;

                  (h)      so long as the Securities are outstanding, to furnish
         to the Underwriters copies of all reports or other communications
         (financial or other) furnished to holders of


                                       11

         Securities, and copies of any reports and financial statements
         furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities
         exchange;

                  (i)      to use the net proceeds received by it from the sale
         of the Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use
         of Proceeds";

                  (j)      to use its best efforts to continue to meet the
         requirements to qualify as a REIT under the Code for the taxable year
         in which sales of the Securities are to occur, unless otherwise
         specified in the Prospectus;

                  (k)      during the period beginning on the date hereof and
         continuing to and including the Business Day following the Closing
         Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any
         debt securities of or guaranteed by the Company which are substantially
         similar to the Securities without the Underwriters' prior written
         consent; and

                  (l)      to pay all costs and expenses incident to the
         performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limiting

         the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the
         Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any preliminary prospectus

         thereto), (iii) incurred in connection with the registration or
         qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the

         6.       The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be
subject to the following conditions:

                  (a)      the representations and warranties of the Company
         contained herein are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date as

         prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the

<PAGE>


         information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with
         to the Underwriters' satisfaction;

                  (c)      subsequent to the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have occurred
         any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of (i) any
         intended or potential downgrading or (ii) any review or possible change
         that indicates anything other than a stable outlook, in the rating
         accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any
         "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term
         is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; and
         the Securities shall in no event be rated less than BBB- by Standard

         properties, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of
         operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the
         effect of which in the judgment of the Underwriters makes it
         impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
         delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated
         in the Prospectus;

                  (e)      the Underwriters shall have received on and as of the
         Closing Date a certificate satisfactory to the Underwriters, of the
         President or the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial

         Company as are satisfactory to the Underwriters, to the effect set
         forth in subsections (a) through (c) of this Section and to the further
         effect that there has not occurred any material adverse change, or any
         development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or
         affecting the general affairs, business, prospects, management,
         properties, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of
         operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole from
         that set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement;

                  (f)      Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, counsel for the Company,
         shall have furnished to the Underwriters its written opinion, dated the

         to the effect that:

                           (i)      the Company has been duly organized and is
                  validly existing as a real estate investment trust under the
                  laws of the State of Texas, with power and authority to own
                  its properties and conduct its business as described in the
                  Prospectus as then amended or supplemented;

                           (ii)     the Company is qualified for the transaction
                  of business and is in good standing under the laws of each
                  other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or
                  conducts any business, so as to require such qualification,
                  other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good
                  standing would not have a material adverse effect on the
                  general affairs, business prospects, management, properties,


                                       13

                  financial position, shareholders' equity or results of
                  operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
                  whole (a "Material Adverse Effect");

                           (iii)    each of the Subsidiaries has been duly
                  organized and is validly existing as corporations, limited
                  partnerships or limited liability companies, as the case may
                  be, in good standing under the laws of their jurisdictions of
                  organization, with power and authority to own their properties
                  and conduct their business as described in the Prospectus as
                  amended or supplemented; except as disclosed in the

                  securities that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
                  material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
                  the Company owns no capital stock or other beneficial interest
                  in any corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture or other
                  business entity; and except as otherwise stated in the
                  Registration Statement and the Prospectus, all of the issued
                  and outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests of
                  each Subsidiary that is a corporation or similar entity have
                  been duly authorized and are validly issued, are fully paid
                  and non-assessable and, to the best of the knowledge of such
                  counsel, are owned by the Company, directly or through
                  Subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest,
                  mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim;

                           (iv)     each of the Subsidiaries has been duly
                  qualified as foreign corporations for the transaction of
                  business and is in good standing under the laws of each other
                  jurisdiction in which they own or lease properties, or conduct
                  any business, so as to require such qualification, other than
                  where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would
                  not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its
                  Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                           (v)      other than as set forth or contemplated in
                  the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental
                  investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to
                  the best of such counsel's knowledge, threatened to which the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be a party or to
                  which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
                  is or may be the subject which, if determined adversely to the
                  Company or such Subsidiary, could individually or in the
                  aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
                  Effect; to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such
                  proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental
                  authorities or threatened by others; and such counsel does not
                  know of any contracts or other documents of a character
                  required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration
                  Statement or required to be described in the Registration
                  Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or
                  incorporated by reference from another filing with the
                  Commission or described as required;

                           (vi)     this Agreement has been duly authorized,
                  executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and
                  binding agreement of the Company on the date hereof, except as
                  rights to indemnity and contribution hereunder may be limited
                  by applicable law;

                           (vii)    the Securities have been duly authorized,
                  and when executed and authenticated in accordance with the
                  terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the
                  Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
                  will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company
                  entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture,
                  enforceable in accordance with their terms, except that the
                  enforceability thereof may be limited by or be subject to (a)
                  bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
                  moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter existing
                  which affect the rights and remedies of creditors generally
                  and (b) equitable principles of general applicability;

                           (viii)   the Indenture has been duly authorized,
                  executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
                  and binding instrument of the Company enforceable in
                  accordance with its terms, except that the enforceability
                  thereof may be limited by or be subject to (a) bankruptcy,
                  reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium
                  or other similar laws now or hereafter existing which affect
                  the rights and remedies of creditors generally and (b)
                  equitable principles of general applicability; and the
                  Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture
                  Act;

                           (ix)     to the best of such counsel's knowledge,
                  neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries are, nor with the
                  giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be, in
                  violation of or in default under, their respective
                  Declarations of Trust, Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws or
                  limited partnership or limited liability company agreement or
                  any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or
                  other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which
                  the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which
                  they or any of their respective properties are bound, except
                  for violations and defaults which individually and in the
                  aggregate are not material to the Company or to the holders of
                  the Securities; the issue and sale of the Securities and the
                  performance by the Company of its obligations under the
                  Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the
                  consummation of the transactions herein and therein
                  contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of
                  any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
                  under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement
                  or other material agreement or instrument known to such
                  counsel to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or
                  by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or to which
                  any of the property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary
                  is subject, nor will any such action result in any violation
                  of the provisions of the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws
                  of the Company or any applicable law or statute or any order,
                  rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body
                  having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties;

                           (x)      the Company has authorized and outstanding
                  shares of beneficial interest as set forth under the caption
                  "Capitalization" in the Prospectus;

                           (xi)     no consent, approval, authorization, order,
                  registration or qualification of or with any court or
                  governmental agency or body is required for


                                       15
<PAGE>


                  the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation of
                  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
                  Indenture, except such consents, approvals, authorizations,
                  registrations or qualifications as have been obtained under
                  the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and as may be
                  required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection
                  with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the
                  Underwriters;

                           (xii)    the statements in the Prospectus under the
                  captions "Description of Capital Shares," "Description of
                  Warrants," "Description of Debt Securities," and "Description
                  of the Notes," and other statements in the Prospectus and each
                  document incorporated by reference from the Company's Annual
                  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and
                  in the Registration Statement insofar as such statements
                  constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or
                  proceedings referred to therein, in each case fairly present
                  the information called for with respect to such legal matters,
                  documents or proceedings; the descriptions in the Registration
                  Statement and Prospectus of contracts and other documents
                  which are filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement are
                  accurate in all material respects and fairly present the
                  information required to be shown; and to such counsel's
                  knowledge there are no statutes or legal or governmental
                  proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus that
                  are not described as required;

                           (xiii)   the Company is not, and will not become as a
                  result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement, an "investment company" within the meaning of
                  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and has not
                  been an "investment company" at any time since 1988;

                           (xiv)    to such counsel's knowledge, (i) with the
                  exception of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of
                  April 15, 1997, between the Company, Camden Operating, L.P.,

                  dated as of January 7, 2000, there are no contracts,
                  agreements or understandings between the Company and any
                  person granting such person the right to require the Company
                  to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with
                  respect to any securities of the Company owned by such person,
                  and (ii) no person has the right to require the Company to
                  register such securities pursuant to the Registration
                  Statement;

                           (xv)     the Registration Statement has become
                  effective under the Securities Act; any required filing of the
                  Prospectus under Rule 424 under the Securities Act has been
                  made; to the best knowledge of such counsel no stop order
                  suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has
                  been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been
                  instituted or threatened by the Commission;

                           (xvi)    such counsel (A) is of the opinion that each
                  document incorporated by reference in the Registration
                  Statement and the Prospectus (except for the financial
                  statements included therein as to which such counsel need
                  express no opinion) complied as to form in all material
                  respects with the Exchange Act when filed with the Commission,
                  (B) believes that (except for the financial statements
                  included therein as to which such counsel need express no
                  belief) the Registration Statement (including the documents
                  incorporated by reference therein) filed with the Commission
                  pursuant to the Securities Act relating to the Securities, at
                  the time of filing the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended
                  December 31, 2003 with the Commission, did not contain an
                  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
                  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
                  make the statements therein not misleading, (C) is of the
                  opinion that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and
                  any amendments and supplements thereto (except for the
                  financial statement included therein as to which such counsel
                  need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material
                  respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
                  Trust Indenture Act and (D) believes that (except for the
                  financial statements included therein as to which such counsel
                  need express no belief) the Registration Statement and the
                  Prospectus, on the date of this Agreement and as of the
                  Closing Date, did not contain any untrue statement of a
                  material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
                  stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
                  misleading, and that the Prospectus as amended or
                  supplemented, if applicable, does not contain any untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
                  necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
                  light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
                  misleading.

                  In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to
         matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the
         United States and the State of Texas, to the extent such counsel deems
         proper and to the extent specified in such opinion, if at all, upon an
         opinion or opinions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
         the Underwriters' counsel) of other counsel reasonably acceptable to
         the Underwriters' counsel, familiar with the applicable laws; (B) as to
         matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deems proper, on
         certificates of responsible officers of the Company and


                                       17
<PAGE>


         certificates or other written statements of officials of jurisdictions
         having custody of documents respecting the corporate existence or good
         standing of the Company. The opinion of such counsel for the Company
         shall state that the opinion of any such other counsel is in form
         satisfactory to such counsel and, in such counsel's opinion, the
         Underwriters and they are justified in relying thereon. With respect to
         the matters to be covered in subparagraph (xvi) above counsel may state
         its opinion and belief is based upon their participation in the
         preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any
         amendment or supplement thereto (other than the documents incorporated
         by reference therein) and review and discussion of the contents thereof
         (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) but is
         without independent check or verification except as specified.

                  (g)      Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, tax counsel for the
         Company, shall have delivered to the Underwriters its written opinion,
         dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Underwriters, to the effect that:

                           (i)      the Company met the requirements for
                  qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust
                  ("REIT") for the taxable years 1993 through 2003;

                           (ii)     the Company's diversity of equity ownership
                  and proposed method of operation should allow it to qualify as
                  a REIT for its 2004 taxable year; and

                           (iii)    the discussion contained under the caption
                  "Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your
                  Investment" and "Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the
                  Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement,
                  accurately reflects existing law and fairly addresses the
                  material federal income tax issues described therein.

                  In rendering such opinions, Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP may rely
         as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates
         of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel
         states that no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which
         lead them to believe that they are not justified in relying on such
         certificates. In addition, Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP may state that
         their opinions are based upon the procedures and assumptions set forth
         in such opinion letter and that it is limited to the tax matters
         specifically covered thereby and that they have not addressed any other
         tax consequences.

                  (h)      concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement, or on the Closing Date prior to payment and delivery of the
         Securities, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the
         Underwriters a letter, dated the date of its delivery, addressed to the
         Underwriters and in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Underwriters, confirming that they are an independent registered public
         accounting firm with respect to the Company as required by the
         Securities Act and with respect to the financial statements and certain
         financial and other statistical and numerical information contained in
         the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or incorporated by
         reference therein. Such letter shall contain information of the type
         customarily included in accountants' comfort letters to underwriters.
         If such letter is delivered as of the date of this Agreement,


                                       18
<PAGE>


         then at the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to
         the Underwriters a letter, dated the date of its delivery, which shall
         confirm, on the basis of a review in accordance with the procedures set
         forth in such letter, that nothing has come to their attention during
         the period from the date of the letter referred to in the prior
         sentence to a date (specified in the letter) not more than three days
         prior to the Closing Date which would require any change in their
         letter dated the date hereof if it were required to be dated and
         delivered at the Closing Date;

                  (i)      the Underwriters shall have received on and as of the
         Closing Date an opinion of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for
         the Underwriters, with respect to the validity of the Indenture and the
         Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other
         related matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request, and such
         counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may
         reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; Sidley
         Austin Brown & Wood LLP may rely upon the opinion of Locke Liddell &
         Sapp LLP as to matters of Texas law; and

                  (j)      on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
         have furnished to the Underwriters such further certificates and
         documents confirming the representations and warranties contained
         herein and related matters as the Underwriters shall reasonably
         request.

         The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all
material respects satisfactory to the Underwriters and their counsel.

         7.       The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the
meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including without limitation the reasonable legal fees and other expenses
(including expenses of investigation and settlement) incurred in connection with
any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the
Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any
preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Company in writing by
such Underwriter expressly for use therein; provided, that the foregoing
indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling such
Underwriter) if such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission made in such preliminary prospectus is eliminated or remedied in the
Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto) and, if required by law, a copy of the
Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) shall not have been furnished to such
person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities at or prior to
the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person.


                                       19

         Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its trust managers, its officers who sign the
Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act,
to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each
Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter
furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or
any preliminary prospectus.

         If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or
regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against
any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the
two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly
notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying
Person") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the
Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person
to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees
and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding,
any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have
mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within
a reasonable time to retain counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or
(iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the
Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified
Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are
incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters and any such control
persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters and
any such separate firm for the Company, its trust managers, its officers who
sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or
authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The
Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to
indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person
to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as
contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person
agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30
days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii)
such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in
accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No
Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity
could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii)
does not include a


                                       20
<PAGE>


statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

         If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs
of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then
each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred
to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one
hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed
to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering
of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the
total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters
bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the
Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

         The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses,
claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an
Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed
to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that
such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligation to
contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their
respective underwriting commitments as set forth in Schedule I hereto and not
joint.


                                       21

         The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7
are in addition to any liability which the Indemnifying Persons may otherwise
have to the Indemnified Persons referred to above.

         The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7
and the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
(i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on
behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling
the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.

         8.       Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may
be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters, by notice given to
the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at
or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be
performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations
hereunder is not fulfilled, (iii) there shall have occurred, since the
respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus, any material adverse change or any development involving a
prospective material adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, business affairs, properties,
management or business prospects of the Company, whether or not arising in the
ordinary course of business, (iv) trading generally shall have been suspended or
materially limited on or by the New York Stock Exchange, (v) trading of any
securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any
exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (vi) a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities in New York or Texas shall have been declared by
either Federal, Texas or New York State authorities; or there shall have
occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or
clearance services in the United States, (vii) there has occurred any
downgrading or notice of any intended or potential downgrading or any review or
possible change that indicates anything other than a stable outlook in the
rating of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized
statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2)
under the Securities Act) or (viii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the
United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other
calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions
in the United States that, in the judgment of the Underwriters, is material and
adverse and which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes it impracticable
or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities
on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

         9.       If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters
shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to
purchase under this Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities
which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused
to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the
proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their
respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of
Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters,
or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the
Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed


                                       22
<PAGE>


or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the
principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase
pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in
excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written
consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or
Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate
principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more
than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased,
and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the
purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default,
this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any
non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the
Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date,
but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes,
if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other
documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph
shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any
default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

         10.      If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or
any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to
comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or
if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any condition of the Underwriters' obligations cannot be
fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters
as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for
all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their
counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this
Agreement or the offering of Securities contemplated hereunder.

         11.      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Company, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein
and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in
this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm
or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect
of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Securities
from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such
purchase.

         12.      All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by
any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be
given at c/o Banc of America Securities LLC, 40 West 57th Street, NY1-040-27-01,

         13.      Miscellaneous. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts,
each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed

the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

CUSIP No.: 133131 AN 2

         CAMDEN PROPERTY TRUST, a real estate investment trust organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Texas (hereinafter called the "Company,"
which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter
referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or
registered assigns, upon presentation, the principal sum of Two Hundred and
Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000) on January 15, 2010 at the office or agency
of the Company referred to below, and to pay interest thereon from December 20,
2004, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been
paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 in
each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing July 15, 2005 at the
rate of 4.375% per annum, until the entire principal hereof is paid or duly
provided for. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for
on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided for in the Indenture, be paid to
the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities)
is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest which shall be January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as
the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of
such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be
given to Holders of Securities of this series not more than 15 days and not less
than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in
any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such
notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the
Indenture.



<PAGE>


         Payment of the principal of, or Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest
on, the Securities will be made to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee
in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of
payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided,
however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by
(i) check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address
shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer of funds to an
account of the Person entitled thereto maintained within the United States.

         Securities of this series may be redeemed at any time at the option of
the Company, in whole or in part, upon notice of not more than 60 nor less than
30 days prior to the Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to the sum of
(i) the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed plus accrued interest
thereon to the Redemption Date and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount, if any, with
respect to such Securities.

         REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY SET
FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES

                              4.375% NOTE DUE 2010


         This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more
series under an Indenture, dated as of February 11, 2003, (herein called the
"Indenture"), between the Company and SunTrust Bank, a banking corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Georgia, as Trustee
(herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under
the Indenture with respect to the series of which this Security is a part), to
which Indenture and all board resolutions and indentures supplemental thereto
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations
of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and
are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series
designated on the first page hereof.

         "Make-Whole Amount" means, in connection with any optional redemption
or accelerated payment of any Security, the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate
present value as of the date of such redemption or accelerated payment of each
dollar of principal being redeemed or paid and the amount of interest (exclusive
of interest accrued to the date of redemption or accelerated payment) that would
have been payable in respect of such dollar if such redemption or accelerated
payment had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semi-annual basis,
such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate (determined on the third
Business Day preceding the date such notice of redemption is given or
declaration of acceleration is made) from the respective dates on which such
principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption or accelerated
payment had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities being redeemed or paid.

         "Reinvestment Rate" means 0.15% (fifteen one-hundredths of one percent)
plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the respective headings "This Week"
and "Last Week" published in the Statistical Release under the caption "Treasury
Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month)
corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the payment date of the
principal being redeemed or paid. If no maturity exactly corresponds to such
maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to
such maturity shall be calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
and the Reinvestment Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields
on a straight-line basis, rounding in each of such relevant periods to the
nearest month. For purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most
recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the
Make-Whole Amount shall be used.

         "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designated
"H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the
Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United
States government securities adjusted to constant maturities or, if such
statistical release is not published at the time of any determination under the
Indenture, then such other reasonably comparable index which shall be designated
by the Company.

         The covenants set forth in Section 10.12 of the Indenture shall be
fully applicable to this Security.

         The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the
entire indebtedness of the Company on this Security and (b) certain restrictive
covenants and the related defaults and Events of Default applicable to the
Company, in each case, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions
set forth in the Indenture, which provisions apply to this Security.

         If any Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of, and the Make-Whole Amount, if any,
on, the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner
and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

         As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a


                                       3
<PAGE>


continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this
series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to
institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee, offered
the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at
the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and the Trustee
shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of
such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to
any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any
payment of principal hereof (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or any
interest on and any Additional Amounts in respect thereof on or after the
respective due dates expressed herein.

         The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding affected thereby. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive
compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain
past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu
hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if
any, on, and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any Place of Payment where the principal of,
Make-Whole Amount, if any, on, and interest on this Security are payable, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or
more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

         The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth,
Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount
of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as
requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

         No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement
contained in the Indenture or in this Security, or because of any indebtedness
evidenced thereby, shall be had against any promoter, as such or, against any
past, present or future shareholder, officer, trust manager or director, as
such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company
or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or
by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or
otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the
acceptance of this Security by the Holder thereof and as part of the
consideration for the issue of the Securities of this series.

         All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
