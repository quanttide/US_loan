<PAGE>

declared effective by the SEC by such date, (ii) with respect to an additional

not have been declared effective by the SEC by such date, and (iii) with
respect to the remaining [300,000] Warrant Shares, on December 31, 2005, if a
Registration Statement shall not have been declared effective by the SEC by
such date, or (b) if, during the Effectiveness Period the Mandatory
Registration Statement is not or ceases to be effective (other than any
Suspension Period), with respect to a number of Warrant Shares equaling 7.5% of
the Shares held by the Holder at such time and which such Holder cannot freely
resell without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Company (i) be required pursuant to this Section 2.2 to issue more
warrants or shares beyond this Warrant and the Warrant Shares or (ii) be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the Mandatory Registration Statement
beyond the period specified in Section 2(a) of the Registration Rights
Agreement; and provided further, however, that no vesting shall occur under
Section 2.2(b) hereof from and after the first anniversary of the effectiveness
of the Mandatory Registration Statement; and provided further, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant Shares shall vest in accordance with
clauses (a) or (b) above only to the extent that, after giving effect to such
vesting, such vesting will not result in the Holder (together with its
Affiliates) owning, holding or beneficially owning more than 9.9% of the Common
Stock (the "Ownership Limit"), and at any time, and from time to time, if the
Holder (together with its Affiliates) owns, holds or beneficially owns a
percentage less than the Ownership Limit, then this Warrant shall thereafter
continue to vest, first with respect to any Warrant Shares that would have
vested in accordance with clauses (a) or (b) above but for the Ownership Limit
and second, otherwise in accordance with clauses (a) or (b) above, but in each
case, again, only to the extent that, after giving effect to such vesting, such
vesting will not result in the Holder (together with its Affiliates) owning,
holding or beneficially owning more than the Ownership Limit.

          2.3   Delivery of Stock Certificates on Exercise. As soon as
practicable after the exercise of this Warrant, and in any event within three

Holder, exercisable, in the aggregate, for the balance of the Warrant Shares.
Moreover, the Company shall, at the time of any exercise of this Warrant, upon
the request of the Holder, acknowledge in writing its continuing obligation to
afford to the Holder any rights to which the Holder shall continue to be
entitled after such exercise in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant;
provided, however, that if the Holder shall fail to make any such request, such
failure shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Company to afford to
the Holder any such rights.

          2.6   Payment of Taxes and Expenses. The Company shall pay any
recording, filing, stamp or similar tax which may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issuance of, and the preparation and delivery of

if the exercise of all or any portion of this Warrant is to be made in
connection with a registered public offering, a sale of the Company or any
other transaction or event, such exercise may, at the election of the Holder,

and the number of Warrant Shares shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time upon the happening of certain events as described in this Section 3.

          3.1   Subdivision or Combination of Stock; Stock Dividends. If at any
time or from time to time after the date hereof, the Company shall subdivide
(by way of stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock or
declare a dividend or make a distribution upon any class or series of stock of
the Company payable in Common Stock, the Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to such subdivision shall be reduced proportionately and the number of
Warrant Shares (calculated to the nearest whole share) shall be increased
proportionately, and conversely, in the event the outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall be combined (whether by stock combination, reverse stock split or
otherwise) into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to such combination shall be increased proportionately and
the number of Warrant Shares (calculated to the nearest whole share) shall be
decreased proportionately. The Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares,
as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of
any successive event or events described in this Section 3.1.

hereof shall have the right thereafter to convert each Warrant Share into the
kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon such reclassification, or other change by holders of the number of shares
of Common Stock into which such Warrant Shares would have been convertible
immediately prior to such reclassification or change, all subject to successive
adjustments thereafter from time to time pursuant to and in accordance with,
the provisions of this Section 3.

substantially all of its properties or assets or more than 50% of the voting
capital stock of the Company (whether issued and outstanding, newly issued,
from treasury, or any combination thereof) to any other person under any plan
or arrangement contemplating the consolidation or merger, sale or transfer, or
dissolution of the Company (each, a "Merger Transaction"), then, in each such
case, the Holder, upon the exercise of this Warrant as provided in Section 2.1
or the conversion of this Warrant as provided in Section 2.1 hereof at any time
or from time to time after the consummation of such consolidation, merger or
sale or the effective date of such dissolution, as the case may be, shall
receive, in lieu of the Warrant Shares issuable on such exercise immediately
prior to such consummation or such effective date, as the case may be, the

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

stock and property (including cash) to which the Holder would have been
entitled upon the consummation of such consolidation or merger, or sale or
transfer, or in connection with such dissolution, as the case may be, if the
Holder had so exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto (assuming the
payment by the Holder of the Exercise Price therefor as required hereby in a
form permitted hereby, which payment shall be included in the assets of the
Company for the purposes of determining the amount available for distribution),
all subject to successive adjustments thereafter from time to time pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the provisions of this Section 3. The Company shall not
effect any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless, prior to the
consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the Company)
resulting from the consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets
assumes by written instrument the obligation to deliver to each holder of
Warrants such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to acquire; provided, that
any assumption shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.

          3.4   Continuation of Terms. Upon any consolidation, merger or
transfer (and any dissolution following any such transfer) referred to in this
Section 3, this Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the terms
hereof shall be applicable to the shares of Common Stock and other securities
and property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after the
consummation of such consolidation or merger or the effective date of
dissolution following any such transfer, as the case may be, and shall be
binding upon the issuer of any such Common Stock or other securities,
including, in the case of any such transfer, the Person acquiring all or
substantially all of the properties or assets or more than 50% of the voting
capital stock of the Company (whether issued and outstanding, newly issued or
from treasury or any combination thereof), whether or not such Person shall
have expressly assumed the terms of this Warrant.

          3.5   Minimum Adjustment of Exercise Price. If the amount of any
adjustment of the Exercise Price required pursuant to this Section 3 would be
less than one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the Exercise Price in effect
at the time such adjustment is otherwise so required to be made, such amount
shall be carried forward and adjustment with respect thereto made at the time
of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount
and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate at least
one tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of such Exercise Price.

          3.6   Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment or readjustment of the Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares
pursuant to this Section 3, this Warrant shall, without any action on the part
of the Holder, be adjusted in accordance with this Section 3, and the Company,
at its expense, promptly shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

thereof), the Company shall mail to the Holder at least ten (10) business days,

applicable transfer taxes). Each of such new warrants shall be exercisable for
such number of Warrant Shares as the Holder shall direct, provided that all of
such new warrants shall represent, in the aggregate, the right to purchase the
same number of Warrant Shares and cash, securities or other property, if any,
which may be purchased by the Holder upon exercise of this Warrant at the time

merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities, sale or other transfer of
any of its assets or properties, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek
to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms
and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in
order to protect the rights of the Holder hereunder against impairment. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (a) will not increase the
par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of this
Warrant above the amount payable therefor on such exercise, and (b) will take

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

all action that may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may
validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of this Warrant.

          10.3  No Rights as Stockholder. The Holder shall not be entitled to
vote or to receive dividends (except as expressly provided herein) or to be
deemed the holder of Common Stock that may at any time be issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall anything
contained herein be construed to confer upon the Holder any of the rights of a
stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors
or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give
or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether upon any recapitalization,
issuance or reclassification of stock, change of par value or change of stock
to no par value, consolidation, merger or conveyance or otherwise), or to
receive notice of meetings (except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Warrant), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, until the Holder
shall have exercised this Warrant and been issued Warrant Shares in accordance
with the provisions hereof and continues to hold Warrant Shares.

          10.4  Notices. Any notices, reports or other correspondence
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "correspondence") required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be sent by postage prepaid first class
mail (sent certified or registered), overnight courier or facsimile
transmission, or delivered by hand to the party to whom such correspondence is
required or permitted to be given hereunder. The date of giving any notice
shall be the date of its actual receipt.

                (b)  All correspondence to the Holder shall be addressed to the
Holder at its address appearing in the books maintained by the Company.

     11.  Amendment and Waiver. No failure or delay of the Holder in exercising
any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the Holder are cumulative and not exclusive of any

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

rights or remedies which it would otherwise have. This Warrant is one of a
series of Warrants issued by the Company, all dated the date hereof and of like
tenor, except as to the number of shares of Common Stock subject thereto
(collectively, the "Company Warrants"). Any term of this Warrant may be amended
or waived upon the written consent of the Company and the holders of Company
Warrants representing at least a majority of the number of shares of Common
Stock then subject to outstanding Company Warrants; provided that (i) any such
amendment or waiver must apply to all Company Warrants then outstanding; (ii)
the number of Warrant Shares subject to this Warrant, the Exercise Price or
Expiration Date of this Warrant and the number of shares or class of stock
obtainable upon exercise of this Warrant may not be amended, (iii) the right to
exercise this Warrant may not be waived, without the written consent of the
Holder of this Warrant (it being agreed that an amendment to or waiver under
any of the provisions of Section 3 of this Warrant shall not be considered an
amendment of the number of Warrant Shares or the Exercise Price) and (iv) any
amendment that adversely affects any particular Holder without a corresponding
affect upon all Holders must be approved by the particular Holder so affected.
The Company shall promptly give notice to all holders of the Company Warrants
of any amendments effected in accordance with this Section 11. No special
consideration may be given to any holder as inducement to waive or amend this
Warrant unless such consideration is given equally and ratably to all holders
of Company Warrants.

     12.  Governing Law. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
principles of conflicts or choice of law that would result in the application
of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

     13.  Covenants To Bind Successor and Assigns. All covenants, stipulations,
promises and agreements in this Warrant contained by or on behalf of the
Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

     14.  Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Warrant shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall
endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as reasonably possible to that of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions.

     15.  Construction. The definitions of this Warrant shall apply equally to
both the singular and the plural forms of the terms defined. Wherever the
context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neuter forms. The section and paragraph headings used herein are
for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Warrant and are not to
affect the construction of or be taken into consideration in interpreting this
Warrant.

     16.  Remedies. The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all
rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to
specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that
monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by
reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to
waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate. In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision
of this Warrant or where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense,
the successful party to such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other available remedy.

     17.  Entire Agreement. This Warrant, the Securities Purchase Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties hereto and thereto respecting the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements, negotiations, understandings, representations

                                     -10-

and statements respecting the subject matter hereof and thereof, whether
written or oral, including but not limited to the various Term Sheets dated
December 2004 between the Company and the Purchasers.
