          3.2  Corporate Power and Authority. All corporate action on the part

requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and to carry out and perform its obligations under the
terms hereof and thereof.

any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any of its

Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. As of the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its Significant
Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement or waiver or been requested to enter

Schedules, each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries has withheld

          3.15  Significant Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, the Company
has no directly held Significant Subsidiary other than those disclosed in
Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedules or the SEC Reports. Each of the
Company and the Significant Subsidiaries has good title to all of the shares
(or other equity interests) it purports to own of the stock of each Significant
Subsidiary, free and clear in each case of any Lien (defined for purposes
hereof without regard to the exceptions contained in (a) to (c) of the
definition of Lien). All such shares have been duly authorized, validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable. As of the Closing Date, the Company is
not party to any joint venture or similar arrangement, except as disclosed in
the SEC Reports.

          3.16  Properties. Except as disclosed in Section 3.16 of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns its
properties and assets, including all such properties reflected in their balance
sheets included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2004, free and clear of all Liens, other than as referred

SEC Reports or Section 3.16 of the Disclosure Schedules, with respect to leased
property and assets, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
such leases and hold a valid leasehold interest, free of any Liens, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.17  Labor Relations. The Company and its Significant Subsidiaries
are not engaged in any unfair labor practice. No unfair labor practice
complaint is pending against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, before the National Labor Relations Board or similar
foreign labor relations authority, and no grievance or arbitration proceeding
arising out of or under any collective bargaining agreement is so pending
against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or, to the best of
its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. No
strike, labor dispute, slowdown or stoppage is pending against the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries or, to the best of its knowledge,
threatened against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. No union
representation question exists with respect to the employees of the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries and no union organizing activities are
taking place. The Company and its Significant Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all applicable state and federal equal opportunity and

                                      -9-

other laws related to employment. To the Company's knowledge, no employee of
the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is or will be in violation of any
judgment, decree, or order, or any term of any employment contract, patent
disclosure agreement, or other contract or agreement relating to the
relationship of any such employee with the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary, or any other party because of the nature of the business presently
conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by the Company and its
Significant Subsidiaries. The Company is not aware that any officer or key
employee, or that any group of key employees, intends to terminate their
employment with the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, nor does the Company
or any Significant Subsidiary have a present intention to terminate the
employment of any of the foregoing. Subject to general principles related to
wrongful termination of employees, the employment of each officer and employee
of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is terminable at the will of
the Company or the applicable Significant Subsidiary, except as disclosed in
the SEC Reports.

          3.18  Regulatory Matters.
                ------------------

                (a)  Authorizations. The Company holds all Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC"), state public utility commission ("PUC") and
foreign regulatory authority permits, licenses, certificates, registrations and
other similar authorizations necessary or appropriate for the conduct of its
business (collectively, the "Authorizations"), the lack of which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have maintained and kept in
force and effect, and have applied in a timely manner for renewal of all such
Authorizations. Except as disclosed in Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all such
Authorizations and any terms and conditions thereto except such non-compliance
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Section 3.18(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules, each Authorization which is material to the business of
the Company is valid and in full force and effect, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not received notice from the FCC, any PUC, or any foreign
regulatory authority of its intention to revoke, suspend, condition or fail to
renew any such Authorization, which would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed
in Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, no event has occurred or facts
and circumstances exist, which allows or would reasonably be expected to allow,
or which after notice or lapse of time would allow or would reasonably be
expected to allow, revocation, suspension, non-renewal or termination or result
in any other material impairment of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' rights
under any of its Authorizations to the extent that such revocation, termination
or impairment would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)  Compliance with Law. Except as disclosed in Section 3.18(b)
of the Disclosure Schedules, the conduct of the Company's business complies
with all applicable U.S., state, local and foreign laws (including, without
limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act), ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders
(including, without limitation, those issued by the FCC, any PUC or any foreign
regulatory authority), except where the failure to so comply would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.19  Permits. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all franchises,
permits, licenses and any similar authority (the "Permits") necessary for the
conduct of their business as now being conducted by them, the lack of which
could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation
of any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened which could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company believes it can obtain,
without undue burden or expense, any similar authority for the conduct of its
business as presently proposed to be conducted. The Company and its Significant

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries are not in default under any of such franchises, permits, licenses
or other similar authorities.

          3.20  ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Significant Subsidiary or
ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to any Plan other than those disclosed
in Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedules.

                (a)  Compliance with ERISA. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate
is in compliance with ERISA and no contributions required to be made by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any pension plan are overdue.

                (b)  PBGC. No liability to the PBGC has been or is expected to
be incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any pension
plan that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. No circumstance exists that constitutes grounds
under section 4042 of ERISA entitling the PBGC to institute proceedings to
terminate, or appoint a trustee to administer, any pension plan or trust
created thereunder, nor has the PBGC instituted any such proceeding.

                (c)  Multiemployer Plans. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or presently expects to incur any withdrawal liability
under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any multiemployer plan. There have been
no "reportable events" (as such term is defined in section 4043 of ERISA) with
respect to any multiemployer plan that could result in the termination of such
multiemployer plan and give rise to a liability of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate in respect thereof. Neither the Company nor any Significant
Subsidiary has incurred or does it expect to incur liability under Sections 412
or 4971 of the Code; and each "pension plan" for which the Company would have
any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified and
nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

          3.21  Insurance. The Company maintains insurance of the types and in
the amounts and covering such risks as is prudent and adequate for its business
as currently conducted and for the value of its properties as is customary for
companies engaged in similar lines of business in similar industries all of
which insurance is in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any
Significant Subsidiary has (i) received notice from any insurer or agent of
such insurer that capital improvements or other expenditures are required or
necessary to be made in order to continue such insurance or (ii) any reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as
and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage at reasonable cost
from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business.

          3.22  Accounts Receivable. The accounts and notes receivable of the
Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the balance sheet included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and
all accounts and notes receivable arising subsequent to December 31, 2003, in
each case subject to an allowance for doubtful accounts in accordance with
GAAP, (i) arose from bona fide sales transactions in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and are payable on ordinary trade terms,
(ii) to the knowledge of the Company and each Significant Subsidiary, are
legal, valid and binding obligations of the respective debtors enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, (iii) to the knowledge of the Company
and each Significant Subsidiary, are not subject to any valid set-off or
counterclaim, and (iv) are not the subject of any actions or proceedings
brought by or on behalf of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary.

          3.23  Brokers. Except for Tejas Securities Group Inc. ("Placement
Agent"), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability to pay any
fees, commissions or other similar compensation to any broker, finder,

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

investment banker, financial advisor or other similar Person in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          3.24  Leases. Each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries has
complied with all material obligations under all leases for real property to
which it is a party as a lessee. All leases relating to the leasehold estates
of each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries necessary for the
conduct of the business of such Person are, with respect to the Company, valid
and enforceable, and, to the knowledge of the Company, are, valid and
enforceable with respect to the lessor, and each of the Company and the
Significant Subsidiaries that is the lessee in respect thereof currently enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession of the premises subject thereto.

          3.25  Intellectual Property. Except as disclosed in Section 3.25 of
the Disclosure Schedules, each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries
owns, possesses or has the right to use all of the patents, trademarks, service
marks, trade names, copyrights, franchises and licenses, and rights with
respect thereto (collectively, "Intellectual Property"), necessary for the
present conduct of its business and as such business is proposed to be
conducted, without any infringement of the rights of others. There are no
outstanding options, licenses, or agreements of any kind relating to the
Company's and/or its Significant Subsidiaries' Intellectual Property with the
exception of agreements for the sale or license of the Company's products or
services in the ordinary course of business. The Company has not received any
communications alleging that the Company or any Significant Subsidiary has
violated or, by conducting its business as presently proposed, would violate
any of the Intellectual Property of any other Person.

          3.26  Environmental Compliance.
                ------------------------

                (a)  Compliance. The Company and each of the Significant
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Environmental Protection Laws in effect
in each jurisdiction where it is currently doing business and no material
expenditures will be required in order to comply with any Environmental
Protection Law.

                (b)  Liability. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
subject to any liability under any Environmental Protection Law that, in the
aggregate for all such liabilities, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                (c)  Notices. Neither the Company nor any Significant Subsidiary
has received any

                     (i)    notice from any Governmental Authority by which any
of its currently or previously owned or leased properties has been identified
in any manner by any Governmental Authority as a hazardous substance disposal
or removal site, "Super Fund" clean-up site, or candidate for removal or
closure pursuant to any Environmental Protection Law,

                     (ii)   notice of any Lien arising under or in connection
with any Environmental Protection Law that has attached to any revenues of, or
to, any of its currently or previously owned or leased properties, or

                     (iii)  communication, written or oral, from any
Governmental Authority concerning any action or omission in connection with its
currently or previously owned or leased properties resulting in the release of
any hazardous substance resulting in any violation of any Environmental
Protection Law,

                                     -12-
<PAGE>

in each case where the effect of which, in the aggregate for all such notices
and communications, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          3.27  Registration Rights. Except as disclosed in Section 3.27 of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Company is not currently subject to any agreement
providing any Person any rights (including piggyback registration rights) to
have any securities of the Company registered with the SEC or registered or
qualified with any other Governmental Authority. Except as disclosed in Section
3.27 of the Disclosure Schedules, currently, no Person has, with respect to the
Company, and the Company will not grant to any Person any registration rights
(including demand and "piggyback" registration rights) inconsistent with or
superior to any of those contained in the Registration Rights Agreement, so
long as any of the registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement
remain in effect.

          3.28  Transactions with Affiliates and Employees. Except as disclosed
in the SEC Reports or Section 3.28 of the Disclosure Schedules, none of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company (or members of any such
Person's immediate family) is presently a party to any transaction or agreement
with the Company (other than for services as employees, officers and directors
entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices)
exceeding $60,000 in value, including any contract, agreement or other
arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for
rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments
to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a
substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner. Except in
connection with the Transaction Documents or as disclosed in the SEC Reports or
Section 3.28 of the Disclosure Schedules, there are no agreements,
understandings or proposed transactions between the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any of its officers, affiliates or directors,
or any of their affiliates, on the other hand.

          3.29  Internal Accounting Controls. The Company maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management's general or specific authorizations, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
l5d-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, and such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for
which they were established; the Company's auditors and the audit committee of
the Board have been advised of: (i) any significant deficiencies in the design
or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's or
its Subsidiaries' ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
data; and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a role in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' internal
controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for
the Company's auditors; since the date of the most recent evaluation of such
disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses; the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and the statements
contained in any such certification are complete and correct; and the Company

                                     -13-
<PAGE>

and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are effective.

          3.30  Securities Laws. Assuming the accuracy of the Purchasers'
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4 and 4A below, the
Investor Questionnaire executed and delivered by each Purchaser to the Company,
such Investor Questionnaire in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, and the
representations and warranties of Placement Agent set forth in the Placement
Agent's Letter, the offer, sale and issuance of the Shares and the Warrants,
and issuance of Warrant Shares, as provided in this Agreement and the Warrants,
is and is intended to be (a) exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D promulgated
thereunder, and (b) exempt from registration or qualification requirements of
applicable state securities laws (together, the "Securities Laws Exemptions").
Assuming the accuracy of representations and warranties of Placement Agent set
forth in the Placement Agent's Letter and the engagement letter executed by the
Company and Placement Agent on December 13, 2004, neither the Company nor
anyone acting on its behalf has taken any action that would cause the loss of
such exemptions.

          3.31  No Integrated Offering. Assuming the accuracy of representations
and warranties of Placement Agent set forth in the Placement Agent's Letter and
the engagement letter executed by the Company and Placement Agent on December
13, 2004, neither the Company, nor any Affiliate of the Company, nor any Person
acting on its or their behalf has, directly or indirectly, engaged in any form
of general solicitation or general advertising with respect to any security or
made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any
security, under circumstances that would cause the offering or issuance of the
Shares, the Warrants or any Warrant Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to be integrated with prior offerings by the Company for
purposes of the Securities Act which would cause the Securities Laws Exemptions
to be unavailable, or would cause any applicable state securities laws
exemptions or any applicable stockholder approval provisions exemptions,
including, without limitation, under the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which any of the
securities of the Company are listed or designated to be unavailable, nor will
the Company take any action or steps that would cause the offering or issuance
of the Shares, the Warrants or any Warrant Shares pursuant to this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to be integrated with other offerings.

          3.32  Section 203 of the DGCL. To the knowledge of the Company, no
Purchaser is an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 of Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL")) of the Company as of the Closing Date,
nor will a Purchaser be deemed an "interested stockholder" as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, and the restrictions on
"business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in
Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply to the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Board has approved the issuance to each Purchaser of the Shares, the
Warrants and the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and the
restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
will not apply to any exercise of the Warrants by a Purchaser.

          3.33  Solvency. Based on the consolidated financial condition of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, (i) the fair saleable value
of the Company's assets exceeds the amount that will be required to be paid on
or in respect of the Company's existing debts and other liabilities (including
known and contingent liabilities) as they mature; (ii) the Company's assets do
not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its business for the
current fiscal year as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, including
its capital needs taking into account the particular capital requirements of
the business conducted by the Company, projected capital requirements and
capital availability thereof; and (iii) the current cash flow of the Company,
together with the proceeds the Company would receive were it to liquidate all
of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash,

                                     -14-
<PAGE>

would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debts when such
amounts are required to be paid. The Company has no present intention to incur
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account
the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt).

          3.34  S-3 Eligibility. The Company is currently eligible under the
eligibility requirements of General Instruction I.B.3 to Registration Statement
on Form S-3 to register the resale of its Common Stock on a registration
statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act. To the knowledge of the
Company, there exist no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to prohibit or delay the preparation and filing of a registration
statement on Form S-3 with respect to the Shares and the Warrant Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement.

     4    Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers. In order to induce
the Company to enter into this Agreement and to sell the Shares and the
Warrants, each Purchaser hereby makes the following representations and
warranties severally (as to such Purchaser only) and not jointly, as of the
Closing Date, all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the purchase of the Shares for a period of 24 months, as provided
in Section 8.9:

          4.1   Authorization. All corporate, partnership or limited liability
company action on the part of such Purchaser necessary for the authorization,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Registration
Rights Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
and therein, has been taken. When executed and delivered by such Purchaser,
each of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement shall constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser, enforceable against
such Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as such may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles. Such Purchaser has all
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and
authority to enter into each of this Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement and to carry out and perform its obligations under the terms hereof
and thereof.

          4.2   Purchase Entirely for Own Account. Such Purchaser is acquiring
the Shares and the Warrants for its own account for investment and not for the
account of any other person or with a view to any resale, fractionalization,
division, or distribution thereof in a manner that would require registration
thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities Act. Such
Purchaser has no contract, undertaking, agreement, understanding or arrangement
with any person to sell, transfer, or pledge to any person any part or all of
the Shares and the Warrants which such Purchaser is acquiring, or any interest
therein, and have no present plans to enter into the same. The Shares, the
Warrants and the Warrant Shares were offered or sold to such Purchaser by means
of a direct solicitation by the Company and Placement Agent.

          4.3   Investor Status; Etc. Such Purchaser certifies and represents to
the Company that (i) it is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act
and was not organized for the purpose of acquiring any of the Shares or the
Warrants or is an individual with net worth in excess of $100 million and (ii)
such Purchaser's Investor Questionnaire is complete and correct. Such Purchaser
has adequate means of providing for his, her or its current needs and personal
contingencies, has no need now, and anticipates no need in the foreseeable
future, to sell the Shares and the Warrants, and currently has sufficient net
worth and financial liquidity to afford a complete loss of his, her or its
investment in the Company. Such Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so that such Purchaser is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Company (including, without
limitation, the risks described in the Information Package) and has made such
evaluation. Such Purchaser fully understands that the Shares, the Warrants and
the Warrant Shares are speculative investments which involve a high degree of
risk of loss of such Purchaser's entire investment. No person or entity, other

                                     -15-
<PAGE>

than the Company, Placement Agent or their authorized representatives, has
offered the Shares or the Warrants to such Purchaser. Such Purchaser is able to
bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares and the Warrants.

          4.4   Securities Not Registered. Such Purchaser understands that the
Shares, the Warrants and any Warrant Shares issued thereunder have not been
registered under the Securities Act, by reason of their issuance by the Company
in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act, and that the Shares, the Warrants and any Warrant Shares issued thereunder
must continue to be held by such Purchaser unless a subsequent disposition
thereof is registered under the Securities Act or is exempt from such
registration. Such Purchaser understands that the exemptions from registration
afforded by Rule 144 (the provisions of which are known to it) promulgated
under the Securities Act depend on the satisfaction of various conditions, and
that, if applicable, Rule 144 may afford the basis for sales only in limited
amounts. Such Purchaser has had an opportunity to ask questions of and receive
answers from the management and authorized representatives of the Company, and
to review any other relevant documents and records concerning the business of
the Company and the terms and conditions of this investment, and that any such
questions have been answered to such Purchaser's full satisfaction. Such
Purchaser understands that no federal or state agency has passed upon or made
any recommendation or endorsement of an investment in the Shares or the
Warrants.

          4.5   No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and performance by
such Purchaser of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement nor
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof by such Purchaser
(a) will contravene any applicable provision of any law, statute, rule,
regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or Governmental
Authority, except as would not have a material adverse effect on such
Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; or (b)
will violate any provision of the organizational documents of such Purchaser,
except as would not have a material adverse effect on such Purchaser's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

          4.6   Brokers. Such Purchaser has no liability to pay any fees,
commissions or other similar compensation to any broker, finder, investment
banker, financial advisor or other similar Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          4.7   Consents. All consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
required on the part of such Purchaser in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein have been obtained and are effective as of the
date hereof.

     4A   Additional Representations, Warranties and Acknowledgement of the
Purchasers. In order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement and
to sell the Shares and the Warrants, each Purchaser hereby makes the following
representations and warranties severally (as to such Purchaser only) and not
jointly, as of the Closing Date, all of which shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the purchase of the Shares for a period of 24
months, as provided in Section 8.9:

          (a)   Such Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Company recently
announced its agreement to acquire a 50% interest in HNS, which is a newly
formed limited liability company that will acquire substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of Hughes Network Systems, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of The DirecTV Group, Inc. Further, such Purchaser acknowledges that
the Company possesses material, non-public information regarding HNS (the
"Information"). At such Purchaser's request, such Purchaser has not been
provided with any of the Information and such Purchaser acknowledges that the
Information might be material to its decision to enter into this Agreement or
otherwise materially adverse to its interests. Such Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that it does not wish to receive any of the Information, notwithstanding
the Company's offer to disclose and discuss the same with such Purchaser.

                                     -16-
<PAGE>

          (b)   Such Purchaser further represents that, notwithstanding not
receiving the Information, it believes it has adequate information concerning
the business and financial condition of the Company to make an informed
decision regarding entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Such Purchaser has independently and without reliance upon the
Information or otherwise upon the Company (except to the extent expressly set
forth in this Agreement), Placement Agent or their agents, made its own
analysis and decision to enter into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, (x) the Company shall not be deemed
to have made any representation or warranty (including in respect of the
Company's information package dated December 15, 2004 (the "Information
Package")) other than as expressly made by the Company in this Agreement and
(y) neither the Company nor Placement Agent shall be deemed to have made any
representation or warranty regarding the Information. Such Purchaser
understands the disadvantage to which it may be subject on account of its
express desire not to receive the Information.

          (c)   Such Purchaser is relying solely upon the advice of its own
financial, legal and tax advisors and its entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is the result of independent arm's length
negotiations between such Purchaser and the Company. Such Purchaser also
acknowledges that the Company and Placement Agent are relying on Sections 4 and
4A and would not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
the absence of Sections 4 and 4A.

          (d)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, such Purchaser hereby irrevocably and forever releases and discharges
the Company, Placement Agent and their respective affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, representatives, agents, advisors and controlling persons
and their respective successors and assigns from any and all Losses, including,
but not limited to, any and all liabilities, claims or demands (legal,
equitable or otherwise) alleging violations of federal or state securities
laws, common law fraud or deceit, breach or fiduciary duty, negligence, tort or
any other theory, based upon, arising from, relating to, or in connection with,
directly or indirectly, the non-disclosure of, in whole or in part, the
Information.

          (e)   Such Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it is familiar with its
responsibilities under federal and state securities laws relating to
restrictions on trading in securities of an issuer while in possession of
material, non-public information, and restrictions on sharing such information
with other persons who may engage in such trading. Such Purchaser represents
and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company that neither it nor any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives has violated, and
none of them will violate, any of such restrictions with respect to the Shares,
Warrants, Warrant Shares or any other securities of the Company.

     6    Certain Covenants and Agreements.

          6.1   Transfer of Securities. Each Purchaser agrees severally (as to
itself only) and not jointly that it shall not sell, assign, pledge, transfer
or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares, the Warrants or any
Warrant Shares, except: (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act; (ii) to an Affiliate of such Purchaser (so long as

                                     -19-
<PAGE>

such Affiliate is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2),
(3) or (7) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and was not
organized for the purpose of acquiring any of the Shares or the Warrants or is
an individual with net worth in excess of $100 million, and agrees in a written
instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company to be
bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement to the fullest extent as such Purchaser) or, for no consideration, to
a limited number of partners or members in a pro rata distribution in
accordance with such Purchaser's existing governance documents (so long as such
distribution is not presently contemplated and such partner or member agrees in
a written instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement to the fullest extent as such Purchaser); or
(iii) pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities
Act (including sales permitted pursuant to Rule 144) and applicable state
securities laws, so long as the transferee (other than in sales permitted
pursuant to Rule 144) agrees in a written instrument in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to be bound by the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement to the fullest extent
as such Purchaser). If the Company requests an opinion of counsel for such
transferor that the proposed transfer may be effected without registration of
such Shares, the Warrants or any Warrant Shares under the Securities Act
(including sales permitted pursuant to Rule 144), such transferor shall not be
entitled to effect such transfer unless and until the Company receives such an
opinion of counsel (which counsel and opinion shall each be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company). Any transfer or purported transfer of the Shares
in violation of this Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 shall be void. The Company
shall not register any transfer of the Shares in violation of this Section 6.1
or Section 6.2. The Company may, and may instruct any transfer agent for the
Company, to place such stop transfer orders as may be required on the transfer
books of the Company in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of this
Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.

          6.2   Legends.
                -------

                (a)  Each certificate or other document evidencing the Shares,
the Warrants and any Warrant Shares shall be endorsed with the legend
substantially as set forth below, and each Purchaser covenants that, except to
the extent such restrictions are waived by the Company, it shall not transfer
the shares represented by any such certificate without complying with the
restrictions on transfer described in this Agreement and the legends endorsed
on such certificate:

     "THE SHARES [WARRANT, WARRANT SHARES] REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE
NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT
BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
SAID ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT
SUBJECT TO, REGISTRATION UNDER SAID ACT. IN ADDITION, THE TRANSFER HEREOF IS
SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
DATED DECEMBER 23, 2004. A COPY OF SUCH CONDITIONS WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE
HOLDER UPON REQUEST."

                (b)  The legend set forth in Section 6.2(a) shall be removed
from the certificates evidencing the Shares, Warrants and any Warrant Shares,
(i) following any sale of such Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares pursuant to
Rule 144 or any effective registration statement, or (ii) if such Shares,
Warrants or Warrant Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144(k) (and the
holder of such Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares has submitted a written
request for removal of the legend, along with a legal opinion, if reasonably
requested by the Company, to the effect that the holder has complied with the
applicable provisions of Rule 144), or (iii) if such legend is not required
under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial
interpretations and pronouncements issued by the Staff of the SEC) (and the

                                     -20-
<PAGE>

holder of such Shares, Warrants, or Warrant Shares has submitted a written
request for removal of the legend, along with a legal opinion, if reasonably
requested by the Company, to the effect that the holder has complied with such
judicial interpretation or pronouncement). Subject to receipt of appropriate
certifications and opinions, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
promptly upon the occurrence of any of the events in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
above to effect the removal of the legend on certificates evidencing the Shares
or any Warrant Shares and shall also cause its counsel (including its general
counsel) to issue a "blanket" legal opinion to the Company's transfer agent
promptly after the effective date of any registration statement covering the
resale of the Shares or any Warrant Shares (provided that there is an effective
registration statement covering the resale of the Shares or any Warrant Shares,
as the case may be), if required by the Company's transfer agent, to allow
sales without restriction pursuant to an effective registration statement. The
Company agrees that at such time as such legend is no longer required under
this Section 6.2(b), it will, no later than three (3) business days following
the delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or the Company's transfer agent of a
certificate representing the Shares, Warrants or any Warrant Shares issued with
a restrictive legend, deliver or cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a
certificate representing such Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares that is free
from all restrictive and other legends; provided that in the case of removal of
the legend for reasons set forth in clause (ii) above, the holder of such
Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares has submitted a written request for removal
of the legend indicating that the holder has complied with the applicable
provisions of Rule 144. The Company may not make any notation on its records or
give instructions to any transfer agent of the Company that enlarge the
restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 6.

          6.3   Publicity. Except to the extent required by applicable laws,
rules, regulations or stock exchange requirements, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, disclose or publish the
name of such Purchaser in any press release or public announcement. Except to
the extent required by applicable laws, rules, regulations or stock exchange
requirements, the Purchasers and their Affiliates shall not, without the
written consent of the Company make any public announcement or issue any press
release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties agree that the Company shall issue a press release in the form of
Exhibit I hereto promptly following (and in no event more than one business day
after) the Closing and, on or before 9:30 a.m., New York time, on the first
trading day following the Closing Date, the Company shall file a Current Report
on Form 8-K describing the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents in the form required by the Exchange
Act, and attaching the material transaction documents (including, without
limitation, this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement) as exhibits
to such filing (including all attachments, the "8-K Filing"). The Company
represents and warrants that, as of the filing of the 8-K Filing with the SEC,
no Purchaser will be in possession of any material, nonpublic information
received from the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors or employees, that is not disclosed in the 8-K Filing.
Notwithstanding the Company's offer to disclose and discuss material non-public
information with each Purchaser upon such Purchaser's entering into a mutually
satisfactory confidentiality agreement, at each Purchaser's request, the
Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and each of
their respective officers, directors or employees not to, provide any Purchaser
with any material nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from and after the filing of the 8-K Filing with the SEC without
the express written consent of such Purchaser; except that (x) the Company
shall not be responsible for any information obtained by any Purchaser or any
Investor (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) as a result of such
Purchaser's exercise of its inspection rights under the Registration Rights
Agreement, or (y) the Company shall be permitted to give any Purchaser notice
of a Suspension Period (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and
the other related certifications in accordance with the Registration Rights
Agreement without such prior written consent.

          6.4   Use of Proceeds. The Company covenants and agrees, and the
Purchaser acknowledges, that the proceeds from the sale of the Shares and
Warrants shall be used by the Company for any lawful corporate purpose.

          6.5   Integration. The Company shall not sell, offer for sale or
solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as
defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the
offer or sale of the Shares or Warrants in a manner that would require the
registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Shares or the issuance
of the Warrants or any Warrant Shares to the Purchasers.

          6.6   Listing of Shares. The Company agrees that at any time, if and
when its shares of Common Stock are listed on NASDAQ or any other securities
exchange, that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly list and
qualify the Shares and any Warrant Shares for trading on NASDAQ or such other
securities exchange.

          6.7   Actions with respect to Securities Laws Exemptions. Neither the
Company nor anyone acting on its behalf shall take any action that would cause
the loss of any Securities Laws Exemptions.

          6.8   Restrictions on Certain Stock Issuances or Registrations. The
Company agrees that prior to the effectiveness of the Mandatory Registration
Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the Company shall
not (i) issue any shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into or
exercisable for shares of Common Stock or agree to do so, in an offering
registered under the Securities Act prior to the effectiveness of the Mandatory
Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), or
(ii) grant any registration rights after the date hereof to any other Person
that would entitle such Person to have the sale of securities held by such
Person registered under the Securities Act by the Company under a registration
statement that is declared effective prior to the effectiveness of the
Mandatory Registration Statement, provided, that this Section 6.8 shall not be
deemed to restrict the ability of the Company to (a) issue shares of Common
Stock upon the exercise or conversion of any options, warrants, convertible
debt instruments or other contingent securities outstanding on the date hereof,
(b) issue shares, options or warrants in connection with the agreement to
acquire a 50% interest in HNS or to employees, directors or consultants of the
Company or (c) perform its obligations in connection with the agreement to
acquire a 50% interest in HNS.

whereupon such assignee or transferee shall be deemed to be a "Purchaser" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

          8.9   Survival. The respective representations and warranties given by
the parties hereto shall survive the Closing Date and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and shall expire twenty-four (24) months after
the Closing Date. Accordingly, no claim relating to any representation or
warranty given by the parties hereto may be made following such expiration. If
a claim relating to any representation or warranty given by the parties hereto
is made to the indemnifying party on or prior to the expiration thereof, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.9, such
representation or warranty shall not so expire, but rather shall remain in full
force and effect until such time as such claim which is has been fully and
finally resolved, either by means of a written settlement agreement executed on
behalf of the parties or by means of a final, non-appealable judgment issued by
a court of competent jurisdiction. The respective covenants and agreements
agreed to by a party hereto shall survive the Closing Date and the consummation

                                     -23-

of the transactions contemplated herein in accordance with their respective
terms and conditions.

          8.10  Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto respecting the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, negotiations,
understandings, representations and statements respecting the subject matter
hereof, whether written or oral, including but not limited to the various Term
Sheets dated December 2004 between the Company and the Purchasers. The Company
agrees that in the event it enters into any agreement or understanding with any
Purchaser pursuant to which the Company grants such Purchaser any rights or
other terms relating to the purchase, registration, holding or disposition of
Shares, Warrant Shares or Warrants that are more favorable than those set forth
herein or in the Transaction Documents, the Company shall also grant each other
Purchaser such more favorable rights or other terms.

          8.11  Amendments. Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to
any provision of this Agreement and any waiver of any provisions of this
Agreement shall be effective only if made or given in writing and signed by the
Company and the Majority Purchasers, provided, that any amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver that is materially and disproportionately adverse to any
Purchaser(s), when compared to all other Purchasers similarly situated, shall
require the consent of such Purchaser(s).

          8.12  No Third Party Rights. This Agreement is intended solely for the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and is not intended to confer any benefits upon, or create any rights
in favor of, any Person (including, without limitation, any stockholder or debt
holder of the Company) other than the parties hereto, provided, that each of
the Purchaser Indemnitees that are not Purchasers and the Company Indemnitees
are entitled to all rights and benefits as third party beneficiaries of Section
7 of this Agreement; provided, further, that Placement Agent is intended to be
a beneficiary of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3
and the representations, warranties and acknowledgements set forth in Section
4A of this Agreement.

          8.13  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same document. The parties hereto confirm
that any facsimile copy of another party's executed counterpart of this
Agreement (or its signature page thereof) will be deemed to be an executed
original thereof.

          8.14  Exculpation Among Purchasers. Each Purchaser agrees that no
other Purchaser nor the respective controlling persons, officers, directors,
partners, agents or employees of any other Purchaser, nor Placement Agent,
shall be liable to such Purchaser for any losses incurred by such Purchaser in
connection with its investment in the Company.

          8.15  Expenses. At the Closing, the Company shall reimburse the
Purchasers for all fees and expenses incurred by them in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents up to a maximum
aggregate amount of $70,000, provided that the Company shall not be required to
pay any legal expenses of the Purchasers other than the fees and disbursements
of Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, counsel to certain of the Purchasers. The
Company shall also pay all stamp and other taxes and duties levied in
connection with the issuance of the Shares and the Warrants and, upon exercise
thereof, the Warrant Shares.
