               SKYTERRA ANNOUNCES $36.5 MILLION PRIVATE PLACEMENT

New York, NY December 27, 2004 - SkyTerra Communications, Inc. (OTC: SKYT)
today announced that, on December 23, 2004, it completed the sale of 2,000,000
shares of its common stock to a group of institutional investors at $18.25 per
share. SkyTerra received gross proceeds of $36.5 million which it expects to
use for general corporate purposes including future opportunities.

The sale of these shares was not registered under the Securities Act and the
shares may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an
applicable exemption from registration requirements. The shares were offered
and sold pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by Rule 506 under
the Securities Act and/or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

SkyTerra also announced that it expects to seek relisting on the Nasdaq
National Market during the first half of 2005 as a result of the increase in
stockholders' equity resulting from the transaction.

In connection with this sale, SkyTerra entered into a registration rights
agreement with the investors requiring that, among other things, SkyTerra
register the resale of the shares. If SkyTerra does not meet certain deadlines
between June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005 with respect to making the
registration effective, then warrants, which were issued to the investors in
connection with the transaction, to purchase up to an additional 600,000 shares
of common stock at an exercise price of $18.25 per share will vest and be
exercisable at any time through December 23, 2009. The number of warrants that
vest, if any, will depend on when the registration statement becomes effective.
If SkyTerra meets the June 30, 2005 deadline and otherwise complies with
certain registration obligations, none of the warrants will vest. In connection
with the transaction, SkyTerra also issued a warrant to purchase 110,000 shares
at an exercise price of $18.25 per share to the placement agent, which is
exercisable at any time through December 23, 2009.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to buy common stock. This press release is being issued pursuant to
and in accordance with Rule135c under the Securities Act.
