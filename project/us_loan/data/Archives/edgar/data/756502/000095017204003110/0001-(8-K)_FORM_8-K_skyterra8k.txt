Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On December 23, 2004, SkyTerra Communications, Inc. (the "Company") completed a
private placement of 2,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of its voting common
stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock") to a group of accredited
investors (the "Purchasers") at a per share price of $18.25, pursuant to the
terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement by and among the Company and each of
the Purchasers (the "Purchase Agreement"). In connection with this sale,
SkyTerra entered into a registration rights agreement with the Purchasers
requiring that, among other things, SkyTerra register the resale of the shares.
If SkyTerra does not meet certain deadlines between June 30, 2005 and December
31, 2005 with respect to making the registration effective, then warrants,
which were issued to the Purchasers in connection with the transaction, to
purchase up to an additional 600,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $18.25 per share (the "Warrants") will vest and be exercisable at any
time through December 23, 2009. The number of Warrants that vest, if any, will
depend on when the registration statement becomes effective. If SkyTerra meets
the June 30, 2005 deadline and otherwise complies with certain registration
obligations, none of the Warrants will vest. The aggregate purchase price for
the Shares and the Warrants sold in the private placement was $36.5 million,
before deducting expenses which are currently estimated to be approximately
$350,000 and placement agent fees of approximately $1,095,000. The Company
intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement for general
corporate purposes including to fund future opportunities.

In connection with the private placement, the Company issued to Tejas
Securities Group, Inc., as placement agent with respect to the transaction (the
"Placement Agent"), a warrant (the "Placement Agent Warrant") to purchase up to
an aggregate of 110,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $18.25
per share. The Placement Agent Warrant is exercisable immediately and will
expire on the fifth anniversary of the issue date. The Placement Agent is also
a party to the registration statement described above.

The sale of these shares was not registered under the Securities Act and the
shares may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an
applicable exemption from registration requirements. The shares were offered
and sold pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by Rule 506 under
the Securities Act and/or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

The foregoing is a summary of the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Registration
Rights Agreement, the Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrant and does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the
Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrant, copies of which are attached hereto
as Exhibit 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively.

On December 27, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing the private
placement. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is
incorporated into this current report by reference.


Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

The disclosure under Item 1.01 of this current report is also responsive to
this Item 3.02 and is incorporated herein by reference.


Section 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

The disclosure under Item 1.01 of the current report is also responsive to this
Item 7.01 and is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on December 27,
2004, SkyTerra also announced that it expects to seek relisting on the Nasdaq
National Market during the first half of 2005 as a result of the increase in
stockholders equity resulting from the transaction. No assurance can be given
that the Company will be successful in gaining such relisting.

Also attached as Exhibit 99.2, the Company is filing a description of certain
risk factors affecting the Company and its business.
