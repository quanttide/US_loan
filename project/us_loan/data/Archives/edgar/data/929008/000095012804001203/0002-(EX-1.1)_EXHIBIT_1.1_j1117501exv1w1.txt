      applicable form or statement specified by Treasury Department regulations
      in lieu thereof);

            (viii) In case such Selling Stockholder is the Management Selling
      Stockholder, certificates in negotiable form representing all of the
      Shares to be sold by such Selling Stockholder hereunder have been placed
      in custody under a Custody Agreement, in the form heretofore furnished to
      you (the "Custody Agreement"), duly executed and delivered by such Selling
      Stockholder to Mellon Investor Services LLC, as custodian (the
      "Custodian"), and such Selling Stockholder has duly executed and delivered
      a Power of Attorney, in the form heretofore furnished to you (the "Power
      of Attorney"), appointing the persons indicated in Schedule II hereto, and
      each of them, as such Selling Stockholder's attorneys-in-fact (the
      "Attorneys-in-Fact") with authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
      on behalf of such Selling Stockholder, to determine the purchase price to
      be paid by the Underwriters to the Selling Stockholders as provided in
      Section 2 hereof, to authorize the delivery of the Shares to be sold by
      such Selling Stockholder hereunder and otherwise to act on behalf of such
      Selling Stockholder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
      this Agreement and the Custody Agreement;

            (ix) In case such Selling Stockholder is the Management Selling
      Stockholder, the Shares represented by the certificates held in custody
      for such Selling Stockholder under the Custody Agreement are subject to
      the interests of the Underwriters hereunder; the

<PAGE>

      arrangements made by such Selling Stockholder for such custody, and the
      appointment by such Selling Stockholder of the Attorneys-in-Fact by the
      Power of Attorney, are to that extent irrevocable; and

            (x) The obligations of the Selling Stockholders hereunder shall not
      be terminated by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of
      any individual Selling Stockholder or, in the case of an estate or trust,
      by the death or incapacity of any executor or trustee or the termination
      of such estate or trust, or in the case of a partnership or corporation,
      by the dissolution of such partnership or corporation, or by the
      occurrence of any other event; if any individual Selling Stockholder or
      any such executor or trustee should die or become incapacitated, or if any
      such estate or trust should be terminated, or if any such partnership or
      corporation should be dissolved, or if any other such event should occur,
      before the delivery of the Shares hereunder, certificates representing the
      Shares shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholders in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, in the
      case such Selling Stockholder is the Management Selling Stockholder, of
      the Custody Agreement; and, in the case such Selling Stockholder is the
      Management Selling Stockholder, actions taken by the Attorneys-in-Fact
      pursuant to the Power of Attorney shall be as valid as if such death,
      incapacity, termination, dissolution or other event had not occurred,
      regardless of whether or not the Custodian, the Attorneys-in-Fact, or any
      of them, shall have received notice of such death, incapacity,
      termination, dissolution or other event.

      2. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, (a) the Company
and the Selling Stockholders, as and to the extent indicated in Schedule II
hereto, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, agree, severally and
not jointly, to sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters
agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company and each of the
Selling Stockholders, at a purchase price per share of $25.07, the number of
Firm Shares (to be adjusted by you so as to eliminate fractional shares)
determined by multiplying the aggregate number of Shares to be sold by the
Company and each of the Selling Stockholders as set forth opposite their
respective names in Schedule II hereto by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter as set
forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased by
all of the Underwriters from the Company and all of the Selling Stockholders
hereunder; (b) to the extent that the Underwriters shall exercise the election
to purchase Optional Shares as provided below, the Cypress Selling Stockholders
agree, severally and not jointly, to sell to each of the Underwriters, and each
of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from each of
the Cypress Selling Stockholders, at the purchase price per share set forth in
clause (a) of this Section 2, that portion of the initial 1,371,914 Optional
Shares as to which such election shall have been exercised (to be adjusted by
you so as to eliminate fractional shares) determined by multiplying such number
of Optional Shares by a fraction the numerator of which is the maximum number of
Optional Shares which such Underwriter is entitled to purchase as set forth
opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto and the denominator
of which is the maximum number of Optional Shares that all of the Underwriters
are entitled to purchase hereunder; and (c) to the extent that the Underwriters
shall exercise the election to purchase more than 1,371,914 Optional Shares in
the aggregate as provided below, the Company agrees to sell to each of the
Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to
purchase from such the Company, at the purchase price per share set forth in
clause (a) of this Section 2, up to 128,086 Optional Shares, as to which such
election shall have been exercised (to be adjusted by you so as to eliminate
fractional shares) determined by subtracting 1,371,914 Optional Shares from such
number of Optional Shares which such Underwriters elect to purchase.

      The Cypress Selling Stockholders, as and to the extent indicated in
Schedule II hereto, hereby grant, severally and not jointly, to the Underwriters
the right to purchase at their election up to


                                       8
<PAGE>

1,371,914 Optional Shares, and the Company hereby grants to the Underwriters the
right to purchase at their election up to 128,086 Optional Shares to the extent
that the Underwriters elect to purchase more than 1,371,914 Optional Shares in
the aggregate, at the purchase price per share set forth in the paragraph above,
for the sole purpose of covering sales of shares in excess of the number of Firm
Shares, provided that the purchase price per Optional Share shall be reduced by
an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the
Company and payable on the Firm Shares but not payable on the Optional Shares.
Any such election to purchase Optional Shares from the Cypress Selling
Stockholders shall be made in proportion to the maximum number of Optional
Shares to be sold by the Cypress Selling Stockholders as set forth in Schedule
II hereto. Any such election to purchase Optional Shares may be exercised only
by written notice from you to the Company and the Cypress Selling Stockholders,
given within a period of 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement and
setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Shares to be purchased and the
date on which such Optional Shares are to be delivered, as determined by you but
in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4
hereof) or, unless you, the Cypress Selling Stockholders and, if the Company is
selling Optional Shares pursuant to such election, the Company otherwise agree
in writing, earlier than two or later than ten business days after the date of
such notice.

      3. Upon the authorization by you of the release of the Firm Shares, the
several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Shares for sale upon the terms
and conditions set forth in the Prospectus.

      4. (a) The Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder, in
definitive form, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such
names as Lehman Brothers Inc. may request upon at least two business days' prior
notice to the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall be delivered by or on
behalf of the Company and the Selling Stockholders to Lehman Brothers Inc.,
through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), for the account
of such Underwriter, against payment by or on behalf of such Underwriter of the
purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the
account specified by the Company and the Custodian, as their interests may
appear, to Lehman Brothers Inc. at least two business days in advance. The
Company will cause the certificates representing the Shares to be made available
for checking and packaging at least two business days prior to the Time of
Delivery (as defined below) with respect thereto at the office of DTC or its
designated custodian (the "Designated Office"). The time and date of such
delivery and payment shall be, with respect to the Firm Shares, 9:30 a.m., New
York City time, on December 22, 2004 or such other time and date as Goldman,
Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., the Company and the Selling Stockholders may
agree upon in writing, and, with respect to the Optional Shares, 9:30 a.m., New
York City time, on the date specified by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman
Brothers Inc. in the written notice given by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman
Brothers Inc. of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Shares, or
such other time and date as Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., the
Cypress Selling Stockholders and, if the Company is selling Optional Shares
pursuant to such election, the Company may agree upon in writing. Such time and
date for delivery of the Firm Shares is herein called the "First Time of
Delivery", such time and date for delivery of the Optional Shares, if not the
First Time of Delivery, is herein called the "Second Time of Delivery", and each
such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery".

      (b) The documents to be delivered at each Time of Delivery by or on behalf
of the parties hereto pursuant to Section 7 hereof, including the cross receipt
for the Shares and any additional documents requested by the Underwriters
pursuant to Section 7(n) hereof, will be delivered at the offices of Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004 (the "Closing
Location"), and the Shares will be delivered at the Designated Office, all at
such Time of Delivery. A meeting will be held at the Closing Location at 3:00
p.m., New York City time, on the New York

<PAGE>

Business Day next preceding such Time of Delivery, at which meeting the final
drafts of the documents to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence will
be available for review by the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Section
4, "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

      5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters:

            (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in

      Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the
      Commission's close of business on the second business day following the
      execution and delivery of this Agreement, or, if applicable, such earlier
      time as may be required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; to make no further
      amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as
      amended or supplemented after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
      last Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by you promptly after
      reasonable notice thereof; to advise you promptly of any such amendment or
      supplement after any Time of Delivery for the Shares and furnish you with
      copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or
      information statements required to be filed by the Company with the
      Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
      Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the
      delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or
      sale of the Shares, and during such same period to advise you, promptly
      after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the
      Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any
      supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with
      the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of
      any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to
      the Shares, of the suspension of the qualification of the Shares for
      offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of
      any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission
      for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or
      Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the
      issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or
      suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Shares or suspending
      any such qualification, promptly to use its best efforts to obtain the
      withdrawal of such order;

            (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as you may
      reasonably request to qualify the Shares for offering and sale under the
      securities laws of such jurisdictions as you may request and to comply
      with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings
      therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete
      the distribution of the Shares, provided that in connection therewith the
      Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to
      file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

            (c) Prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the New York
      Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to
      time, to furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of
      the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in New York City in such
      quantities as you may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a
      prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale
      of the Shares and if at such time any events shall have occurred as a
      result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would
      include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
      material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus
      is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be
      necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or
      to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in
      the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act, to
      notify

      request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which
      will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;

            (d) To the extent not available via the Commission's Electronic
      Data, Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), to make

      Company, Rule 158);

      hereunder, any Stock, securities of the Company that are substantially
      similar to the Shares, including but not limited to any securities that
      are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to
      receive, Stock or any such substantially similar securities (other than
      pursuant to employee stock option plans existing on, or upon the
      conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities
      outstanding as of, the date of this Agreement), without the prior written
      consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. (the initial
      lock-up period will commence on the date hereof and will continue to and
      including the date 90 days after the date of the Prospectus; provided,
      however, that if (1) during the last 17 days of the initial lock-up period
      the Company releases earnings results or announces material news or a
      material event or (2) prior to the expiration of the initial lock-up
      period the Company announces that it will release earnings results during
      the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the initial lock-up period,
      then in each case the lock-up period will be automatically extended until
      the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of release of
      the earnings results or the announcement of the material news or material
      event, as applicable, unless Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc.
      waive, in writing, such extension (the "Lock-up Period");

            (f) To provide written notice to the Underwriters and to each of the
      Company's directors and executive officers and the stockholders listed in

      substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:

                  (i) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
            existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
            Delaware, with the corporate power and authority to own, lease and
            operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the
            Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

                  (ii) The Company has an authorized and outstanding
            capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or
            supplemented; all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital

            foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
            where the ownership or leasing of its properties or the conduct of
            its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
            to be so qualified and in good standing would not, individually or
            in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the financial
            condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the
            Company (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the
            opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect
            of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company).

                  (iv) Each of the Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation or
            limited liability company duly incorporated or organized, as the
            case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
            the State of Delaware, with the corporate or limited liability

            neither have a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
            results of operations, business or prospects of the Company or any
            of its Significant Subsidiaries nor interfere with the consummation
            of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in default in
            the performance or observance of (A) any indenture, mortgage, deed
            of trust, bank loan or credit agreement or other evidence of
            indebtedness, or (B) the terms of any license, lease, contract or

            filed by the Company since December 31, 2003.

                  (x) The information in the Prospectus under the headings
            "Description of Capital Securities," and "Plan of Distribution" and
            "Underwriting", insofar as such statements constitute a summary of
            documents or matters of law, are accurate in all material respects
            and present fairly the information required to be shown.

                  (xi) The Company is not an "investment company", as such term
            is defined in the Investment Company Act.

                  (xii) The documents incorporated by reference in the
            Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial
            statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel
            need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed
            with the Commission, as the case may be, together, where applicable,
            with any amendments in respect thereof, complied as to form in all
            material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange

            with the requirements of the 1933 Act.

            Such counsel shall further state that on the basis of the foregoing,
            nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes such
            counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it
            became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact
            or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
            necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the
            Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the date of
            such Prospectus, such amendment or such supplement, and at such Time
            of Delivery, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
            omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
            necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
            circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being
            understood that such counsel is expressing no opinion with respect
            to the financial statements and related notes and schedules, and
            other financial data included in or omitted from the Registration
            Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto).

            Selling Stockholder of this Agreement, the Custody Agreement and the
            Power of Attorney and the sale of the Shares to be sold by the

            Selling Stockholder known to such counsel that (1) names the

            Management Selling Stockholder or any of his property and (2)
            expressly and adversely affects the title to the Shares to be sold
            by the Management Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement or
            the ability of the Management Selling Stockholder to perform his

            Power of Attorney, except for such breaches, violations, defaults,
            liens, charges and encumbrances which would not, individually or in
            the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
            Management Selling Stockholder to consummate the sale of the Shares
            by the Management Selling Stockholder or perform the Management
            Selling Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement, the Custody
            Agreement and the Power of Attorney.

                  (v) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration
            or qualification of, or filing with, any third party (whether acting

      in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of
      Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. so material and adverse as

      States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause
      (iv) or (v) in the judgment of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers
      Inc. makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public
      offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at such Time of
      Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;

amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case
to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to
the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Selling
Stockholder expressly for use therein in the preparation of the answers therein
to Item 7 of Form S-3; and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are
incurred; provided, however, that such Selling Stockholder shall not be liable
in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any
preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any
such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs &
Co. expressly for use therein; provided, further, that the liability of each
Selling Stockholder pursuant to this subsection (b) shall not exceed the product
of the number of Shares sold by such Selling Stockholder, including any Optional
Shares, and the initial public offering price of the Shares as set forth on the
cover page of the Prospectus.


                                       19

      (c) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each
Selling Stockholder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which
the Company or such Selling Stockholder may become subject, under the Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any
preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case
to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to
the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter
through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the
Company and each Selling Stockholder for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by the Company or such Selling Stockholder in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are
incurred.

      (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a),
(b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such
action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not,
except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying
party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall
not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the
written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise
of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or
potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all
liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a
statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or
on behalf of any indemnified party.

      (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a),
(b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the
allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by
applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required
under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such


                                       20
<PAGE>

proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also
the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand
and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the
one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders bear to the total
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each
case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative
fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company
or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, each of the
Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for
such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten
by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the
amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters'
obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to
their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.

      (f) The obligations of the Company and the Selling Stockholders under this
Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the
respective Selling Stockholders may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the
same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under
this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective
Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if
any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of
the Act.

      9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the
Shares which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may
in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase
such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such
default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares,
then the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall be entitled to a further
period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other
parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event
that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company and the
Selling Stockholders that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares,
or the Company and the Selling Stockholders notify you that they have so
arranged for the purchase of such Shares, you or the Company and the Selling
Stockholders shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for a period of
not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be
made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees
to file promptly any amendments or


                                       21
<PAGE>

supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your
opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this
Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like
effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with
respect to such Shares.

      (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company and
the Selling Stockholders as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate
number of such Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of
the aggregate number of all the Shares to be purchased at such Time of Delivery,
then the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall have the right to require
each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares which such
Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in
addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata
share (based on the number of Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase
hereunder) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for
which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a
defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

      (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company and
the Selling Stockholders as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate
number of such Shares which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the
aggregate number of all of the Shares to be purchased at such Time of Delivery,
or if the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall not exercise the right
described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to
purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement
(or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the
Underwriters to purchase and of the Company and the Cypress Selling Stockholders
to sell the Optional Shares) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the
part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Selling
Stockholders, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Selling
Stockholders and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the
indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

      10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the several
Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them,
respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof)
made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any
Underwriter, or the Company, or any of the Selling Stockholders, or any officer
or director or controlling person of the Company, or any controlling person of
any Selling Stockholder, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the
Shares.

      11. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof,
neither the Company nor the Selling Stockholders shall then be under any
liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but,
if for any other reason any Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the
Company and the Selling Stockholders as provided herein, the Company and each of
the Selling Stockholders pro rata (based on the number of Shares to be sold by
the Company and such Selling Stockholder hereunder), will reimburse the
Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by
you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the
Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the
Shares not so delivered, but the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall then
be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of the Shares not so
delivered except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.

      12. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the
Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any
statement, request, notice or agreement on


                                       22
<PAGE>

behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by Goldman, Sachs &
Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. on behalf of you as the representatives; and in all
dealings with the Management Selling Stockholder hereunder, you and the Company
shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or
agreement on behalf of the Management Selling Stockholder made or given by any
or all of the Attorneys-in-Fact for the Management Selling Stockholder.

      All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in
writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs &
Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration
Department, and Lehman Brothers Inc., 745 7th Avenue, New York, New York 10019,

under Section 8, also to Lehman Brothers Inc., 399 Park Avenue, 10th Floor, New
York, New York 10022, Attention: Director of Litigation, Office of General
Counsel (Fax: 212-520-0421)); if to any Selling Stockholder shall be delivered
or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to counsel for such Selling
Stockholder at its address set forth in Schedule II hereto; and if to the
Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to
the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention:
Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to
Section 8(d) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile
transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters'
Questionnaire or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be
supplied to the Company or the Selling Stockholders by you on request. Any such
statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt
thereof.

      13. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit
of, the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Stockholders and, to the
extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the
Company and each person who controls the Company, any Selling Stockholder or any
Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by
virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter
shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

      14. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the
term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in
Washington, D.C. is open for business.

      15. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

      16. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties
hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument.

      17. The Company and the Selling Stockholders are authorized, subject to
applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction
that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to
be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind
(including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits,
without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.

      If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and
return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on
behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall
constitute a binding agreement among each of the Underwriters, the Company and
each of the Selling Stockholders. It is understood that your acceptance of this
letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set
forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be

your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

      FORM OF OPINION OF KIRKPATRICK & LOCKHART LLP, COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY

         We have acted as counsel to WESCO International, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the sale by the Company today of
an aggregate of _________ shares (the "Shares") of the Company's Common Stock,
$.01 par value ("Common Stock"), consisting of 4,000,000 initial shares of
Common Stock [and [_________] additional shares of Common Stock relating to the
exercise [in full][in part] by the Underwriters of their over-allotment option],
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated December 16, 2004 (the
"Underwriting Agreement") by and among the Company, the selling stockholders
named in Schedule II thereto (the "Selling Stockholders") and the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters"). We are delivering
this opinion letter to you at the Company's request pursuant to Section 7(c) of
the Underwriting Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used
but not defined in this opinion letter have the meanings given them in the
Underwriting Agreement.

         Concurrently, the Selling Stockholders are selling an aggregate of
[6,000,000] shares of Common Stock, consisting of 6,000,000 initial shares of
Common Stock and [_________] additional shares of Common Stock relating to the
exercise [in full][in part] by the Underwriters of their over-allotment option],
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.

         We are familiar with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No.
333-119909), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") on October 22, 2004 under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended,
and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1933 Act"), with Amendment Nos. 1
and 2 thereto, filed on November 29, 2004 and December 3, 2004, respectively,
and with the Prospectus dated December 6, 2004 and the Prospectus Supplement
dated December 16, 2004, each relating to that Registration Statement. In this
opinion letter, that Registration Statement, as amended at the time it became
effective, is referred to as the "Registration Statement", and that Prospectus
Supplement and accompanying Prospectus in the form filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act on December 17, 2004 are referred to
together as the "Prospectus."

         In connection with rendering the opinions set forth below, we have
examined (i) the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the Company's Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and By-laws, (iii) resolutions adopted by the Company's Board
of Directors on October 15, 2004 and December 5, 2004 and by the Pricing
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors on December 16, 2004, each
relating to the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Company and the Selling
Stockholders pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and (iv) the respective
Certificates of Incorporation and By-laws, or Certificate of Formation and
Limited Liability Company Agreement, as applicable, of each "Significant
Subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X and listed on Annex
1(a)(iv) of the Underwriting Agreement (the "Significant Subsidiaries")), and we
have made such other investigation as we have deemed appropriate. We have
examined and relied on certificates of and telephonic conversations with public
officials and, as to certain matters of fact that are material to our opinions,
we have also examined and relied on a certificate of an officer of the Company
(the "Fact Certificate") (a copy of which is attached to this opinion letter),
the representations of the Company set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, and
certificates, opinions and other documents delivered by or on the behalf of the
Company pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. We have not independently
established any of the facts so relied on.
<PAGE>
         For the purposes of this opinion letter, we have made the assumptions
that are customary in opinion letters of this kind, including the assumptions
that each document submitted to us is accurate and complete, that each such
document that is an original is authentic, that each such document that is a
copy conforms to an authentic original, that all signatures (other than
signatures on behalf of the Company) on each such document are genuine, and that
no changes in the facts certified in the Fact Certificate have occurred or will
occur after the date of the Fact Certificate. We have further assumed the legal
capacity of natural persons, and we have assumed that each party to the
Underwriting Agreement (other than the Company) has the legal capacity and has
satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to that party to the extent
necessary to make the Underwriting Agreement enforceable against that party. We
have not verified any of the foregoing assumptions. References in this opinion
letter to our knowledge or our attention mean a conscious awareness of facts by
any of the lawyers currently with this firm who have given substantive attention
to legal representation of the Company in matters relating directly to the
Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (the
"Transaction Lawyers") after consultation with such other lawyers currently with
this firm as deemed appropriate by the Transaction Lawyers, and the phrase
"causes us to believe" means that we have formed a conscious belief on the basis
of information that has come to our attention.

         During the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus, we participated in conferences with representatives of the
Company, including certain of its executive, financial and accounting officers,
representatives of its independent public accountants, and representatives of
the Underwriters, including your counsel, at which conferences the contents of
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were
discussed. Between the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement and
the date hereof, we participated in further discussions with representatives of
the Company and representatives of the Underwriters, including your counsel,
regarding the contents of certain portions of the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus and related matters, and reviewed certificates of certain officers of
the Company, and a letter addressed to you from the Company's independent public
accountants. We have relied as to materiality to a large extent on statements
made by officers and other representatives of the Company at those conferences.
We have not independently verified any information, including financial,
accounting or statistical information, included in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus.

         The opinions expressed in this opinion letter are limited to (i) the
law of the State of New York, other than its law relating to choice of law; (ii)
law of the United States; (iii) solely with respect to the opinions in numbered
paragraphs 1, 2, 4 (with regard to all Significant Subsidiaries other than CDW
Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CDW")), 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
below, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; and (iv) solely
with respect to the opinion in numbered paragraph 4, 7 and 9 (with regard solely
to CDW) below, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. We are not opining
on, and we assume no responsibility with respect to, the applicability to or
effect on any of the matters covered herein of the laws of any other
jurisdiction, or the laws of any county, municipality or other political
subdivision or local governmental agency or authority.

         Based on the foregoing, and subject to the foregoing and the additional
qualifications and other matters set forth below, it is our opinion that:

         1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its
business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
<PAGE>
         2. The Company has an authorized and outstanding capitalization as set
forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (including the Shares) have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
and the Shares conform to the description of the Stock contained in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

         3. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or
leasing of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the
Company (with your permission, we have relied in respect of matters of fact
related to the opinion in this paragraph upon a certificate of an officer of the
Company).

         4. Each of the Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited
liability company duly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the
corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as the case may be,
to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as
described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
Significant Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
paid and non-assessable and, except as otherwise stated in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented, are owned by the Company.

         5. To the best of our knowledge without investigation, there are no
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings pending or overtly
threatened in writing to which the Company or any of the Significant
Subsidiaries is or would be a party or to which any of their respective
properties is subject which are required to be described in the Registration
Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented but are not so described.

         6. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company.

         7. The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting
Agreement by the Company, the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby do not
and will not result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default under
(nor constitute any event which with notice, lapse of time or both would result
in any breach or violation of or constitute a default under) (A) the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or the similar charter
documents of any of the Significant Subsidiaries, (B) (i) any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, bank loan or credit agreement or other evidence of
indebtedness, or (ii) the terms of any license, lease, contract or other
agreement or instrument filed or required to be filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2003, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 and any
Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company since December 31, 2003, (C) the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the laws of the State of New
York or any applicable statute, regulation or rule of the United States, or (D)
to our knowledge, any decree, judgment or order applicable by its terms to the
Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries.
<PAGE>
         8. Except as disclosed in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, no
approval, authorization, consent or order of or filing with any federal, state
or local governmental or regulatory commission, board, body, authority or agency
is required in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby other than
registration of the Shares under the Act (except we express no opinion as to any
necessary qualification under the state securities or blue sky laws of the
various jurisdictions in which the Shares are being offered by the
Underwriters).

         9. Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is (i)
in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or its Certificate
of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement, as the case may be, or
(ii) except where such violation or noncompliance, individually or in the
aggregate, would neither have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company nor
interfere with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Underwriting Agreement, in default in the performance or observance of (A) any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, bank loan or credit agreement or other
evidence of indebtedness, or (B) the terms of any license, lease, contract or
other agreement or instrument, filed or required to be filed as an exhibit to
the Registration Statement or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 and any
Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company since December 31, 2003.

         10. The information in the Prospectus under the headings "Description
of Capital Securities," and "Plan of Distribution", insofar as such statements
constitute a summary of documents or matters of law, and "Underwriting", insofar
as such statements constitute a summary of documents, are accurate in all
material respects and present fairly the information required to be shown.

         11. The Company is not an "investment company", as such term is defined
in the Investment Company Act.

         12. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related
schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they
became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be,
together, where applicable, with any amendments in respect thereof, complied as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, as applicable.

         13. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented (except as to the financial statements and schedules and other
financial data contained therein, as to which we express no opinion) comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act.

         We are not opining as to factual matters, and are not passing upon and
do not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the
information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and have
not made independent investigation of that information (other than as
specifically stated above). We can advise you, however, that on the basis of the
foregoing, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the date of such
Prospectus or such amendment or such supplement, and on the date hereof,
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or
<PAGE>
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that we express
no opinion with respect to the financial statements and related notes and
schedules, and other financial data included in or omitted from the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, or any supplement or amendment thereto).

         We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely in connection with
the issuance and sale of the Shares. You may not rely on this opinion letter in
any other connection, and it may not be furnished to or relied upon by any other
person for any purpose, without our specific prior written consent.

         The foregoing opinions are rendered as of the date of this letter. We
assume no obligation to update or supplement any of such opinions to reflect any
changes of law or fact that may occur.

                                                                      ANNEX 7(D)

                 FORM OF OPINION OF KIRKPATRICK & LOCKHART LLP,
                  COUNSEL TO THE MANAGEMENT SELLING STOCKHOLDER

         We have acted as special counsel to the individual selling stockholder
identified in Schedule I attached to this opinion letter (the "Management
Selling Stockholder") in connection with their sale today of an aggregate of
550,000 shares (the "Shares") of Common Stock, $.01 par value ("Common Stock"),
of WESCO International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant
to the Underwriting Agreement dated December 16, 2004 (the "Underwriting
Agreement") by and among the Company, the selling stockholders named in Schedule
II thereto and the several Underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the
"Underwriters"). We are delivering this opinion letter to you at the request of
the Company and the Management Selling Stockholder pursuant to Section 7(d) of
the Underwriting Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used
but not defined in this opinion letter have the meanings given to them in the
Underwriting Agreement.

         Concurrently, the Company is issuing and selling an aggregate of
4,000,000 initial shares of Common Stock [and [_________] additional shares of
Common Stock relating to the exercise [in full][in part] by the Underwriters of
their over-allotment option], pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and
Cypress Merchant Banking Partners L.P. and Cypress Offshore Partners L.P. are
selling an aggregate of [_________] initial shares of Common Stock [and
[_________] additional shares of Common Stock relating to the exercise [in
full][in part] by the Underwriters of their over-allotment option], pursuant to
the Underwriting Agreement.

         In connection with rendering the opinions set forth below, we have
examined (i) the Underwriting Agreement; (ii) the Management Selling
Stockholder's Power of Attorney dated on or before December 16, 2004 (the "Power
of Attorney") executed by the Management Selling Stockholder; (iii) the Custody
Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "Custody Agreement") between Mellon
Investor Services LLC, as custodian, and the Management Selling Stockholder;
(iv) the factual certificates of the Management Selling Stockholder dated
December [22], 2004; and (v) such other documents, instruments and certificates
delivered by or on behalf of the Management Selling Stockholder and have
examined questions of law as we have deemed necessary in order to render this
opinion letter. We have relied on the representations of the Management Selling
Stockholder set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, Power of Attorney and
Custody Agreement and have not independently established any of the facts so
relied on.

         For purposes of this opinion letter, we have made assumptions that are
customary in opinion letters of this kind, including the assumptions that each
document submitted to us is accurate and complete, that each such document that
is an original is authentic, that each such document conforms to an authentic
original, that all signatures on each such document are genuine, and that no
changes in the facts certified in the certificates set forth in the preceding
paragraph have occurred or will occur after the dates of such certificates. We
have further assumed the legal capacity of natural persons, and we have assumed
that each party to each document we have examined has the legal capacity and has
satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to that party to the extent
necessary to make such document enforceable against that party. We have not
verified any of the foregoing assumptions. References in this opinion letter to
our knowledge or our attention mean a conscious awareness of facts by any of the
lawyers currently with this firm who have given substantive attention to legal
representation of the Company and the Management Selling Stockholder in matters
relating directly to the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement
<PAGE>
and the Prospectus (the "Transaction Lawyers") after consultation with such
other lawyers currently with this firm as deemed appropriate by the Transaction
Lawyers.

         The opinions expressed in this opinion letter are limited to (i) the
law of the State of New York, other than its law relating to choice of law and
(ii) federal law of the United States. We are not opining on, and we assume no
responsibility with respect to, the applicability to or effect on any of the
matters covered herein of the laws of any other jurisdiction, or the laws of any
county, municipality or other political subdivision or local governmental agency
or authority.

         Based on the foregoing, and subject to the foregoing and the additional
qualifications and other matters set forth below, it is our opinion that:

         1. The Management Selling Stockholder has individual power and
authority to enter into the Underwriting Agreement, the Custody Agreement and
the Power of Attorney and to sell, assign, transfer and deliver the Shares
delivered by the Management Selling Stockholder on the date hereof.

         2. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on
behalf of the Management Selling Stockholder. A Power of Attorney and a Custody
Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by the Management Selling
Stockholder and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Management Selling Stockholder enforceable against the Management Selling
Stockholder in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

         3. The Management Selling Stockholder is the registered owner of the
Shares to be sold; assuming the several Underwriters purchase the Shares
delivered by the Management Selling Stockholder for value and without notice of
any adverse claim, as such term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code as
currently in effect, the delivery of certificates representing such Shares will
pass to the Underwriters on the date hereof all rights in such Shares, free of
any adverse claims within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code as
currently in effect.

         4. The execution, delivery and performance by the Management Selling
Stockholder of the Underwriting Agreement, the Custody Agreement and the Power
of Attorney and the sale of the Shares to be sold by the Management Selling
Stockholder thereunder will not result in a breach or violation of any of the
terms and provisions of, and will not constitute a default under, and will not
result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon the
Shares to be sold by the Management Selling Stockholder under (A) any agreement
or instrument known to us to which the Management Selling Stockholder is a party
or by which the Management Selling Stockholder is bound or to which any of the
property or assets of the Management Selling Stockholder is subject, (B) any
federal statute, rule or regulation or existing law, rule or regulation
applicable to the Management Selling Stockholder, or (C) the terms of any
judgment, order or decree of any government, governmental agency or body, or
court having jurisdiction over the Management Selling Stockholder known to such
counsel that (1) names the Management Selling Stockholder and is specifically
directed to the Management Selling Stockholder or any of his property and (2)
expressly and adversely affects the title to the Shares to be sold by the
Management Selling Stockholder pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement or the
ability of the Management Selling Stockholder to perform his obligations under
the Underwriting Agreement, the Custody Agreement and the Power of Attorney,
except for such breaches, violations, defaults, liens, charges and encumbrances
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Management Selling Stockholder to consummate the
sale of the Shares by the Management Selling Stockholder or
<PAGE>
perform the Management Selling Stockholder's obligations under the Underwriting
Agreement, the Custody Agreement and the Power of Attorney.

         5. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or
qualification of, or filing with, any third party (whether acting in an
individual, fiduciary or other capacity) or any governmental or regulatory
agency or body or any court is required to be obtained or made by the Management
Selling Stockholder for the consummation of the sale of the Shares by the
Management Selling Stockholder and of the transactions contemplated by the
Underwriting Agreement, except such as have been obtained and made or are
required under the Securities Act and such as may be required under state
securities laws in connection with the sale or distribution of the Shares (as to
which we express no opinion).

         We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely in connection with
the sale of the Shares. You may not rely on this opinion letter in any other
connection, and it may not be furnished to or relied upon by any other person
for any purpose, without our specific prior written consent.

         The foregoing opinions are rendered as of the date of this letter. We
assume no obligation to update or supplement any of such opinions to reflect any
changes of law or facts that may occur.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel to certain selling stockholders of WESCO
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") named in Schedule II
(the selling stockholders named therein are collectively referred to as the
"Selling Stockholders") to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below), in
connection with the purchase by you of an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of
Common Stock, $.01 par value (the "Shares"), of the Company, from the Company
and the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated
December 16, 2004 among you (collectively, the "Underwriters"), the Company and
the Selling Stockholders (the "Underwriting Agreement").

         We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.
333-119909) filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act (the
"Registration Statement"); the Company's prospectus dated December 6, 2004, as
supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated December 16, 2004 (the
"Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under
the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference or is
deemed to incorporate by reference the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004,
the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed on July 15, 2004 and October
21, 2004 and the Company's Registration Statement on Form 8-A, filed on May 4,
1999, each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and
the Underwriting Agreement. We also have examined a copy of a certificate
representing the Common Stock of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and
have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the
closing and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of
such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such
certificates or comparable documents or oral statements of public officials and
of officers and representatives of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, and
have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary in
connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.

         In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures,
the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all
documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the
authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In addition, in
connection with our
<PAGE>
opinion set forth in paragraph 1 below, we have assumed that (i) The Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") is a "securities intermediary" as defined in Section 8-102
of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (the "New
York UCC"), and the State of New York is the "securities intermediary's
jurisdiction" of DTC for purposes of Section 8-110 of the New York UCC, (ii) the
Shares are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, and DTC or another
person acting on behalf of DTC maintains possession of certificates representing
the Shares, (iii) DTC indicates by book entries on its books that security
entitlements with respect to the Shares have been credited to the Underwriters'
securities accounts and (iv) the Underwriters are purchasing the Shares without
notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of the New York UCC).

         In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph 1 below, we have also
assumed that (i) Cypress Offshore Partners L.P. ("Cypress Offshore") is validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Underwriting
Agreement in accordance with its organizational documents and the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized, (ii) execution, delivery and performance
by Cypress Offshore of the Underwriting Agreement does not the violate the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or any applicable jurisdiction
other than the State of New York and (iii) execution, delivery and performance
by Cypress Offshore of the Underwriting Agreement does not constitute a breach
or violation of any agreement or instrument which is binding upon Cypress
Offshore.

         Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications,
assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:

                  1. Cypress Merchant Banking Partners L.P. ("Cypress", and
         together with Cypress Offshore, the "Cypress Selling Stockholders") has
         full partnership power, right and authority to sell the Shares to be
         sold by Cypress. Upon the payment and transfer contemplated by the
         Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters will acquire a security
         entitlement with respect to the Shares to be sold by the Cypress
         Selling Stockholders and no action based on an adverse claim may be
         asserted against the Underwriters.

                  2. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and
         delivered by or on behalf of Cypress and by Cypress Associates L.P.,
         the general partner of Cypress (the "General Partner").

                  3. The sale of the Shares by Cypress and the compliance by
         Cypress with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will
         not breach or result in a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed
         of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument identified on
         the annexed schedule furnished to us by Cypress and which Cypress has
         represented lists all material agreements and instruments to which
         Cypress is a party or by which Cypress is bound, nor will such action
         violate the organizational documents of Cypress or the General Partner
         or any federal or New York State statute or the Delaware Revised
         Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any rule or regulation that has been
         issued pursuant to any federal or New York State statute or the
         Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any order known to
         us issued pursuant to any federal or New York State statute or the
         Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act by any court or
         governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over Cypress or the
         General Partner or any of their respective properties.

                  4. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or
         qualification of or with any federal or New York State governmental
         agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting
         pursuant to the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or, to
         our knowledge, any federal or New York State court or any Delaware
         court acting pursuant to the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited
         Partnership Act is required for the sale of the Shares by each of the
         Cypress Selling Stockholders and the compliance by each of the Cypress
<PAGE>
         Selling Stockholders with all of the provisions of the Underwriting
         Agreement, except for the registration under the Securities Act of the
         Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
         qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky
         laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by
         the Underwriters.

         We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the
law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States and the
Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.

         This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the
above-described transaction. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you
for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person,
firm or corporation without our prior written consent.

                           FORM OF OPINION OF WALKERS,
                    COUNSEL TO CYPRESS OFFSHORE PARTNERS L.P.

[Date] December 2004


To the persons set out in Schedule 4

Dear Sirs

CYPRESS OFFSHORE PARTNERS L.P (THE "PARTNERSHIP")

We have been asked to provide this legal opinion to you with regard to the laws
of the Cayman Islands pursuant to Section 7(f) of the Underwriting Agreement,
dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among WESCO
International, Inc., the selling stockholders named in Schedule II thereto and
the underwriters named in Schedule I thereto, being entered into by Cypress
Associates L.P. (the "COMPANY") as general partner of the Partnership, a Cayman
Islands Exempted Limited Partnership. The limited partners and founding limited
partners from time to time of the Partnership are collectively referred to in
this opinion as the "LIMITED PARTNERS" and references to the Partnership in this
opinion shall be deemed to be references to the Company in its capacity as
general partner of the Partnership, except where the context otherwise requires.

For the purposes of giving this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the
originals, copies or certified translations of the documents and instruments
listed in Schedule 1.

In giving this opinion we have relied upon the assumptions set out in Schedule
2, which we have not independently verified.

We are attorneys-at-law in the Cayman Islands and express no opinion as to any
laws other than the laws of the Cayman Islands in force and as interpreted at
the date of this opinion. We have not, for the purposes of this opinion, made
any investigation of the laws, rules or regulations of any other jurisdiction.
Except as explicitly stated herein, we express no opinion in relation to any
representation or warranty contained in the Underwriting Agreement nor upon the
commercial terms of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.

Based upon the foregoing examinations and assumptions and upon such searches as
we have conducted and having regard to legal considerations which we deem
relevant, and subject to the qualifications set out in Schedule 3 we are of the
opinion that under the laws of the Cayman Islands:

1.       The Partnership is an exempted limited partnership duly formed,
         registered, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
         Cayman Islands. Based solely upon our review of the register of limited
         partnership interests of the Partnership, the Company is the general
         partner of the Partnership.

2.       The Partnership has power and authority to purchase, own and dispose of
         property and conduct its business as provided in the Partnership
         Agreement (as defined in Schedule 1).

3.       The Company is an exempted company duly incorporated, validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Company
         has full corporate power, and authority to execute and deliver the
         Underwriting Agreement to be executed by it and to
<PAGE>
         perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement in its own
         right and as general partner of the Partnership.

4.       The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement
         to which the Partnership is a party or to which the Company is a party,
         as general partner of the Partnership , and the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated thereby and the compliance by the Company and
         the Partnership with the terms and provisions thereof, including the
         sale by the Partnership of up to 334,432 shares, $.01 par value, of
         WESCO International, Inc. (the "Shares") pursuant to the terms of the
         Underwriting Agreement, do not:

         (a)      contravene any law, public rule or regulation of the Cayman
                  Islands applicable to the Company or the Partnership which is
                  currently in force;

         (b)      contravene the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the
                  Company; or

         (c)      contravene the Partnership Agreement of the Partnership.

5.       Neither the execution, delivery or performance of the Underwriting
         Agreement to which the Company or the Partnership is a party nor the
         consummation or performance of any of the transactions contemplated
         thereby by the Company or the Partnership, including the sale of the
         Shares pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, requires the consent or
         approval of, the giving of notice to, or the registration with, or the
         taking of, any other action in respect of any Cayman Islands
         governmental or judicial authority or agency.

6.       The Underwriting Agreement to which the Partnership is a party has been
         duly authorised, executed and delivered by the Company as general
         partner of the Partnership and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
         obligations of the Partnership enforceable against the Partnership in
         accordance with their respective terms.

7.       The law chosen in the Underwriting Agreement to govern its
         interpretation would be upheld as a valid choice of law in any action
         on the Underwriting Agreement in the courts of the Cayman Islands.

8.       There are no stamp duties (other than the stamp duties mentioned in
         qualification 2 in Schedule 3), income taxes, withholdings, levies,
         registration taxes, or other duties or similar taxes or charges now
         imposed, or which under the present laws of the Cayman Islands could in
         the future become imposed, in connection with the enforcement or
         admissibility in evidence of the Underwriting Agreement, activities of
         the Partnership contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or on any
         payment or distribution to be made by the Company, or the Partnership,
         or any other person pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The Cayman
         Islands currently have no form of income, corporate or capital gains
         tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.

9.       None of the parties to the Underwriting Agreement (other than the
         Company and the Partnership) is or will be deemed to be resident,
         domiciled or carrying on business in the Cayman Islands by reason only
         of the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the
         Underwriting Agreement to which any of them is party.

10.      A judgment obtained in a foreign court will be recognised and enforced
         in the courts of the Cayman Islands without any re-examination of the
         merits at common law, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment
         debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, where
<PAGE>
         the judgment is final and in respect of which the foresign court had
         jurisdiction over the defendant according to Cayman Islands conflict of
         law rules and which is conclusive, for a liquidated sum not in respect
         of penalties or taxes or a fine or similar fiscal or revenue
         obligations, and which was neither obtained in a manner, nor is of a
         kind enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public
         policy of the Cayman Islands.

11.      It is not necessary under the laws of the Cayman Islands (i) in order
         to enable any party to the Underwriting Agreement to enforce their
         rights under the Underwriting Agreement or (ii) solely by reason of the
         execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement that
         any party to the Underwriting Agreement should be licensed, qualified
         or otherwise entitled to carry on business in the Cayman Islands or any
         other political subdivision thereof.

12.      The Company and the Partnership are subject to civil and commercial law
         with respect to their obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and
         neither the Company nor the Partnership nor any of their assets are
         entitled to immunity from suit or enforcement of a judgment on the
         grounds of sovereignty or otherwise in the courts of the Cayman Islands
         in proceedings against the Company or the Partnership in respect of any
         obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, which obligations
         constitute private and commercial acts rather than governmental or
         public acts.

13.      Based solely upon our examination of the Cause List and the Register of
         Writs and other Originating Process of the Grand Court of the Cayman
         Islands conducted on [date] December 2004 (the "SEARCH DATE"), we
         confirm that there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against
         the Company or the Partnership before the Grand Court of the Cayman
         Islands and no steps have been, or are being, taken to compulsorily
         wind up the Company or dissolve the Partnership and based solely upon
         our examination of the records of the Company referred to in this
         opinion no resolution voluntarily to wind up the Company has been
         adopted by its members.

14.      A judgment of a court in the Cayman Islands may be expressed in a
         currency other than Cayman Islands dollars.

This opinion is limited to the matters referred to herein and shall not be
construed as extending to any other matter or document not referred to herein.
This opinion is given solely for your benefit and the benefit of your legal
advisers acting in that capacity in relation to this transaction, and may not be
relied upon by any other person without our prior written consent.

This opinion shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman
Islands.

Yours faithfully

WALKERS

                                   ASSUMPTIONS

This opinion is given based upon the following assumptions:

1. There are no provisions of the laws of any jurisdiction outside the Cayman
Islands which would be contravened by the execution or delivery of the
Underwriting Agreement and insofar as any obligation expressed to be incurred
under the Underwriting Agreement is to be performed in or is otherwise subject
to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands, its performance will
not be illegal by virtue of the laws of that jurisdiction.

2. The Underwriting Agreement is within the capacity, power, and legal right of
and have been or will be duly authorised, executed and delivered by, each of the
parties thereto (other than the Company and the Partnership) and constitute or
when executed and delivered, will constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of each of the parties thereto enforceable in accordance with their
terms as a matter of the laws of all other relevant jurisdictions (other than
the Cayman Islands).

3. The choice of the laws of the jurisdiction selected to govern the
Underwriting Agreement has been made in good faith and will be regarded as a
valid and binding selection that will be upheld in the courts of that
jurisdiction and all other relevant jurisdictions (other than the Cayman
Islands).

4. All authorisations, approvals, consents, licences and exemptions required by,
and all filings and other requirements of, each of the parties to the
Underwriting Agreement outside the Cayman Islands to ensure the legality,
validity and enforceability of the Underwriting Agreement has been or will be
duly obtained, made or fulfilled and are and will remain in full force and
effect and any conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.

5. All conditions precedent, if any, contained in the Underwriting Agreement
have been or will be satisfied or waived.

6. The board of directors of the Company consider the execution of the
Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby to be in the
best interests of the Company and the Partnership.

7. No disposition of property effected by the Underwriting Agreement is made for
an improper purpose or wilfully to defeat an obligation owed to a creditor and
at an undervalue.

8. Each of the Company and the Partnership was on the date of execution of the
Underwriting Agreement to which it is a party able to pay its debts as they
became due from its own moneys, and any disposition or settlement of property
effected by the Underwriting Agreement is made in good faith and for valuable
consideration and at the time of each disposition of property by the Company and
the Partnership pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement the Company will be able
to pay its debts and those of the Partnership as they become due from its own
moneys or those of the Partnership, as the case may be.

9. The originals of all documents examined in connection with this opinion are
authentic, all seals thereon and the signatures and initials thereon of any
person authorised to execute the Underwriting Agreement are genuine, all such
documents purporting to be sealed have been so sealed, all copies are complete
and conform to their originals.
<PAGE>
10. The Memorandum and Articles of Association reviewed by us are the Memorandum
and Articles of Association of the Company in force at the date hereof and the
Partnership Agreement reviewed by us is the Partnership Agreement of the
Partnership in force at the date hereof and each of the parties to the
Partnership Agreement has duly executed and delivered the same.

11. The copies of the Minute Book, Register of Members, Register of Directors
and Register of Officers, Register of Mortgages and Charges, Certificate of
Incorporation, and Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company
provided to us by its registered office are true and correct copies of the
originals of the same and are complete and accurate and constitute a complete
and accurate record of the business transacted by the Company and all matters
required by law and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to
be recorded therein are so recorded.

12. The Partnership records, including the Certificate of Registration of the
Partnership, the Register of Limited Partnership Interests and the Register of
Mortgages of Limited Partnership Interests, provided to us by its registered

constitute a complete record of the proceedings before the Grand Court of the
Cayman Islands.

14. No withdrawal, removal or deemed act of withdrawal or removal of a general
partner of the Partnership has taken place. We confirm that nothing in the
materials examined by us suggests that any such event has taken place.

15. The meeting of the board of directors at which the Resolutions were duly
adopted was called and held in accordance with the Articles of Association of
the Company.

16. No action or event (including the expiry of a time period) has taken place

                                   SCHEDULE 3

                                 QUALIFICATIONS

This opinion is given subject to the following qualifications:

1. The term "ENFORCEABLE" and its cognates as used in this opinion means that
the obligations assumed by the Company and the Partnership under the
Underwriting Agreement are of a type that the courts of the Cayman Islands
enforce. This does not mean that those obligations will necessarily be enforced
in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular:

         (a)      enforcement of obligations and the priority of obligations may
                  be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation,
                  reorganisation, readjustment of debts or moratorium and other
                  laws of general application relating to or affecting the
                  rights of creditors or by prescription or lapse of time;

         (b)      enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity and
                  in particular the availability of certain equitable remedies
                  such as injunction or specific performance of an obligation
                  may be limited where the court considers damages to be an
                  adequate remedy;

         (c)      claims may become barred under statutes of limitation or may
                  be or become subject to defences of set-off, counterclaim,
                  estoppel and similar defences;

         (d)      where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction
                  outside the Cayman Islands, they may not be enforceable in the
                  Cayman Islands to the extent that performance would be illegal
                  under the laws of, or contrary to the public policy of, that
                  jurisdiction;

         (e)      a judgment of a court of the Cayman Islands may be required to
                  be made in Cayman Islands dollars;

         (f)      to the extent that any provision of the Underwriting Agreement
                  is adjudicated to be penal in nature (including, without
                  limitation, any provision for the forfeiture or transfer of
                  all or any part of a limited partner's partnership interest
                  following such limited partner's default) it will not be
                  enforceable in the courts of the Cayman Islands; in
                  particular, the enforceability of any provision of the
                  Underwriting Agreement which imposes additional obligations in
                  the event of any breach or default, or of payment or
                  prepayment being made other than on an agreed date, may be
                  limited to the extent that it is subsequently adjudicated to
                  be penal in nature and not an attempt to make a reasonable
                  pre-estimate of loss;

         (g)      to the extent that the performance of any obligation arising
                  under the Underwriting Agreement would be fraudulent or
                  contrary to public policy, it will not be enforceable in the
                  courts of the Cayman Islands;

         (h)      a Cayman Islands court will not necessarily award costs in
                  litigation in accordance with contractual provisions in this
                  regard; and

         (i)      the effectiveness of terms in the Underwriting Agreement
                  excusing any party from a liability or duty otherwise owed or
                  indemnifying that party from the consequences of incurring
                  such liability or breaching such duty shall be construed in
                  accordance with,
<PAGE>
                  and shall be limited by, applicable law, including generally
                  applicable rules and principles of common law and equity.

2. Cayman Islands stamp duty will be payable if the Underwriting Agreement is
executed in, brought to, or produced before a court of the Cayman Islands. Such
duty would be nominal except in the case of:

         (a) a debenture or a legal or equitable mortgage or charge of immovable
         property:

                  (i)      where the sum secured is CI$300,000 (US$360,000) or
                           less, in which case duty would be 1% of the sum
                           secured; or

                  (ii)     where the sum secured is more than CI$300,000
                           (US$360,000) whether initially or after further
                           advance, in which case duty would be 1.5% of the sum
                           secured; or

         (b) a legal or equitable mortgage or charge of movable property (not
         including a debenture but including a bill of sale) in which case duty
         would be 1.5% of the sum secured;

                  PROVIDED THAT no duty shall be payable where the property is
                  situated outside the Cayman Islands and that in the case of a
                  legal or equitable mortgage or charge granted by an exempted
                  company, an ordinary non-resident company (as defined in the
                  Companies Law (as amended)) or an exempted trust (as defined
                  in the Trusts Law (as amended)) or a body corporate
                  incorporated outside the Cayman Islands of movable property
                  situated in the Cayman Islands or over shares in such exempted
                  company or an ordinary non-resident company, the maximum duty
                  payable shall be CI$500.00 (US$600.00); or

         (c) any note evidencing indebtedness, in which case duty of CI$0.25 per
         CI$100 or part thereof of the face value of each note, subject to a
         maximum of CI$250, is payable, unless, the notes are issued as part of
         a series by an exempted company or by an ordinary non-resident company
         (as defined in the Companies Law (as amended)) or by a body corporate
         incorporated outside the Cayman Islands, in which case a duty of CI$500
         in respect of the instrument creating the notes may be paid and
         thereafter no further stamp duty in respect of such notes is payable.

2. A certificate, determination, calculation or designation of any party to the
Underwriting Agreement as to any matter provided therein might be held by a
Cayman Islands court not to be conclusive, final and binding, notwithstanding
any provision to that effect therein contained, for example, if it could be
shown to have an unreasonable, arbitrary or improper basis or in the event of
manifest error.

3. If any provision of the Underwriting Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid
or unenforceable, severance of such provision from the remaining provisions will
be subject to the discretion of the Cayman Islands courts notwithstanding any
express provisions in this regard.

4. In principle, a person who claims to be entitled pursuant to a contract to
recover the legal fees and expenses incurred in enforcing that contract shall be
entitled to judgment for the amount of legal fees and expenses found due under
the contract and such amount shall not be subject to taxation pursuant to the
applicable rule of court. However, the applicable rule (GCR Order 62, rule 4(3))
has
<PAGE>
been in force only since January 1, 2002 and there remains some uncertainty as
to the way in which it will be applied in practice.

5. A conveyance, mortgage, charge or other security interest granted or made by
a company at a time when that company was unable to pay its debts as they fell
due, and made or granted in favour of a creditor with a dominant intention to
give that creditor a preference over the other creditors of the company, would
be void pursuant to Section 168(1) of the Companies Law (as amended), if within
6 months thereof a petition is presented to the Grand Court of the Cayman
Islands for the winding-up of such company, or a resolution is passed for the
voluntary winding-up of the company.

6. Under the Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989, any disposition of property made
with an intent to defraud (which means an intention by the party disposing of
the property to wilfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) and at an
undervalue, shall be voidable at the instance of the creditor thereby
prejudiced.

7. We express no opinion upon the effectiveness of any clause of the
Underwriting Agreement providing that the terms of such Underwriting Agreement
may only be amended in writing.

8. Notwithstanding any purported date of execution in the Underwriting
Agreement, the rights and obligations therein contained take effect only on the
actual execution and delivery thereof but the Underwriting Agreement may provide
that they have retrospective effect as between the parties thereto alone.

9. The obligations of the Company and the obligations of the Partnership may be
subject to restrictions pursuant to United Nations sanctions ("Sanctions")
extended to the Cayman Islands by the Order of Her Majesty in Council. At this
date, Sanctions currently extend to Iraq, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia,
Rwanda, Afghanistan, the Taliban (an Afghan political faction which calls itself
the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) and The Democratic Republic of the Congo.

10. Persons who are not party to the Underwriting Agreement (other than
beneficiaries under properly constituted trusts or persons acting pursuant to
powers contained in a deed poll) under Cayman Islands law have no direct rights
or obligations under such Underwriting Agreement.

11. A limited partner of the Partnership receiving from the Partnership a
payment representing a return of contribution at any time when the Partnership
is not solvent, shall, in the event of the insolvency of the Partnership within
a period of six months from the date of such payment, be liable to repay the
amount of such payment plus statutory interest.

12. Entry of particulars of a mortgage or charge in the Register of Mortgages
and Charges of the mortgagor or chargor may not of itself give that mortgage or
charge priority in ranking over any mortgage, charge or lien existing prior to
its creation.

13. Any charge in the nature of a floating charge will not take priority in
ranking over any subsequent fixed mortgage or charge or lien which is created
prior to the crystallisation of the floating charge.

14. A mortgage or charge may not rank prior to a subsequent mortgage, charge or
lien in respect of indebtedness incurred after the first mortgagee or chargee
has notice of the subsequent mortgage, charge or lien.
<PAGE>
15. We render no opinion as to the specific enforcement as against the Company
of covenants granted by the Company to do or to omit to do any action or other
matter which is reserved by applicable law, or the Company's constitutional
documents, to the Company's shareholders or any other person.

16. To maintain the Company and the Partnership in good standing under the laws
of the Cayman Islands, annual filing fees must be paid and returns made to (as
appropriate) the Registrar of Companies and the Registrar of Exempted Limited
Partnerships.

17. We express no opinion upon the references to any law or statute not being a
Cayman Islands law or statute in the Partnership Agreement.

         Pursuant to Section 7(g) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants
shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:

                  (i) They are independent registered public accounting firm
         with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of
         the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder
         adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public
         Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB);

                  (ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any
         supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable,
         financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) examined by
         them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
         Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects
         with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange
         Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations
         thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance
         with standards established by the PCAOB for a review of interim
         financial information as described in SAS No. 100, Interim Financial
         Information, on the consolidated interim financial statements, selected
         financial data, pro forma financial information, financial forecasts
         and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial
         statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as
         indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been
         separately furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the
         "Representatives");

                  (iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards
         established by the PCAOB for a review of interim financial information
         as described in SAS No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on the
         unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated
         balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in
         the Prospectus and/or included in the Company's quarterly report on
         Form 10-Q incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as indicated in
         their reports thereon copies of which have been separately furnished to
         the Representatives; and on the basis of specified procedures including
         inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for
         financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited
         condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in paragraph
         (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the
         applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and
         the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their
         attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed
         consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all
         material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the
         Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and
         regulations;

                  (iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect
         to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the
         Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the
         Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the
         Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year
         agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where
         applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for such
         five fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in
         the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;

                  (v) They have compared the information in the Prospectus under
         selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K
         and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing
         came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that
         caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all
         material respects with the disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302,
         402 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;
<PAGE>
                  (vi) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an
         examination in accordance with PCAOB standards, consisting of a reading
         of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to
         below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements
         of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of

         Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries
         responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other
         inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing
         came to their attention that caused them to believe that:

                           (A) (i) the unaudited condensed consolidated
                  statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and
                  consolidated statements of cash flows included in the
                  Prospectus and/or included or incorporated by reference in the
                  Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by
                  reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all
                  material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
                  of the Exchange Act and the related published rules and
                  regulations, or (ii) any material modifications should be made
                  to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income,

                  generally accepted accounting principles;

                           (B) any other unaudited income statement data and
                  balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree
                  with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated
                  financial statements from which such data and items were
                  derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not
                  determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis
                  for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated
                  financial statements included or incorporated by reference in
                  the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent
                  fiscal year;

                           (C) the unaudited financial statements which were not
                  included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the
                  unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause
                  (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet
                  items included in the Prospectus and referred to in clause (B)
                  were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with
                  the basis for the audited financial statements included or
                  incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on
                  Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

                           (D) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed
                  financial statements included or incorporated by reference in
                  the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material
                  respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the
                  Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the
                  pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the
                  historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;

                           (E) as of a specified date not more than five days
                  prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes
                  in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of
                  capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation
                  rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon
                  conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were
                  outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included
                  or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any
                  increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and
                  its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current
                  assets or stockholders' equity or other items specified by the
                  Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by
                  the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts
<PAGE>
                  shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by
                  reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes,
                  increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have
                  occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter;
                  and

                           (F) for the period from the date of the latest
                  financial statements included or incorporated by reference in
                  the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in clause (E)
                  there were any decreases in consolidated net revenues or
                  operating profit or the total or per share amounts of
                  consolidated net income or other items specified by the
                  Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by
                  the Representatives, in each case as compared with the
                  comparable period of the preceding year and with any other
                  period of corresponding length specified by the
                  Representatives, except in each case for increases or
                  decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may
                  occur or which are described in such letter; and

                  (vii) In addition to the examination referred to in their
         report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and
         the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other
         procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (vi) above, they have
         carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an
         examination in accordance with PCAOB standards, with respect to certain
         amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the
         Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records
         of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus
         (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in
         exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the
         Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the
         Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain
         of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the
         accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found
         them to be in agreement.

         Re:  WESCO International, Inc. - Lock-Up Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The undersigned understands that you, as representatives (the
"Representatives"), propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement on behalf of
the several Underwriters named in Schedule I to such agreement (collectively,
the "Underwriters"), with WESCO International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and the Selling Stockholders named therein (the "Underwriting
Agreement"), providing for a public offering of the Common Stock, $.01 par
value, of the Company (the "Shares") pursuant to a Registration Statement on
Form S-3 (No. 333-119909) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC").

         In consideration of the agreement by the Underwriters to offer and sell
the Shares, and of other good and valuable consideration the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees that, during
the period specified in the following paragraph (the "Lock-up Period"), the
undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to
purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock
of the Company, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of Common
Stock of the Company, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
that represent the right to receive shares of Common Stock of the Company,
whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, owned directly by the undersigned
(including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which the undersigned has
beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the SEC (collectively
the "Undersigned's Shares"). The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to
preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which
is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a
sale or disposition of the Undersigned's Shares even if such Shares would be
disposed of by someone other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or
other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or
call option) with respect to any of the Undersigned's Shares or with respect to
any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its
value from such Shares.

         The initial Lock-up Period will commence on the date of this Lock-up
Agreement and continue for 90 days after the public offering date set forth on
the final prospectus used to sell the Shares (the "Public Offering Date")
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement; provided, however, that if (1) during
the last 17 days of the initial Lock-up Period the
<PAGE>
Company releases earnings results or announces material news or a material event
or (2) prior to the expiration of the initial Lock-up Period the Company
announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period
beginning on the last day of the initial Lock-up Period, then in each case the
Lock-up Period will be automatically extended until the expiration of the 18-day
period beginning on the date of release of the earnings results or the
announcement of the material news or material event, as applicable, unless
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. waive in writing, such extension.

         The undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company has
agreed in the Underwriting Agreement to provide written notice of any event that
would result in an extension of the Lock-up Period pursuant to the previous
paragraph to the undersigned and that any such notice properly delivered will be
deemed to have given to, and received by, the undersigned. The undersigned
hereby further agrees that, prior to engaging in any transaction or taking any
other action that is subject to the terms of this Lock-up Agreement during the
period from the date of this Lock-up Agreement to and including the 34th day
following the expiration of the initial Lock-up Period, it will give notice
thereof to the Company and will not consummate such transaction or take any such
action unless it has received written confirmation from the Company that the
Lock-up Period (as may have been extended pursuant to the previous paragraph)
has expired.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may transfer the
Undersigned's Shares (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee
or donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth
herein, (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned
or the immediate family of the undersigned, provided that the trustee of the
trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and
provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for
value, or (iii) with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
Lehman Brothers Inc. on behalf of the Underwriters. For purposes of this Lock-Up
Agreement, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption, not more remote than first cousin. In addition, notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the undersigned is a corporation, the corporation may transfer the
capital stock of the Company to any wholly-owned subsidiary of such corporation;
provided, however, that in any such case, it shall be a condition to the
transfer that the transferee execute an agreement stating that the transferee is
receiving and holding such capital stock subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and there shall be no further transfer of such capital stock except in
accordance with this Agreement, and provided further that any such transfer
shall not involve a disposition for value. The undersigned now has, and, except
as contemplated by clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above, for the duration of this
Lock-Up Agreement will have, good and marketable title to the Undersigned's
Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims whatsoever. The
undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions
with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the
Undersigned's Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.
<PAGE>
         The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters are
relying upon this Lock-Up Agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the
offering. The undersigned further understands that this Lock-Up Agreement is
irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal
representatives, successors, and assigns.

                                  Very truly yours,
