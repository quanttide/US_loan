<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AMERICA WEST FINANCES ITS MAINTENANCE FACILITY AND<BR>
FLIGHT CENTER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHOENIX&#151;America West Airlines (NYSE: AWA), a wholly owned subsidiary of America West
Holdings Corporation, today announced it has entered into an agreement to raise additional capital
by financing its Phoenix maintenance facility and flight training center. The flight training
center was previously unencumbered, and the maintenance facility became unencumbered earlier this
year when the airline refinanced its term loan. Using these two facilities as collateral, the
airline, on Dec. 27, 2004, raised $30.8&nbsp;million through the issuance of a senior secured discount
note. The new note requires principal payments of $1.5&nbsp;million on the first two anniversary dates
with the remaining principal amount due on the fifth anniversary
date. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. acted as a structuring agent in
connection with the financing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of this transaction, America West called for redemption of all of its outstanding
10.75&nbsp;percent senior unsecured notes due Sept. 1, 2005. The redemption date is Jan. 26, 2005. The
senior unsecured notes will be redeemed at par, which will require a payment of $41.3&nbsp;million to
extinguish the debt. The airline irrevocably deposited the $30.8&nbsp;million raised through the
maintenance facility and flight training center financing, together with an additional $10.5
million from its operating cash flow, with the trustee for the senior unsecured notes. America West
has filed additional information about this transaction on Form 8-K with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America West&#146;s Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr stated, &#147;This transaction allows us to
extend debt maturities and create additional liquidity. Although we used cash to prepay existing
debt, the prepaid debt would have matured in the third quarter of 2005 and this transaction
provides approximately $30&nbsp;million in additional liquidity in the fourth quarter 2005. Today&#146;s
announcement provides further evidence that the market continues to support our business plan and
our goal to strengthen our balance sheet.&#148;
