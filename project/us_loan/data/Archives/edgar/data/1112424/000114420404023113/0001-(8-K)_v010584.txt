Form 8-K to report the following:

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS

On December 27, 2004, the Company received a copy of a Summons and Class Action
Complaint For Violations of Federal Securities Laws, that was filed on October
18, 2004,in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California
under case number SACV04-1226 GLT. Bogdan C. Maglich, the Company's Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman, Barry Alter, a former President and Director of
the Company, and Gregory Gilbert, a former Director of the Company were also
named as defendants.

As previously disclosed by the Company, the Complaint as filed seeks an
unspecified amount of damages on behalf of all similarly situated shareholders
and alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws by making
allegedly false and misleading in its public filings. The Company intends to
vigorously defend itself and has engaged counsel to represent it in this matter
and assess the impact of the pending lawsuit. The costs of defending against the
claims could be substantial, however the Company is unable to predict an exact
amount, or even a meaningful estimate, at this time.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Any statements made in this release which are not historical facts contain
certain forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, concerning potential developments affecting the
business, prospects, financial condition and other aspects of the company to
which this release pertains. The actual results of the specific items described
in this release, and the company's operations generally, may differ materially
from what is projected in such forward- looking statements. Although such
statements are based upon the best judgments of management of the company as of
the date of this release, significant deviations in magnitude, timing and other
factors may result from business risks and uncertainties including, without
limitation, the company's dependence on third parties, general market and
economic conditions, technical factors, the availability of outside capital,
receipt of revenues and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of
the company. The company disclaims any obligation to update information
contained in any forward- looking statement.

These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity,
performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievement expressed or implied by such
forward looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward looking
statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "intend,"
"expects," "plan," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts,"
"potential," or "continue" or the negative of such terms or other comparable
terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward
looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of
activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other
person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such
statements. In addition to the risks described above, additional risks affecting
our Company can be found in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
