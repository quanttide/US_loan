The Class B Certificates are cross-collateralized and provide credit support for
all Loan Groups. The outstanding balances of the Class B Certificates could be
reduced to zero as a result of a disproportionate amount of Realized Losses on
the Mortgage Loans in one Loan Group. In addition, under certain circumstances
principal otherwise payable to the Class B Certificates will be paid to the
Class A Certificates. Please see the diagram below. Additional credit
enhancement is provided by the allocation of all principal prepayments to the
Class A Certificates, subject to certain exceptions, for the first seven years
and the disproportionately greater allocation of prepayments to the Class A
Certificates over the following four years. The disproportionate allocation of
prepayments will accelerate the amortization of the Class A Certificates
relative to the amortization of the Subordinate Certificates. As a result, the
credit support percentage for the Class A Certificates should be maintained and
may be increased during the first eleven years.

Description of The Group 1 Mortgage Loans

The Group 1 Mortgage Loans consist of 3/1 One-Year LIBOR Hybrid ARMs secured by
first lien, one-to-four family residential properties. The Mortgage Loans have a
fixed interest rate for the first 3 years after origination and thereafter the
Mortgage Loans have a variable interest rate. Approximately 62.19% of the Group
1 Mortgage Loans require only the payment of interest until the month following
the first rate adjustment date. The mortgage interest rate adjusts at the end of
the initial fixed interest rate period and annually thereafter. The mortgage
interest rates will be indexed to One-Year LIBOR and will adjust to that index
plus a certain number of basis points (the "Gross Margin"). The One-Year LIBOR
index will be equal to the rate quoted as of either (i) the first business day
of the month preceding the adjustment date or (ii) forty-five days prior to the
adjustment date. The One-Year LIBOR Index is the average of the interbank
offered rates for one-year U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London Market
("LIBOR") as published in The Wall Street Journal. The mortgage interest rates
generally have Periodic Caps of 2% for the first adjustment date and for every
adjustment date thereafter. The mortgage interest rates are subject to lifetime
maximum mortgage interest rates, which are generally 6% over the initial
mortgage interest rate. None of the mortgage interest rates are subject to a
lifetime minimum interest rate. Therefore, the effective minimum interest rate
for each Mortgage Loan will be its Gross Margin.

Borrowers are permitted to prepay their Mortgage Loans, in whole or in part, at
any time without penalty.

The approximate collateral statistics for the Group 1 Mortgage Loans are listed
below as of the Cut-Off Date. The balances and percentages may not be exact due

Description of The Group 2 Mortgage Loans

The Group 2 Mortgage Loans consist of 5/1 One-Year LIBOR Hybrid ARMs secured by
first lien, one-to-four family residential properties. The Mortgage Loans have a
fixed interest rate for the first 5 years after origination and thereafter the
Mortgage Loans have a variable interest rate. Approximately 61.29% of the Group
2 Mortgage Loans require only the payment of interest until the month following
the first rate adjustment date. The mortgage interest rate adjusts at the end of
the initial fixed interest rate period and annually thereafter. The mortgage
interest rates will be indexed to One-Year LIBOR and will adjust to that index
plus a certain number of basis points (the "Gross Margin"). The One-Year LIBOR
index will be equal to the rate quoted as of either (i) the first business day
of the month preceding the adjustment date or (ii) forty-five days prior to the
adjustment date. The One-Year LIBOR Index is the average of the interbank
offered rates for one-year U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London Market
("LIBOR") as published in The Wall Street Journal. The mortgage interest rates
generally have Periodic Caps of 5% for the first adjustment date and 2% for
every adjustment date thereafter. The mortgage interest rates are subject to
lifetime maximum mortgage interest rates, which are generally 5% over the
initial mortgage interest rate. None of the mortgage interest rates are subject
to a lifetime minimum interest rate. Therefore, the effective minimum interest
rate for each Mortgage Loan will be its Gross Margin.

Approximately 1.52% of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans have a prepayment fee as of
the date of origination. The prepayment fee is a 2% fee, which applies to any
amount prepaid (encompassing all prepayments, including property sales and
refinances) in excess of 20% in any 12-month period (which begins on the date of
origination or the anniversary of the date of origination) during the first 36
months of the loan term.

Description of The Group 3 Mortgage Loans

The Group 3 Mortgage Loans consist of 7/1 One-Year LIBOR Hybrid ARMs secured by
first lien, one-to-four family residential properties. The Mortgage Loans have a
fixed interest rate for the first 7 years after origination and thereafter the
Mortgage Loans have a variable interest rate. Approximately 46.33% of the Group
3 Mortgage Loans require only the payment of interest until the month following
the first rate adjustment date. The mortgage interest rate adjusts at the end of
the initial fixed interest rate period and annually thereafter. The mortgage
interest rates will be indexed to One-Year LIBOR and will adjust to that index
plus a certain number of basis points (the "Gross Margin"). The One-Year LIBOR
index will be equal to the rate quoted as of either (i) the first business day
of the month preceding the adjustment date or (ii) forty-five days prior to the
adjustment date. The One-Year LIBOR Index is the average of the interbank
offered rates for one-year U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London Market
("LIBOR") as published in The Wall Street Journal. The mortgage interest rates
generally have Periodic Caps of 5% for the first adjustment date and 2% for
every adjustment date thereafter. The mortgage interest rates are subject to
lifetime maximum mortgage interest rates, which are generally 5% over the
initial mortgage interest rate. None of the mortgage interest rates are subject
to a lifetime minimum interest rate. Therefore, the effective minimum interest
rate for each Mortgage Loan will be its Gross Margin.

Borrowers are permitted to prepay their Mortgage Loans, in whole or in part, at
any time without penalty.

                  Collateral Summary of Group 4 Mortgage Loans
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description of The Group 4 Mortgage Loans

The Group 4 Mortgage Loans consist of 10/1 One-Year LIBOR Hybrid ARMs secured by
first lien, one-to-four family residential properties. The Mortgage Loans have a
fixed interest rate for the first 10 years after origination and thereafter the
Mortgage Loans have a variable interest rate. Approximately 61.64% of the Group
4 Mortgage Loans require only the payment of interest until the month following
the first rate adjustment date. The mortgage interest rate adjusts at the end of
the initial fixed interest rate period and annually thereafter. The mortgage
interest rates will be indexed to One-Year LIBOR and will adjust to that index
plus a certain number of basis points (the "Gross Margin"). The One-Year LIBOR
index will be equal to the rate quoted as of either (i) the first business day
of the month preceding the adjustment date or (ii) forty-five days prior to the
adjustment date. The One-Year LIBOR Index is the average of the interbank
offered rates for one-year U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London Market
("LIBOR") as published in The Wall Street Journal. The mortgage interest rates
generally have Periodic Caps of 5% for the first adjustment date and 2% for
every adjustment date thereafter. The mortgage interest rates are subject to
lifetime maximum mortgage interest rates, which are generally 5% over the
initial mortgage interest rate. None of the mortgage interest rates are subject
to a lifetime minimum interest rate. Therefore, the effective minimum interest
rate for each Mortgage Loan will be its Gross Margin.

Borrowers are permitted to prepay their Mortgage Loans, in whole or in part, at
any time without penalty.
