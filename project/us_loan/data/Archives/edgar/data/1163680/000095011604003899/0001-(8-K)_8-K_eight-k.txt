          ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         As disclosed in Item 5.02 below, on December 21, 2004, we appointed
Joseph Safina to our Board of Directors in the capacity of Vice Chairman.
Concurrent with this appointment, we entered into a consulting agreement with
Mr. Safina. The term of the agreement is twelve months, after which it shall
automatically renew for successive one-month periods unless either party
provides written notice at least ten business days prior to the expiration of
the then current period that it wishes to terminate the agreement. As
compensation for services provided pursuant to this agreement, Mr. Safina is
entitled to receive:

               o  On the date of the consulting agreement, warrants to purchase
                  1,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
                  $.49 per share, which was the closing bid price of our common
                  stock as quoted on the Over-the Counter Bulletin Board (the
                  "OTCBB") on December 21, 2004;

               o  On the date on which we complete an equity offering of at
                  least $10,000,000, warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of
                  our common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing bid
                  price of our common stock as quoted on the OTCBB on such date,
                  provided that, Mr. Safina must still be performing all duties
                  required pursuant to the consulting agreement on such date;
                  and

               o  On the first anniversary of the date of the consulting
                  agreement, warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common
                  stock at an exercise price equal to the closing bid price of
                  our common stock as quoted on the OTCBB on such date, provided
                  that, Mr. Safina must still be performing all duties required
                  pursuant to the consulting agreement on such date.

         Pursuant to this agreement, Mr. Safina has agreed to perform the
following duties:

               o  Assist management in designing a strategic operational plan;

               o  Design and implement a strategy to position us in the domestic
                  and international financial markets to complete an offering of
                  our securities;

               o  Assist management in evaluating, financing and negotiating
                  mergers and acquisitions;

               o  Assist management in developing corporate finance, governance
                  and administrative policy; and
