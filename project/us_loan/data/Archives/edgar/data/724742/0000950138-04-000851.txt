SYMS CORP REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER


Secaucus,  New  Jersey,  December  20,  2004 - Syms Corp  (NYSE:SYM),  a leading
off-price  retailer,  announced results for the third quarter ended November 27,
2004.

The Company's net profit for the third quarter ended November 27, 2004 was $0.13
per share ($2.0  million) as compared to $0.07 per share ($1.0  million) for the
same period last year.  The Company had a net loss for the 39-week  period ended
November 27, 2004 of $0.11 per share ($1.7 million) as compared to a net loss of
$0.35 per share ($5.4 million) for the same period last year.

Sales for the third quarter  increased 2.2% to $76.0  million,  an increase from
$74.3 million for the same period last year.  Sales for the 39-week period ended
November 27, 2004 increased 2.8% to $205.6  million,  up from $200.0 million for
the same period last year. Same store sales for the third quarter ended November
27, 2004  increased  5.1% as compared to the same period last year,  and for the
39-week period ended  November 27, 2004,  increased 4.1% as compared to the same
periods last year.

The results for the third quarter were impacted by additional markdowns on goods
sold of  approximately  $2,000,000  in an effort  to clear out aged  merchandise
which was offset by a  reduction  in the  markdown  reserve.  The  Company  also
recorded  a gain of  $738,000  on the  sale of land it owned  in  Roseland,  New
Jersey.

Syms  currently  operates a chain of thirty  seven  "off-price"  apparel  stores
located  throughout  the  Northeastern  and Middle  Atlantic  regions and in the
Midwest,  Southeast and Southwest. Each Syms store offers a broad range of first
quality,  in-season  merchandise  bearing  nationally  recognized  designer  and
brand-name labels.

Certain  information in this press release includes  forward-looking  statements
(as such term is  defined in the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of
1995) and  information  relating to the Company that are based on the beliefs of
the  management of the Company as well as  assumptions  made by and  information
currently  available to the  management of the Company.  When used is this press
release,  the words "anticipate",  "believe",  "estimate",  "expect",  "intend",
"plan",  and  similar  expressions  as  they  relate  to the  Company,  identify
forward-looking  statements.  Such  statements  reflect the current views of the
Company  with  respect  to future  events,  the  outcome  of which is subject to
certain risks,  including among others general  economic and market  conditions,

Company's computer or telephone systems, possible work stoppages, or increase in
labor  costs,  effects of  competition,  possible  disruptions  or delays in the
opening of new stores or  inability  to obtain  suitable  sites for new  stores,
higher than  anticipated  store closings or relocation  costs,  higher  interest
rates,  unanticipated  increases in  merchandise  or  occupancy  costs and other
factors which may be outside the Company's control.  Should one or more of these
risks or  uncertainties  materialize,  or should  underlying  assumptions  prove
incorrect,  actual results or outcomes may vary  materially from those described
herein as anticipated,  believed,  estimated,  expected,  intended,  or planned.
Subsequent  written  and oral  forward-looking  statements  attributable  to the
Company  or  persons  acting on its  behalf  are  expressly  qualified  in their
