PART I

Except for the historical information contained herein, the following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties.  The Company's actual results could differ materially from
those discussed here.  Factors that could cause for contribute to such
differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Wireless Data Solutions (the company) develops and markets digital mobile
data terminals and associated software for vehicle fleet management and
location in the United States, South America, Mexico, and Canada.  The
equipment is designed, assembled, marketed and sold by Distributed Networks,
Inc. (DINET) a wholly owned subsidiary of Wireless Data Solutions

The foundation of the company's vehicle tracking and GPS location system is
its adaptable, intelligent and programmable Mobile Data Terminal called "Data
Mate".  The MDTs are integrated with the customer's existing two-way radios,
or various other wireless medium, providing valuable vehicle status
information and solving a wide variety of vehicle fleet management issues.
The company's intelligent MDTs contain a microprocessor and are very cost
effective and affordable for those companies desiring to lower operating
costs and maximize profitability through more efficient vehicle fleet
accountability.

Data Mate mobile data terminals from Wireless Data Solutions relieves
wireless spectrum congestion shared by voice communications by searching out
an opening in the spectrum and digitally transmitting a digital wireless
message of up to 244 alpha numeric characters in less than a second, thus
allowing dramatic increases in vehicle status and location information to be
sent back to the customer's central office.  The mobile data terminals also
provide stored proof dates and times during operation, silent emergency
alarms, and RS232 connection to mobile printers, credit card swipes and bar
code scanners.

Coupled with the company's mobile data terminals, DINET, Wireless Data
Solutions wholly owned subsidiary, has designed and sold proprietary software
called FleetVantage GOLD which resides on the customer's central office,
Windows based, PC.  The software translates the digital data received from
vehicle fleets and acts as a sophisticated message handling center.
FleetVantage GOLD provides specific mapping detail as the vehicle's location
"real time".  All data sent and received by FleetVantage GOLD is archived in
the PC which can be accessed anytime for documentation purposes.

The company's mission is focused on building a high growth and profitable
public corporation by manufacturing rugged and dependable wireless
communications equipment and software targeting specific niche markets that
have been determined to have high demand and few competitors. Dinet's goal is
to provide state of the art vehicle location and status reporting products
and software that exceeds expectations of our customers; and after the sale
and installation, continue relationships with preeminent support and product
improvements upon which we know the customers can rely.

Wireless Data Solution occupies an office in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and its
wholly owned subsidiary DINET occupies office space in Oceanside, California
the principal location for all design, marketing and distribution of the
company's products and services.  The company's transfer agent is Computer
Share Investor Services, 350 Indiana St. Suite 800, Golden, Colorado.

BUSINESS DISCUSSION

The company's core business segment is the construction industry, but more
specifically the ready mix/concrete delivery industry. The company has,
however, sold products and software into another vertical market "For Hire
Transportation".  Sales to the "For Hire Transportation" market is less than
5% of total revenue for the company.

The company's financial performance in fiscal year 2004 resulted in a drop in
revenue from approximately $832,000 for fiscal 2003 to $697,000 in fiscal
2004 a net decline of $132,000 or approximately 16%, due principally to a
relatively flat construction building trend in the U.S.; an increase in
competitive products, and; the need for DINET to develop a next generation
product addressing the additional needs of the industry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION-PROPOSED COMBINATION OF WDSO & IDA CORPORATION

As of December 10, 2004, an Agreement has been signed by the boards of
Wireless Data Solutions (traded OTC:WDSO), and IDA Corporation, a privately
held company in Fargo North Dakota, to combine companies. The information was
first reported on Form 8K dated December 10, 2004.  The final combination of
the companies is contingent on WDSO shareholder approval and raising a
limited amount of equity funds on or before April 30, 2005.

The Agreement caps joint discussions to make both companies stronger within
the industries they serve, while increasing market share and providing a
competitive advantage in the various fields of producing high technology
products such as: VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) equipment, Digital
Remote Control devices used to control two-way radio base station equipment,
and Fleet Mobile Data Terminal products with GPS and proprietary software
oriented toward fleet vehicle tracking and other fleet related vehicle status
reporting operations. The company's Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) report and
announce vehicle information to a dispatch location or central office using
real-time wireless networks, and subsequently store all vehicle activity
during the course of a workday. Management reports are then available to
maximize the efficiency factor in vehicle operations and productivity,
therefore providing customers with a compelling competitive advantage in the
area served. The final combination of the companies is contingent on WDSO
shareholder approval and raising a limited amount of equity funds on or
before April 30, 2005.

IDA Corp. has a long-standing, twenty-seven year reputation of designing and
building electronic products and equipment for a wide variety of wireless
applications used by federal government, State/Local governments, and
business entities worldwide. The company just recently finished developing
and is selling VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) products globally. IDA
Corporation employs on site design engineering, and contract manufacturing,
and the company has produced many finished goods to such companies as M/A-COM
formally General Electric Radio System products, US Navy, Federal Express,
NASA and Lockheed.  IDA has also developed a Global Tracking Data Center,
which captures information relating to automatic GPS tracking called "TRAKIT",
which utilizes various wireless networks to transport data. The GTDC is also
capable of providing information to various customers' outlets simultaneously
via an Internet Based technology or Local Area Network for complete "hands on"
monitoring of desired collateral equipment using the TRAKIT system. Globally,
IDA Corp. is one of only a few companies providing this service.

The focus of the combined companies would be to strive to meet objectives
through R & D programs directed toward fleet vehicle optimization; further
developing the company's expertise in providing specialized contract
engineering and manufacturing services; building its existing customer base
by providing an efficient and easy to use Global Tracking Data Center, which
tracks and monitors vehicles nationwide; and, making choices to develop new
products and programs designed to build value for its shareholders over the
long term.

Item V

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The company's current assets totaled approximately $142,000 compared to
$117,000 one year ago.  Total current liabilities totaled approximately
$173,000 compared to $181,000 in the prior year.  Cash was down
approximately 15,000 over the previous year.  Accounts receivable were
up at year end because of September sales while inventory was down
slightly reflecting the reduced total sales in 2004. The company fully
realizes that its long-term viability rests on increasing sales
substantially, which need to be accomplished through either the
merger/acquisition strategy, or some type of equity funding.

Revenues declined by approximately $132,000 compared to fiscal year
2003.  2004 profits totaled approximately $13,000 compared to $56,000
loss one year ago.  Vigorous cost cutting was a highly significant
factor in posting a profit in 2004.  The general economic conditions
along with the need for advanced technology were viewed as the major
factors in the sales decline.
