ITEM 4.01 CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.

On December 14, 2004, BDO Seidman, LLP ("BDO") informed the Audit Committee of
iLinc Communications, Inc. (the "Company") of its resignation as the Company's
independent accountants.

Additionally, on December 16, 2004 the Audit Committee has engaged on behalf of
the Company the firm of Epstein Weber & Conover, PLC as its independent
accountants. Epstein Weber & Conover, PLC will audit the consolidated financial
statements for the Company for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005.

The reports of BDO on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, contained no
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified as to audit
scope or accounting principle except that those reports contained an explanatory
paragraph expressing substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern.

In connection with its audits for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and
March 31, 2004, respectively, and through December 14, 2004, there have been no
disagreements between the Company and BDO on any matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure,
which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO would have caused
them to make reference thereto in their report on the Company's audited
consolidated financial statements for such years.

During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and through
December 14, 2004, there have been no reportable events as defined in Regulation
S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v), except that: (i) on August 11, 2004, the Company's
independent auditors orally notified the Company's Audit Committee that they had
identified significant deficiencies regarding the Company's internal controls.
The deficiencies noted were the lack of sufficient management oversight over and
the proper segregation of duties of the accounting department; and, (ii) on
November 12, 2004, the Company's independent registered public accountants
orally notified the Company's Audit Committee that they had identified a
material weakness regarding the Company's internal controls. The material
weakness noted was the lack of sufficient control over the sales order and
revenue recognition process.

Management of the Company has informed the Audit Committee that it has hired
appropriate personnel and made changes in assigned roles and responsibilities to
correct for the noted significant deficiencies, and has informed the Audit
Committee that it is in the process of changing procedures to correct the noted
material weakness. BDO has not updated their understanding of these matters, as
such these matters remain open and unresolved with BDO.

The Company has requested that BDO furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC
stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such
letter, dated December 20, 2004 is filed as an Exhibit to this Form 8-K.

For the two most recent fiscal years of the Company ended March 31, 2003 and
2004 and the subsequent interim period through December 14, 2004, the Company
did not consult Epstein Weber & Conover, PLC regarding the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, type of audit opinion that
might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, or any other
accounting, auditing or reporting matter.

EXHIBIT 16.1


December 20, 2004

Securities and Exchange Commission

Washington, D.C. 20549

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We were previously principal accountants for iLinc Communications, Inc.
("iLinc") and, under the date of May 21, 2004, except for Note 18 as to which
the date was June 21, 2004, we reported on the consolidated financial statements
of iLinc as of and for the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. On December 14,
2004, we resigned as principal accountants. We have read iLinc's statements
included under Item 4 of its Form 8-K dated December 20, 2004, and we agree with
such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with
iLinc's statement that the Board of Directors appointed Epstein, Weber &
Conover, PLC as iLinc's independent registered public accountants effective
immediately, or that during the two most recent fiscal years ended March 31,
2004 and 2003, and the subsequent interim periods prior to BDO Seidman, LLP's
resignation, iLinc did not consult with Epstein, Weber & Conover, PLC regarding
any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of
Regulation S-K.

Very truly yours,

/s/ BDO Seidman, LLP
