<p align="center"><b>SUMMUS SECURES ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND<br>
IMPROVES CAPITAL STRUCTURE</b></p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Company secures financing to fuel revenue growth and position the company for prosperity in
2005</i></b></p>

<p><b>Raleigh, N.C.</b> &mdash; December 23, 2004 &mdash; Summus, Inc. (USA) (OTCBB: SUMU), a leading developer of mobile media
applications that optimize the consumer wireless experience, today announced it has secured $1.425 million in financing.&nbsp;
Additionally, the Company has approved initiatives to improve its capital structure, which will position it to continue its strong
revenue growth as it enters 2005.</p>

<p>The Company has made the following capital improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px">Secured investment of $1.425 million on terms more favorable than its existing senior debt. As a result of this investment, the
Company was able to release and return the $1 million of senior convertible debt that was held in escrow from its May 2004
financing, thus alleviating shareholder concerns of significant dilution resulting from the senior convertible debt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px">Conversion of preferred stock and convertible debt into common stock. Investors holding the Company&rsquo;s Series D convertible
preferred stock and the senior convertible debt from the May 2004 financing have converted their holdings into shares of the
Company&rsquo;s common stock pursuant to their terms, thereby strengthening and simplifying the capital structure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px">Implementation of a reverse stock split. Shareholders representing 50.3% of the Company&rsquo;s common stock have authorized a
reverse stock split in the range of 1-for-5 to 1-for-15. The split will reduce the number of shares to a level more appropriate to
the current size, stage and scope of the Company's business. Further, the Company believes that the post-split price will help
facilitate the process of seeking a listing on a more widely accepted exchange or quotation system. Once the reverse split is
effective, the Board of Directors will set the most attractive ratio in order to strike a balance between the absolute level of the
price with the appropriate number of shares outstanding. Information regarding the split (including the specific ratio) will be
made public prior to it becoming effective.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px">Reincorporation into the State of Delaware from the State of Florida.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For additional details regarding these changes, please refer to the Company&rsquo;s Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC
today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the attractive recurring revenue model that Summus enjoys, along with its strong distribution relationships with
all major domestic wireless carriers, the Company does not have to overcapitalize its balance sheet in order to continue it&rsquo;s
strong revenue growth. As such, the proceeds of the funding will be used to fuel the revenue growth in 2005 and into 2006,&rdquo;
said Gary Ban, Chief Executive Officer of Summus. &ldquo;We have made great progress in growing our business in 2004 over 2003, and
we believe that we have an enormous amount of revenue momentum as we enter 2005.</p>

<p>Mr. Ban continued: &ldquo;We have spent significant resources developing new mass market mobile applications during 2004. This
additional investment will allow us to harvest expansive revenue opportunities through new creative sales and marketing programs,
especially as they relate to the burgeoning mobile imaging segment. With multi-megapixel camera phones rapidly becoming available
today, our suite of photo solutions and photo partnerships sits at the intersection of the two major consumer trends that are
redefining the mobile imaging market: 1) device convergence - ongoing improvements in the camera phone will soon match
consumers&rsquo; expectations for their digital camera; and 2) desire to print photos taken with the mobile device directly to
retail locations to take advantage of higher quality color prints at a lower cost as compared to home printing.&nbsp;</p>
