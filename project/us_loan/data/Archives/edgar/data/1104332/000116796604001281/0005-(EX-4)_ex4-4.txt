        REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of December
20, 2004, by and among Summus, Inc. (USA), a Florida corporation, with
headquarters located at 434 Fayetteville Street, Suite 600, Raleigh, North
Carolina 27601 (the "COMPANY"), and each of the undersigned (together with their
respective affiliates and any assignee or transferee of all of their respective
rights hereunder, the "INITIAL INVESTORS").

        WHEREAS:

        A.      In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement by and
among the parties hereto of even date herewith (the "SECURITIES PURCHASE
AGREEMENT"), the Company has agreed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained therein, to issue and sell to the Initial Investors (i) 12%
senior notes (the "NOTES") that are convertible into shares (the "CONVERSION
SHARES") of the Company's common stock (the "COMMON STOCK"), upon the terms and
subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in such Notes and (ii)
warrants (the "Warrants") to acquire 2,794,118 shares of Common Stock (the
"WARRANT SHARES"), upon the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations
and conditions set forth in the Warrants dated December 20, 2004; and

        B.      To induce the Initial Investors to execute and deliver the
Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to provide certain
registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, or any similar successor statute (collectively, the
"1933 ACT"), and applicable state securities laws;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and each
of the Initial Investors hereby agree as follows:

        1.      DEFINITIONS.

                a.      As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

                        (i)     "INVESTORS" means the Initial Investors and any
transferee or assignee who agrees to become bound by the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9 hereof.

                        (ii)    "REGISTER," "REGISTERED," and "REGISTRATION"
refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a Registration
Statement or Statements in compliance with the 1933 Act and pursuant to Rule 415
under the 1933 Act or any successor rule providing for offering securities on a
continuous basis ("RULE 415"), and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness
of such Registration Statement by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC").



<PAGE>

                        (iii)   "REGISTRABLE SECURITIES" means the Conversion
Shares (including Damages Shares, as defined in the Notes and shares issued in
respect of interest or a redemption under the Notes) and Warrant Shares issued
or issuable and any shares of capital stock issued or issuable as a dividend on
or in exchange for or otherwise with respect to any of the foregoing.

                        (iv)    "REGISTRATION STATEMENT" means a registration
statement of the Company under the 1933 Act.

                b.      Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Securities Purchase
Agreement.

        2.      REGISTRATION.

                a.      MANDATORY REGISTRATION. The Company shall prepare, and,
on or prior to the date which is forty-five (45) days after the date of the
Closing under the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "CLOSING DATE"), file with
the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-2 (or, if Form S-2 is not then
available, on such form of Registration Statement as is then available to effect
a registration of the Registrable Securities, subject to the consent of the
Initial Investors, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) covering the
resale of the Registrable Securities underlying the Notes and Warrants issued or
issuable pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, which Registration
Statement, to the extent allowable under the 1933 Act and the Rules promulgated
thereunder (including Rule 416), shall state that such Registration Statement
also covers such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock as
may become issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants
(i) to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar
transactions or (ii) by reason of changes in the Conversion Price of the Notes
in accordance with the terms thereof or the exercise price of the Warrants in
accordance with the terms thereof. The number of shares of Common Stock
initially included in such Registration Statement shall be no less than two (2)
times the sum of the number of Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares that are
then issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants,
without regard to any limitation on the Investor's ability to convert the Notes
or exercise the Warrants. The Company acknowledges that the number of shares
initially included in the Registration Statement represents a good faith
estimate of the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes
and exercise of the Warrants.

                b.      [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.]

                c.      PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY. The Company shall use its best
efforts to obtain effectiveness of the Registration Statement as soon as
practicable. If (i) the Registration Statement(s) covering the Registrable
Securities required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof
is not declared effective by the SEC before the earlier of (i) two (2) business
days after the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2004, if the SEC has notified the Company that the
Registration Statement will not be reviewed and (ii) March 31, 2005 (the earlier
of which shall be referred to herein as the "EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE") or if,
after the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, sales
cannot be made pursuant to the Registration Statement, or (ii) the Common Stock
is not listed or included for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
(the "OTCBB"),


                                       2
<PAGE>

Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ"), the Nasdaq SmallCap Market ("NASDAQ
SMALLCAP"), the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or the American Stock
Exchange (the "AMEX") after being so listed or included for quotation, then the
Company will make payments to the Investors in such amounts and at such times as
shall be determined pursuant to this Section 2(c) as partial relief for the
damages to the Investors by reason of any such delay in or reduction of their
ability to sell the Registrable Securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive
of any other remedies available at law or in equity). The Company shall pay to
each Investor or holder of Registerable Securities an amount equal to the
principal amount of the Notes purchased by such Investor (whether or not such
Notes are then outstanding) (the "PRINCIPAL AMOUNT") multiplied by one and
one-half hundredths (.015) times the sum of: (i) the number of months (prorated
for partial months) after the end of the Effectiveness Deadline and prior to the
date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, provided,
however, that there shall be excluded from such period any delays which are
solely attributable to changes required by the Investors in the Registration
Statement with respect to information relating to the Investors, including,
without limitation, changes to the plan of distribution, or to the failure of
the Investors to conduct their review of the Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 3(h) below in a reasonably prompt manner; (ii) the number of months
(prorated for partial months) that sales cannot be made pursuant to the
Registration Statement after the Registration Statement has been declared
effective (including, without limitation, when sales cannot be made by reason of
the Company's failure to properly supplement or amend the prospectus included
therein in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but excluding Allowed
Delays (as defined in Section 3(f)); (iii) the number of months (prorated for
partial months) that the Common Stock is not listed or included for quotation on
the OTCBB, Nasdaq, Nasdaq SmallCap, NYSE or AMEX or that trading thereon is
halted after the Registration Statement has been declared effective; and (iv)
the number of months, pro rated for partial months, the Company is in violation
of any of the time periods specified in Section 3(c). (For example, if the
Registration Statement becomes effective one (1) month after the end of the
Effective Deadline, the Company would pay $15,000 for each $1,000,000 of
Principal Amount. If thereafter, sales could not be made pursuant to the
Registration Statement for an additional period of one (1) month, the Company
would pay an additional $15,000 for each $1,000,000 of Principal Amount.) Such
amounts shall be paid in cash or, to the extent the Notes are convertible in
accordance with their terms, at each Investor's option, may be added to the
principal amount of the Notes and thereafter be convertible into Common Stock at
the "CONVERSION PRICE" (as defined in the Notes) in accordance with the terms of
the Notes. Any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of such amounts
shall be Registrable Securities. If the Investor desires to convert the amounts
due hereunder into Registrable Securities, it shall so notify the Company in
writing within two (2) business days of the date on which such amounts are first
payable in cash and such amounts shall be so convertible (pursuant to the
mechanics set forth under Article I of the Notes), beginning on the last day
upon which the cash amount would otherwise be due in accordance with the
following sentence. Payments of cash pursuant hereto shall be made within five
(5) days after the end of each period that gives rise to such obligation,
provided that, if any such period extends for more than forty-five (45) days,
interim payments shall be made for each such thirty (30) day period.

                d.      PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATIONS. Subject to the last sentence
of this Section 2(d), if at any time prior to the expiration of the Registration
Period (as hereinafter defined) the Company shall file with the SEC a
Registration Statement relating to an offering for its own account or the
account of others under the 1933 Act of any of its equity securities (other than
on



                                       3
<PAGE>

Form S-4 or Form S-8 or their then equivalents relating to equity securities
to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business
or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee
benefit plans), the Company shall send to each Investor who is entitled to
registration rights under this Section 2(d) written notice of such determination
and, if within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of such notice, such
Investor shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such
Registration Statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities such
Investor requests to be registered, except that if, in connection with any
underwritten public offering for the account of the Company the managing
underwriter(s) thereof shall impose a limitation on the number of shares of
Common Stock which may be included in the Registration Statement because, in
such underwriter(s)' judgment, marketing or other factors dictate such
limitation is necessary to facilitate public distribution, then the Company
shall be obligated to include in such Registration Statement only such limited
portion of the Registrable Securities with respect to which such Investor has
requested inclusion hereunder as the underwriter shall permit. Any exclusion of
Registrable Securities shall be made pro rata among the Investors seeking to
include Registrable Securities in proportion to the number of Registrable
Securities sought to be included by such Investors; provided, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall not exclude any Registrable Securities unless the Company has
first excluded all outstanding securities, the holders of which are not entitled
to inclusion of such securities in such Registration Statement or are not
entitled to pro rata inclusion with the Registrable Securities; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that, after giving effect to the immediately preceding
proviso, any exclusion of Registrable Securities shall be made pro rata with
holders of other securities having the right to include such securities in the
Registration Statement other than holders of securities entitled to inclusion of
their securities in such Registration Statement by reason of demand registration
rights. No right to registration of Registrable Securities under this Section
2(d) shall be construed to limit any registration required under Section 2(a)
hereof. If an offering in connection with which an Investor is entitled to
registration under this Section 2(d) is an underwritten offering, then each
Investor whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration
Statement shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, offer and sell such
Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering using the same underwriter or
underwriters and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the same terms
and conditions as other shares of Common Stock included in such underwritten
offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
registration rights of the Investors pursuant to this Section 2(d) shall only be
available in the event the Company fails to timely file, obtain effectiveness or
maintain effectiveness of the Registration Statement to be filed pursuant to
Section 2(a) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                e.      ELIGIBILITY FOR FORM S-3, S-2 OR S-1; CONVERSION TO FORM
S-3. The Company represents and warrants that it meets the requirements for the
use of Form S-3, S-2 or S-1 for registration of the sale by the Initial
Investors and any other Investors of the Registrable Securities. The Company
agrees to file all reports required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in a
timely manner so as to remain eligible or become eligible, as the case may be,
and thereafter to maintain its eligibility, for the use of Form S-3. If the
Company is not currently eligible to use Form S-3, not later than ten (10)
business days after the Company first meets the registration eligibility and
transaction requirements for the use of Form S-3 (or any successor form) for
registration of the offer and sale by the Initial Investors and any other
Investors of Registrable Securities, the Company shall file a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (or such successor form) with respect to the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement



                                       4
<PAGE>

on Form S-2 or Form S-1, whichever is applicable, filed pursuant to Section 2(a)
(and include in such Registration Statement on Form S-3 the information required
by Rule 429 under the 1933 Act) or convert the Registration Statement on Form
S-2 or Form S-1, whichever is applicable, filed pursuant to Section 2(a) to a
Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 429 under the 1933 Act and cause such Registration
Statement (or such amendment) to be declared effective no later than forty-five
(45) days after filing. In the event of a breach by the Company of the
provisions of this Section 2(e), the Company will be required to make payments
pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof.

        3.      OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

         In connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities, the
Company shall have the following obligations:

                a.      The Company shall prepare promptly, and file with the
SEC not later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, a Registration
Statement with respect to the number of Registrable Securities provided in
Section 2(a), and thereafter use its best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement relating to Registrable Securities to become effective as soon as
possible after such filing but in no event after the Effectiveness Deadline, and
keep the Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times
until such date as is the earlier of (i) the date on which all of the
Registrable Securities have been sold and (ii) the date on which the Registrable
Securities (in the opinion of counsel to the Initial Investors) may be
immediately sold without restriction (including without limitation as to volume
by each holder thereof) without registration under the 1933 Act (the
"REGISTRATION PERIOD"), which Registration Statement (including any amendments
or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

                b.      The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the
Registration Statements and the prospectus used in connection with the
Registration Statements as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statements
effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period,
comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of
all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by the Registration Statements
until such time as all of such Registrable Securities have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers
thereof as set forth in the Registration Statements. In the event that on any
Trading Day (as defined in the Notes) (the "REGISTRATION TRIGGER DATE") the
number of shares available under a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
Agreement is insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities issued or
issuable upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to the Notes, without giving
effect to any limitations on the Investors' ability to convert the Notes, the
Company shall amend the Registration Statement, or file a new Registration
Statement (on the short form available therefore, if applicable), or both, so as
to cover all of the Registrable Securities so issued or issuable (without giving
effect to any limitations on conversion contained in the Notes) as of the
Registration Trigger Date, in each case, as soon as practicable,



                                       5
<PAGE>

but in any event within twenty (20) business days after the necessity therefor
arises (based on the market price of the Common Stock and other relevant factors
on which the Company reasonably elects to rely). The Company shall use its best
efforts to cause such amendment and/or new Registration Statement to become
effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof, but in any event
within sixty (60) days of the Registration Trigger Date. The provisions of
Section 2(c) above shall be applicable with respect to the Company's obligations
under this Section 3(b).

                c.      The Company shall furnish to each Investor whose
Registrable Securities are included in the Registration Statement and its legal
counsel (i) promptly (but no later than one (1) Trading Day) after the same is
prepared and publicly distributed, filed with the SEC, or received by the
Company, one copy of the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, each
preliminary prospectus and prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto,
and, in the case of the Registration Statement referred to in Section 2(a), each
letter written by or on behalf of the Company to the SEC or the staff of the
SEC, and each item of correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC, in
each case relating to such Registration Statement (other than any portion of any
thereof which contains information for which the Company has sought confidential
treatment), and (ii) within one (1) Trading Day after filing, such number of
copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, and all amendments
and supplements thereto and such other documents as such Investor may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such Investor. The Company will immediately notify each Investor by
facsimile of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment. The Company will promptly respond to any and all
comments received from the SEC, with a view towards causing any Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto to be declared effective by the SEC as soon
as practicable and shall promptly file an acceleration request as soon as
practicable (but no later than two (2) Trading Days) following the resolution or
clearance of all SEC comments or, if applicable, following notification by the
SEC that the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto will not be subject
to review.

                d.      The Company shall use reasonable efforts to (i) register
and qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement
under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the
United States as the Investors who hold a majority in interest of the
Registrable Securities being offered reasonably request, (ii) prepare and file
in those jurisdictions such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and
supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to
maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (iii) take
such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and
qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (iv)
take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the
Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition
thereto to (a) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), (b) subject itself
to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, (c) file a general consent to
service of process in any such jurisdiction, (d) provide any undertakings that
cause the Company undue expense or burden, or (e) make any change in its charter
or bylaws, which in each case the Board of Directors of the Company determines
to be contrary to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

                e.      In the event Investors who hold a majority-in-interest
of the Registrable Securities being offered in the offering (with the approval
of a majority-in-interest of the Initial Investors) select underwriters for the
offering, the Company shall enter into and perform its obligations under an
underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, including, without



                                       6
<PAGE>

limitation, customary indemnification and contribution obligations, with the
underwriters of such offering.

                f.      As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such
event, the Company shall notify each Investor of the happening of any event, of
which the Company has knowledge, as a result of which the prospectus included in
the Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and use its best
efforts promptly to prepare a supplement or amendment to the Registration
Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver such number
of copies of such supplement or amendment to each Investor as such Investor may
reasonably request; provided that, for not more than ten (10) consecutive
trading days (or a total of not more than twenty (20) trading days in any twelve
(12) month period), the Company may delay the disclosure of material non-public
information concerning the Company (as well as prospectus or Registration
Statement updating) the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good
faith opinion of the Company, in the best interests of the Company (an "ALLOWED
DELAY"); provided, further, that the Company shall promptly (i) notify the
Investors in writing of the existence of (but in no event, without the prior
written consent of an Investor, shall the Company disclose to such Investor any
of the facts or circumstances regarding) material non-public information giving
rise to an Allowed Delay and (ii) advise the Investors in writing to cease all
sales under such Registration Statement until the end of the Allowed Delay. Upon
expiration of the Allowed Delay, the Company shall again be bound by the first
sentence of this Section 3(f) with respect to the information giving rise
thereto.

                g.      The Company shall use its best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a
Registration Statement, and, if such an order is issued, to obtain the
withdrawal of such order at the earliest possible moment and to notify each
Investor who holds Registrable Securities being sold (or, in the event of an
underwritten offering, the managing underwriters) of the issuance of such order
and the resolution thereof.

                h.      The Company shall permit a single firm of counsel
designated by the Initial Investors to review the Registration Statement and all
amendments and supplements thereto (as well as all requests for acceleration or
effectiveness thereof) a reasonable period of time prior to their filing with
the SEC, and not file any document in a form to which such counsel reasonably
objects and will not request acceleration of the Registration Statement without
prior notice to such counsel. The sections of the Registration Statement
covering information with respect to the Investors, the Investor's beneficial
ownership of securities of the Company or the Investors intended method of
disposition of Registrable Securities shall conform to the information provided
to the Company by each of the Investors.

                i.      The Company shall make generally available to its
security holders as soon as practical, but not later than ninety (90) days after
the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form
complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act) covering a
twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's
fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement.

                j.      At the request of any Investor, the Company shall
furnish, on the date that Registrable Securities are delivered to an
underwriter, if any, for sale in connection with the



                                       7
<PAGE>

Registration Statement or, if such securities are not being sold by an
underwriter, on the date of effectiveness thereof (i) an opinion, dated as of
such date, from counsel representing the Company for purposes of such
Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as is customarily given in
an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and the
Investors and (ii) a letter, dated such date, from the Company's independent
certified public accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by
independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten
public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and the Investors.

                k.      The Company shall make available for inspection by (i)
any Investor, (ii) any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to
the Registration Statement, (iii) one firm of attorneys and one firm of
accountants or other agents retained by the Initial Investors, (iv) one firm of
attorneys and one firm of accountants or other agents retained by all other
Investors, and (v) one firm of attorneys retained by all such underwriters
(collectively, the "INSPECTORS") all pertinent financial and other records, and
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the
"RECORDS"), as shall be reasonably deemed necessary by each Inspector to enable
each Inspector to exercise its due diligence responsibility, and cause the
Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information which any
Inspector may reasonably request for purposes of such due diligence; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that each Inspector shall hold in confidence and shall not make any
disclosure (except to an Investor) of any Record or other information which the
Company determines in good faith to be confidential, and of which determination
the Inspectors are so notified, unless (a) the disclosure of such Records is
necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration
Statement, (b) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or
other order from a court or government body of competent jurisdiction, or (c)
the information in such Records has been made generally available to the public
other than by disclosure in violation of this or any other agreement. The
Company shall not be required to disclose any confidential information in such
Records to any Inspector until and unless such Inspector shall have entered into
confidentiality agreements (in form and substance satisfactory to the Company)
with the Company with respect thereto, substantially in the form of this Section
3(k). Each Investor agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such
Records is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent
jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow
the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent
disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, the Records deemed
confidential. Nothing herein (or in any other confidentiality agreement between
the Company and any Investor) shall be deemed to limit the Investor's ability to
sell Registrable Securities in a manner which is otherwise consistent with
applicable laws and regulations.

                l.      The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any
disclosure of information concerning an Investor provided to the Company unless
(i) disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with federal or state
securities laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement, (iii) the
release of such information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order
from a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction,



                                       8
<PAGE>

or (iv) such information has been made generally available to the public other
than by disclosure in violation of this or any other agreement. The Company
agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such information
concerning an Investor is sought in or by a court or governmental body of
competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to such
Investor prior to making such disclosure, and allow the Investor, at its
expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain
a protective order for, such information.

                m.      The Company shall (i) cause all the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on each national
securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by
the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable
Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (ii) secure
the designation and quotation, of all the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement on the Nasdaq or, if not eligible for the Nasdaq, on the
Nasdaq SmallCap or the OTCBB and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to register with the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") as such with respect
to such Registrable Securities. In the event the Company's Common Stock is
listed on a national securities exchange, the Company shall deliver to such
exchange copies of the prospectus and any supplements or amendments thereto in
accordance with Rule 153 under the 1933 Act such that Investors will have no
further obligation to deliver a prospectus in connection with sales on such
exchange.

                n.      The Company shall provide a transfer agent and
registrar, which may be a single entity, for the Registrable Securities not
later than the effective date of the Registration Statement.

                o.      The Company shall cooperate with the Investors who hold
Registrable Securities being offered and the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing Registrable
Securities to be offered pursuant to the Registration Statement and enable such
certificates to be in such denominations or amounts, as the case may be, as the
managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the Investors may reasonably
request and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, or the Investors may request, and, within three (3)
business days after a Registration Statement which includes Registrable
Securities is ordered effective by the SEC, the Company shall deliver, and shall
cause legal counsel selected by the Company to deliver, to the transfer agent
for the Registrable Securities (with copies to the Investors whose Registrable
Securities are included in such Registration Statement) an instruction in the
form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1 and an opinion of such counsel in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT 2.

                p.      At the request of the holders of a majority-in-interest
of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to a
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with the
Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to change the plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement.

                q.      From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall not, and shall not agree to, allow the holders of any securities of the
Company to include any of their securities in any Registration Statement under
Section 2(a) hereof or any amendment or supplement thereto under Section 3(b)
hereof without the consent of the holders of a majority-in-interest of the
Registrable Securities. In addition, the Company shall not offer any securities
for



                                       9
<PAGE>

its own account or the account of others in any Registration Statement under
Section 2(a) hereof or any amendment or supplement thereto under Section 3(b)
hereof without the consent of the holders of a majority-in-interest of the
Registrable Securities.

                r.      The Company shall take all other reasonable actions
necessary to expedite and facilitate disposition by the Investors of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.

        4.      OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTORS.

         In connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities, the
Investors shall have the following obligations:

                a.      It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of
the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to the Registrable Securities of a particular Investor that such Investor shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable
Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable
Securities held by it as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration
of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents in connection
with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. At least three (3)
business days prior to the first anticipated filing date of the Registration
Statement, the Company shall notify each Investor of the information the Company
requires from each such Investor.

                b.      Each Investor, by such Investor's acceptance of the
Registrable Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement hereunder, unless such Investor has notified the Company
in writing of such Investor's election to exclude all of such Investor's
Registrable Securities from the Registration Statement.

                c.      In the event Investors holding a majority-in-interest of
the Registrable Securities being registered (with the approval of the Initial
Investors) determine to engage the services of an underwriter, each Investor
agrees to enter into and perform such Investor's obligations under an
underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, including, without
limitation, customary indemnification and contribution obligations, with the
managing underwriter of such offering and take such other actions as are
reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities, unless such Investor has notified the Company in writing
of such Investor's election to exclude all of such Investor's Registrable
Securities from the Registration Statement.

                d.      Each Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice
from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section
3(f) or 3(g), such Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such Investor's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(f) or 3(g) and, if
so directed by the Company, such Investor shall deliver to the Company (at the
expense of the Company) or destroy (and deliver to the Company a certificate of
destruction) all copies in such Investor's



                                       10
<PAGE>

possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at
the time of receipt of such notice.

                e.      No Investor may participate in any underwritten
registration hereunder unless such Investor (i) agrees to sell such Investor's
Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements in
usual and customary form entered into by the Company, (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements, and (iii) agrees to pay its pro rata share of all
underwriting discounts and commissions and any expenses in excess of those
payable by the Company pursuant to Section 5 below.

        5.      EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION.

        All reasonable expenses, other than underwriting discounts and
commissions, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or
qualifications pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, including, without limitation, all
registration, listing and qualification fees, printers and accounting fees, the
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, and the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one counsel selected by the Initial Investors pursuant to
Section 3(h) hereof, which fees shall be subject to the limitation contained in
Section 4.5 of the Securities Purchase Agreement, shall be borne by the Company.

        6.      INDEMNIFICATION.

        In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration
Statement under this Agreement:

                a.      To the extent permitted by law, the Company will
indemnify, hold harmless and defend (i) each Investor who holds such Registrable
Securities, (ii) the directors, officers, partners, employees, agents and each
person who controls any Investor within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 ACT"), if any, (iii) any
underwriter (as defined in the 1933 Act) for the Investors, and (iv) the
directors, officers, partners, employees and each person who controls any such
underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, if any (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PERSON"), against any joint or several losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (collectively, together with actions, proceedings or
inquiries by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization, whether commenced
or threatened, in respect thereof, "CLAIMS") to which any of them may become
subject insofar as such Claims arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration
Statement or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date
of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended
or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any
material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading; or
(iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the
1934 Act, any other law,



                                       11
<PAGE>

including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or
regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable
Securities (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) being,
collectively, "Violations"). Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section
6(c) with respect to the number of legal counsel, the Company shall reimburse
the Indemnified Person, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and
payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification
agreement contained in this Section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a Claim arising
out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Indemnified Person
or underwriter for such Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with
the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company
pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof; (ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
(iii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit
of any Indemnified Person if the untrue statement or omission of material fact
contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected on a timely basis in the
prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, such corrected prospectus was
timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof, and the
Indemnified Person was promptly advised in writing not to use the incorrect
prospectus prior to the use giving rise to a Violation and such Indemnified
Person, notwithstanding such advice, used it. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable
Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9.

                b.      In connection with any Registration Statement in which
an Investor is participating, each such Investor agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the
same manner set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each
of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, any
underwriter and any other stockholder selling securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement or any of its directors or officers or any person who
controls such stockholder or underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or
the 1934 Act (collectively and together with an Indemnified Person, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), against any Claim to which any of them may become subject,
under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim arises out
of or is based upon any Violation by such Investor, in each case to the extent
(and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Investor
expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement; and subject to
Section 6(c) such Investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses (promptly
as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable) reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) shall not
apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected
without the prior written consent of such Investor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the Investor shall be
liable under this Agreement (including this Section 6(b) and Section 7) for only
that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Investor as a result of
the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless



                                       12
<PAGE>

of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall
survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to
Section 9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(b) with respect to any
preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party
if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the
preliminary prospectus was corrected on a timely basis in the prospectus, as
then amended or supplemented.

                c.      Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or
Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any
action (including any governmental action), such Indemnified Person or
Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any
indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a
written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall
have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so
desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume
control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the
indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the
case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party
shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses to be
paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel
retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding. The indemnifying party shall pay for only one
separate legal counsel for the Indemnified Persons or the Indemnified Parties,
as applicable, and such legal counsel shall be selected by Investors holding a
majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration
Statement to which the Claim relates (with the approval of a
majority-in-interest of the Initial Investors), if the Investors are entitled to
indemnification hereunder, or the Company, if the Company is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, as applicable. The failure to deliver written notice
to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any
such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced in its ability to
defend such action. The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made
by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, as such expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred
and is due and payable.

        7.      CONTRIBUTION.

        To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited
or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum
contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable
under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
(i) no contribution shall be made under circumstances where the maker would not
have been liable for indemnification under the fault standards set forth in
Section 6, (ii) no seller of Registrable Securities guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be
entitled to contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation, and (iii) contribution (together
with any indemnification or other obligations under this Agreement) by



                                       13
<PAGE>

any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net
amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable
Securities.

8.      REPORTS UNDER THE 1934 ACT.

        With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of Rule
144 promulgated under the 1933 Act or any other similar rule or regulation of
the SEC that may at any time permit the investors to sell securities of the
Company to the public without registration ("RULE 144"), the Company agrees to:

                a.      make and keep public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;

                b.      file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so
long as the Company remains subject to such requirements (it being understood
that nothing herein shall limit the Company's obligations under Section 4(c) of
the Securities Purchase Agreement) and the filing of such reports and other
documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

                c.      furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns
Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the
Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the
Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to
permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without
registration.

        9.      ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

        The rights under this Agreement shall be automatically assignable by the
Investors to any transferee of all or any portion of Registrable Securities if:
(i) the Investor agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign
such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within a
reasonable time after such assignment, (ii) the Company is, within a reasonable
time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the
name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (b) the securities with
respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned,
(iii) following such transfer or assignment, the further disposition of such
securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the 1933 Act and
applicable state securities laws, (iv) at or before the time the Company
receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence, the
transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of
the provisions contained herein, and (v) such transfer shall have been made in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Purchase
Agreement.

        10.     AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

        Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance thereof
may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either
retroactively or prospectively), only with written consent of the Company, each
of the Initial Investors (to the extent such Initial Investor still owns
Registrable Securities) and Investors who hold a majority interest of the


                                       14
<PAGE>

Registrable Securities. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this
Section 10 shall be binding upon each Investor and the Company.

        11.     MISCELLANEOUS.

                a.      A person or entity is deemed to be a holder of
Registrable Securities whenever such person or entity owns of record such
Registrable Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions,
notices or elections from two or more persons or entities with respect to the
same Registrable Securities, the Company shall act upon the basis of
instructions, notice or election received from the registered owner of such
Registrable Securities.

                b.      Any notices required or permitted to be given under the
terms hereof shall be sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt
requested) or delivered personally or by courier (including a recognized
overnight delivery service) or by facsimile and shall be effective five days
after being placed in the mail, if mailed by regular U.S. mail, or upon receipt,
if delivered personally or by courier (including a recognized overnight delivery
service) or by facsimile, in each case addressed to a party. The addresses for
such communications shall be:

                           If to the Company:

If to an Investor: to the address set forth immediately below such Investor's
name on Exhibit A to the Securities Purchase Agreement, with a copy to counsel
for such Investor as set forth on Exhibit A to the Securities Purchase
Agreement.

                c.      Failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy
under this Agreement or otherwise, or delay by a party in exercising such right
or remedy, shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

                d.      This Agreement shall be enforced, governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State. In the event
that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under any
applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed


                                       15
<PAGE>

inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed
modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any provision hereof which
may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any other provision hereof. The parties hereto hereby
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Federal Courts located
in Delaware with respect to any dispute arising under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                e.      This Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement
(including all schedules and exhibits thereto) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than
those set forth or referred to herein and therein. This Agreement and the
Securities Purchase Agreement supersede all prior agreements and understandings
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

                f.      Subject to the requirements of Section 9 hereof, this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and
assigns of each of the parties hereto.

                g.      The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

                h.      This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, once executed by a party,
may be delivered to the other party hereto by facsimile transmission of a copy
of this Agreement bearing the signature of the party so delivering this
Agreement.

                i.      Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and
performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver all
such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other
party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the
purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

                j.      Except as otherwise provided herein, all consents and
other determinations to be made by the Investors pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made by Investors holding a majority of the Registrable Securities,
determined as if the all of the Notes then outstanding have been converted into
for Registrable Securities.

                k.      The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules
of strict construction will be applied against any party.

        12.     INDEPENDENT NATURE OF INVESTORS.

                a.      The Company acknowledges that the obligations of the
Investors under this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, the Warrants and any
other document entered into in connection with this Agreement, the Purchase
Agreement, the Warrants and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(the "TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS") are several and not joint, and no Investor shall
be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other


                                       16
<PAGE>

Investor under the Transaction Documents. The decision of each of the Investors
to purchase Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement has been made by each
Investor independently of any other Investor and independently of any
information, materials, statements or opinions as to the business, affairs,
operations, assets, properties, liabilities, results of operations, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company or of the Subsidiaries
which may have made or given by any other Investor or by any agent or employee
of any other Investor and, as between the Investors, no Investor or any of its
agents or employees shall have any liability to any other Investor relating to
or arising from any such information, materials, statements or opinions. The
Company further acknowledges that nothing contained in the Transaction
Documents, and no action taken by the Investors pursuant hereto or thereto,
shall be deemed to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association, a
joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the
Investors are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such
obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Investors shall
be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without
limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other
Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any Investor to be
joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

                b.      The Investors have been represented by their own
respective separate legal counsel in their review and negotiation of the
Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience only, at the
request of the Company, the Investors and their respective counsel have chosen
to communicate with the Company through Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, LLP,
counsel to one of the Investors. Such counsel does not represent any of the
other Investors and each other Investor has retained its own legal counsel in
connection with the negotiation and review of the Transaction Documents. Also
for reasons of administrative convenience only, the Company has elected to
provide the Investors with the Transaction Documents for the convenience of the
Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by the Investors.
The Company acknowledges that such procedure with respect to the Transaction
Documents in no way creates a presumption that the Investors are in any way
acting in concert or as a group with respect to the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the undersigned Initial Investors
have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the date first above
written.

                                            INVESTORS:
