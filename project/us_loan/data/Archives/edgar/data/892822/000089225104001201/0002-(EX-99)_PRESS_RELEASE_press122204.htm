<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>COLUMBIA, Md. &#151; (BUSINESS WIRE)
&#151; Dec. 22, 2004 &#151; William P. Hales, Chairman, CEO and President, of Hemagen
Diagnostics, Inc., (OTCBB:<U>HMGN.OB</U> &#151; <U>News</U>) today announced the
successful completion of its Exchange Offer for $6,090,000 in principal amount of 8%
Senior Subordinated Secured Convertible Notes due in April 2005 (the &#147;Old
Notes&#148;). Those tendering in the exchange offer received 5,079,438 shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock and $4,033,225 of a new series of 8% Senior Secured
Convertible Notes due September 30, 2009 (the &#147;New Notes&#148;). The common stock
issued will be restricted from trading by contract until after September 30, 2005. The
exchange offer expired on Tuesday December 21, 2004, at midnight, New York City time, and
99.6% of the principal amounts of the old notes were tendered for exchange. The Company
has waived the condition that 100% of the Old Notes be tendered. The effective date of the
offering was September 30, 2004. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The New 8% Senior Subordinated
Secured Convertible Notes will pay interest quarterly, and are convertible into the
Company&#146;s common stock after September 30, 2005 at $0.75 per share. The Company may
force the Notes to be converted at any time after September 30, 2005 if the common stock
has traded at or above $1.25 for twenty consecutive days. The Company may prepay the Notes
at any time at the full face value of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In conjunction with the exchange
offering, the Company reported a one-time non-cash charge for debt conversion costs of
$863,253 for fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, which represent the excess of the fair
value of the Notes and common stock issued in the exchange over the net book value of
existing Notes on September 30, 2004. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Hales, commented that, &#147;we are pleased to announce the completion of the
          exchange offer, we recognize and appreciate the cooperation, faith, and trust of
          our Note holders. We believe that this debt restructuring will benefit both the
          shareholders and the Note holders of the company because it reduces our debt
          from approximately $6 million down to approximately $4 million, it reduces our
          cash interest expense by approximately $160,000 per year, and it removes
          uncertainty related to the short-term maturity of the old notes. In addition,
          this restructuring also allows the company to significantly reduce the non-cash
          expenses related to the amortization of discount on debt. The non-cash
          amortization expense related to the discount on debt was $1,680,000, or $0.17
          per share, in fiscal 2004, and $997,000, or $0.10 per share in fiscal 2003. We
          believe that these substantial non-cash losses have affected our business and
          compromised our position in negotiating long-term agreements with customers and
          vendors.&#148; </FONT></P>
