                  Re:      Structured Asset Securities Corporation,
                           Registration Statement on Form S-3

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel for Structured Asset Securities Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offering of the
Company's Structured Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan Trust Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-19 (the "Certificates"). A Registration Statement of
the Company on Form S-3 relating to the Certificates (Commission File No.
333-115858) has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act") and was declared effective on June 21, 2004. As set forth in the
prospectus dated November 19, 2004, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement
dated December 29, 2004 (the "Base Prospectus" and the "Prospectus Supplement,"
respectively), the Certificates will be issued under and pursuant to the
conditions of a trust agreement dated as of December 1, 2004 (the "Trust
Agreement"), by and among the Company, as depositor, Aurora Loan Services Inc.,
as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
trustee (the "Trustee")

         We have examined a form of the Trust Agreement, forms of the
Certificates, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and originals or
copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such
instruments, certificates, records and other documents, and have made such
examination of law, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose
of this opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all
natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of
all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or by facsimile
or other means of electronic transmission, and the authenticity of the originals
of such latter documents. We further assume ongoing compliance with all
Servicing Agreements (as defined in the Trust Agreement) and the accuracy of the
representations made in the transfer agreements relating to the Mortgage Loans.
As to facts relevant to the opinions expressed herein and the other statements
made herein, we have relied, to the extent we have deemed appropriate, upon
certificates and oral or written statements and representations of officers and
other representatives of the Company and others.

         Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


<PAGE>

                  (i) The Trust Agreement has been duly and validly authorized
         by all necessary action on the part of the Company and, when duly
         executed and delivered by the Company, the Trustee, the Master
         Servicer, and any other party thereto, the Trust Agreement will
         constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company,
         enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
         enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer
         and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
         generally and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including concepts of
         commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible
         unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, and with
         respect to the rights of indemnity or contribution, as may be limited
         by public policy considerations.

                  (ii) The issuance and sale of the Certificates have been duly
         authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company
         and, when duly and validly executed and authenticated in accordance
         with the terms of the Trust Agreement and delivered against payment
         therefor pursuant to the underwriting agreement dated April 16, 1996,
         between the Company and Lehman Brothers, and a terms agreement dated
         December 28, 2004, between the Company and Lehman Brothers (such
         underwriting agreement, as supplemented by such terms agreement, the
         "Underwriting Agreement"), the Certificates will be duly and validly
         issued and outstanding, and entitled to the benefits of the Trust
         Agreement.

                  (iii) Under existing law, assuming compliance with all
         provisions of the Trust Agreement, for federal income tax purposes,
         each segregated pool of assets for which the Trust Agreement directs
         that a REMIC election be made will qualify as a "real estate mortgage
         investment conduit" ("REMIC") pursuant to Section 860D of the Internal
         Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); each of the
         Certificates, other than the Class P and Class R Certificates, will
         evidence ownership of "regular interests" in a REMIC within the meaning
         of Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code, and the Class R Certificate will be
         considered to represent the sole class of "residual interest" within
         the meaning of Section 860G(a)(2) of the Code in each REMIC formed
         pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

                  (iv) The statements contained under the caption "Material
         Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Base Prospectus as
         supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, insofar as such statements
         constitute conclusions of law, are true and correct in all material
         respects as set forth therein.

         In rendering the foregoing opinions, we express no opinion as to the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States of
America and the laws of the State of New York.

         We hereby consent to the filing of this letter and to the references to
this firm under the headings "Legal Matters" and "Material Federal Income Tax
Considerations" in the Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, without
implying or admitting that we are "experts"


<PAGE>


within the meaning of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the
Commission issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Base Prospectus or
the Prospectus Supplement.

                                                          Very truly yours,

                                                          /s/ Dechert LLP

                                                          Dechert LLP
