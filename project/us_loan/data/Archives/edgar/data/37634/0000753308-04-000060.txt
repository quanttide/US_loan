AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<BR>
AGREEMENT dated as of _____________, ____, between FPL Group, Inc. (hereinafter called the "Company"), and <U>__________________</U>(hereinafter called the "Participant").</P>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Grant of Performance Award </I>- The Company hereby grants to the Participant a Performance Award (&quot;Award&quot;) which shall confer upon the Participant the rights set forth below to receive <U>_______</U> shares of Common Stock ("Performance Shares").  These Performance Shares shall be credited to the Performance Share Account maintained on behalf of the Participant under the Company's Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Plan").  This Award shall be deemed to have been granted on January 1, ____ and shall have a term ending on December 31, ____ (such period hereinafter referred to as the "Award Term").</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Rights to Payment of Performance Award</I> - Payment of the Performance Award shall be conditioned upon the achievement of annual corporate and business unit indicators established by the Company for the Participant under the FPL Group, Inc. Annual Incentive Plan for each of the three calendar years of the Award Term.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Participant shall have the right to payment of that percentage, which may not exceed 160%, of this Award which is equal to the average of the Participant's percentage achievement under the Annual Incentive Plan for each year encompassed by the Award Term. In addition, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which a Participant may receive in any year from this Award and all other stock-based Awards which are also subject to performance criteria is 125,000 shares.  The Compensation Committee of the Board or such other Board committee designated to administer the Plan (the &quot;Committee&quot;) has the discretion to reduce the 
payout, but not to increase it.  </P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Payment of Award  </I>- Payments made hereunder shall be payable in shares of Common Stock, and the Company shall be authorized to withhold from any distribution of Shares, in order to meet the Company's obligations for the payment of withholding taxes, Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory withholding for taxes (including federal and state income taxes and payroll taxes applicable to the supplemental taxable income relating to such distribution) and any other tax liabilities for which the Company has an obligation relating to such distribution.  For the purpose of this Agreement, the date of determination of Fair Market Value shall be the date as of which the Participant's rights to payments under this Award are determined by the Committee.</P>

<P>Payment of amounts due shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the Committee's determination of the Participant's rights to payments, or at such earlier time as the Committee may determine appropriate.</P>

<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Termination of Employment </I>- In the event the Participant terminates his employment with the Company during the Award Term, his rights to payment of the Award will be determined as follows:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If his termination of employment is due to resignation, discharge, or early retirement at the Participant's request, all rights to payments under this Award shall be forfeited.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If his termination of employment is due to retirement on or after his normal retirement age (as defined under the provisions of the FPL Group Employee Pension Plan), early retirement at the Company's request, or total and permanent disability, he shall be entitled to that number of Performance Shares which is equal to the number of Performance Shares granted under this Agreement, prorated for the period of service during the Award Term, and his rights to payments under Section 2 hereof shall be based solely on the number of full years of service completed during the Award Term.  Payment of Awards shall be made at the time and manner specified in Section 3 hereof.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If a Participant's employment is terminated during the Award Term for any reason other than as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, or if an ambiguity exists as to the interpretation of those paragraphs, the Committee shall have the right to determine whether the Participant's Award shall be forfeited or whether the Participant shall be entitled to a pro rata payment based upon full years of service completed during the Award Term.</P>

<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Adjustments</I> - In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or similar corporate change, then the number and price of Performance Shares then held in the Participant's Performance Share Account and the number of Performance Shares that may be granted under the Plan shall be adjusted proportionately.  No adjustment will be made in connection with the payment by the Company of any cash dividend on its Common Stock or in connection with the issuance by the Company of any warrants, rights, or options to acquire additional shares of Common Stock or of securities convertible into Common Stock.</P>

<P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>No Rights of Stock Ownership</I> - This grant of Performance Shares will not entitle the Participant to any interest in or to any dividend, voting, or other rights normally attributable to Common Stock ownership.</P>

<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Nonassignability</I> - The Participant's rights and interest in the Performance Shares may not be assigned, pledged, or transferred except, in the event of death, to a designated beneficiary or by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.</P>

<P>8.<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect Upon Employment</I> - This Agreement is not to be construed as giving any right to the Participant for continuous employment by the Company or a Subsidiary.  The Company and its Subsidiaries retain the right to terminate an employee at will and with or without cause at any time.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of unrestricted shares until the Restriction Period shall have expired.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will issue the Restricted Stock either (i) in certificated form, subject to a restrictive legend substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent, and will provide for retention of custody of the Restricted Stock during the Restriction Period and/or (ii) in non-certificated form, subject to restrictions and instructions of like effect.</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participant may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock during the Restriction Period.</P>

<P>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&#9;(e)&#9;Any cash dividends declared on the Restricted Stock will be paid to the Participant on the dividend payment date.</P>

<P>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to payment of shares issued under this Agreement shall be conditioned upon achievement of the net income goals established by the Company for the Participant in connection with the Annual Incentive Plan for each of the calendar years of the Restriction Period (the "Net Income Goals").

</DIR>

<P>4.<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of Employment </I>- In the event that the Participant terminates employment during the Restriction Period, his or her rights to delivery of shares under this Award will be determined as follows:</P>
<DIR>

<P>5.<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Taxes</I> - The Participant agrees to notify the Company immediately of any election made with respect to this Restricted Stock Agreement under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

<P>6.<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Designation of Beneficiary</I> - The Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries (which may be an entity other than a natural person) to receive shares in respect of the Restricted Stock, or any portion thereof under Section 4 of this Agreement upon the Participant's death.

Any such designation, change or cancellation must be by written notice filed with the General Counsel and Secretary of the Company and shall not be effective until received by the General Counsel and Secretary of the Company.  If the Participant designates more than one beneficiary, such beneficiaries shall receive an equal number of shares of the Restricted Stock or any portion thereof to be delivered under Section 4 of this Agreement, unless the Participant has designated otherwise, in which case each beneficiary shall receive the number of shares designated by 
the Participant.  If no beneficiary has been named by the Participant, the Participant's beneficiary shall be the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate.</P>

<P>7.<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonassignability</I> - The Participant's rights and interest in the Restricted Stock may not be assigned, pledged, or transferred prior to the expiration of the Restriction Period except, in the event of death, to a designated beneficiary or by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.</P>

<P>8.<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect Upon Employment</I> - This Award is not to be construed as giving any right to the Participant for continuous employment by the Company or a subsidiary.

<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Grant of Option</I>.  In accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of (a) the FPL Group, Inc. Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Plan") and (b) this Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (the "Agreement"), FPL Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), grants to the optionee identified on Schedule 1 attached hereto (the "Optionee") a nonqualified stock option (the "Option") to purchase the number of shares (the "Shares") of its Common Stock, $.01 par value ("Common Stock"), set forth on Schedule 1, at the option exercise price per Share set forth in Schedule 1.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acceptance by Optionee</I>.  The exercise of the Option or any portion thereof is conditioned upon acceptance by the Optionee of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as evidenced by the Optionee's execution of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and the delivery of an executed copy of Schedule 1 to the Company.</P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Vesting of Option</I>.  Subject to the terms and provisions hereof and the Plan, the Option shall vest and the Optionee may exercise the Option in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in Schedule 1.  In the event that the Optionee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated prior to the date on which the Option or any portion thereof becomes vested, the non-vested portion of the Option will be void, and will not become exercisable by the Optionee, except as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement.</P>

<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Expiration of Option</I>.  The Option shall expire on the date set forth in Schedule 1 (the &quot;Expiration Date&quot;), unless terminated earlier as set forth in Section 6 below, and may not be exercised after such date. </P>

<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Conditions to Exercise of Option</I>.  Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6 below, the Optionee may exercise the Option or any portion thereof after it has vested and during his lifetime only while he is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary.</P>
<I>
</I><P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Termination of Employment</I>.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, in the event the Optionee terminates his or her employment with the Company or a Subsidiary after the Option or any portion thereof becomes vested as set forth in Schedule 1, the vested portion of the Option shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) 60 days after such termination of employment, or (ii) the Expiration Date.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In in the event the Optionee terminates his or her employment with the Company or a Subsidiary as a result of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Long Term Disability Plan for Employees of FPL Group, Inc. and Its Affiliates), death, retirement on or after normal retirement age (as defined in the FPL Group Employee Pension Plan), or early retirement at the Company's request, the Optionee shall vest in the portion of the Shares subject to the Option based on the percentage of the employment requirement completed during the vesting period, and such vested portion of the Option shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) one year after such termination of employment, or (ii) the Expiration Date.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Procedure for Exercise</I>.  Subject to the Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by the transmittal of a written notice to the Company at its principal place of business.  Such notice shall specify the number of Shares which the Optionee elects to purchase, shall be signed by the Optionee and shall be accompanied by payment of the exercise price for the Shares which the Optionee elects to purchase.  Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee of the Board or such other Board committee designated to administer the Plan (the &quot;Committee&quot;), before the Option is exercised, such payment may be made in whole or in part (i) by check payable to the Company for the full exercise price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise; (ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee for at least six months and acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is eq
ual to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; or (iii) by authorizing a Company-approved third party to sell the Shares (or a sufficient portion of the Shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire exercise price and any tax withholding from such exercise.  The Company may instruct the broker to deposit the entire sale proceeds into a Company-owned account for further distribution to the Optionee, net of the entire exercise price, any tax withholding resulting from such exercise, and any commissions or other costs to effect the sale. The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate applicable State or Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange on which the Stock is traded. If any applicable law requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares specified in the written notice of exercise, or if an
y action remains to be taken under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, as in effect at the time, to effect due issuance of the Shares, then the Company shall take such action and the day for delivery of such Shares shall be extended for the period necessary to take such action.  No Optionee shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company under any Option unless and until Shares are duly issued upon exercise of the Option.</P>

<P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Non-Transferability of Stock Options</I>.  The Option granted hereunder to the Optionee shall not be transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such Option shall be exercisable, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.</P>

<P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Effect Upon Employment</I>.  This Agreement is not to be construed as giving any right to the Optionee for continuous employment by the Company or a Subsidiary.  The Company and its Subsidiaries retain the right to terminate an employee at will and with or without cause at any time.</P>

FORM OF FPL GROUP, INC.<BR>
AMENDED AND RESTATED LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN<BR>
STOCK OPTION AWARD<BR>
<BR>
NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT<BR>
</P>
</B><P><BR>
<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Grant of Option</I>.  In accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of (a) the FPL Group, Inc. Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Plan") and (b) this Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (the "Agreement"), FPL Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), grants to the optionee identified on Schedule 1 attached hereto (the "Optionee") a nonqualified stock option (the "Option") to purchase the number of shares (the "Shares") of its Common Stock, $.01 par value ("Common Stock"), set forth on Schedule 1, at the option exercise price per Share set forth in Schedule 1.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acceptance by Optionee</I>.  The exercise of the Option or any portion thereof is conditioned upon acceptance by the Optionee of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as evidenced by the Optionee's execution of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and the delivery of an executed copy of Schedule 1 to the Company.</P>

<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Vesting of Option</I>.  Subject to the terms and provisions hereof and the Plan, the Option shall vest and the Optionee may exercise the Option in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in Schedule 1.  In the event that the Optionee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated prior to the date on which the Option or any portion thereof becomes vested, the non-vested portion of the Option will be void, and will not become exercisable by the Optionee, except as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement.</P>

<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Expiration of Option</I>.  The Option shall expire on the date set forth in Schedule 1 (the &quot;Expiration Date&quot;), unless terminated earlier as set forth in Section 6 below, and may not be exercised after such date. </P>

<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Conditions to Exercise of Option</I>.  Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6 below, the Optionee may exercise the Option or any portion thereof after it has vested and during his lifetime only while he is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary.</P>
<I>
</I><P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Termination of Employment</I>.  In the event the Optionee terminates his or her employment with the Company or a Subsidiary as a result of total and permanent disability (as defined in the Long Term Disability Plan for Employees of FPL Group, Inc. and Its Affiliates), death, retirement on or after normal retirement age (as defined in the FPL Group Employee Pension Plan), or early retirement at the Company's request, the Optionee shall vest in the non-vested portion of the Shares subject to the Option based on the percentage of the employment requirement completed during the vesting period.</P>

<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Procedure for Exercise</I>.  Subject to the Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by the transmittal of a written notice to the Company at its principal place of business.  Such notice shall specify the number of Shares which the Optionee elects to purchase, shall be signed by the Optionee and shall be accompanied by payment of the exercise price for the Shares which the Optionee elects to purchase.  Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee of the Board or such other Board committee designated to administer the Plan (the &quot;Committee&quot;), before the Option is exercised, such payment may be made in whole or in part (i) by check payable to the Company for the full exercise price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise; (ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee for at least six months and acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is eq
ual to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; or (iii) by authorizing a Company-approved third party to sell the Shares (or a sufficient portion of the Shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire exercise price and any tax withholding from such exercise.  The Company may instruct the broker to deposit the entire sale proceeds into a Company-owned account for further distribution to the Optionee, net of the entire exercise price, any tax withholding resulting from such exercise, and any commissions or other costs to effect the sale. The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate applicable State or Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange on which the Stock is traded. If any applicable law requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares specified in the written notice of exercise, or if an
y action remains to be taken under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, as in effect at the time, to effect due issuance of the Shares, then the Company shall take such action and the day for delivery of such Shares shall be extended for the period necessary to take such action.  No Optionee shall have any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company under any Option unless and until Shares are duly issued upon exercise of the Option.</P>

<P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Non-Transferability of Stock Options</I>.  The Option granted hereunder to the Optionee shall not be transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such Option shall be exercisable, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.</P>

<P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Effect Upon Employment</I>.  This Agreement is not to be construed as giving any right to the Optionee for continuous employment by the Company or a Subsidiary.  The Company and its Subsidiaries retain the right to terminate an employee at will and with or without cause at any time.</P>

<P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Protective Covenants</I>.<B>  </B>In consideration of the Non-Qualified Stock Option Award granted under this Agreement, the Optionee covenants and agrees as follows: (the "Protective Covenants"):</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;During Optionee's employment with the Company, and for a two-year period following the termination of the Optionee's employment with the Company, Optionee agrees not to compete or attempt to compete for, or act as a broker or otherwise participate in, any projects in which the Company has at any time done any work or undertaken any development efforts. Furthermore, during the Optionee's employment with the Company, Optionee shall not directly or indirectly solicit any of the Company's customers, vendors, contractors, agents, or any other parties with which the Company has an existing or prospective business relationship, for the benefit of Optionee or for the benefit of any third party, nor shall the Optionee accept consideration or negotiate or enter into agreements with such parties for the benefit of Optionee or any third party.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Optionee's employment with the Company and for a two-year period following the termination of the Optionee's employment with the Company, the Optionee shall not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Optionee or for any other business, person or entity, entice, induce or solicit or attempt to entice, induce or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company's employ or to hire or to cause any employee of the Company to become employed for any reason whatsoever.</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionee shall not, at any time in the future and in any way, disparage the Company or its current or former officers, directors, and employees, orally or in writing, or make any statements that may be derogatory or detrimental to the Company's good name or business reputation.</P>

<P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionee acknowledges that the Company would not have an adequate remedy at law for monetary damages if Optionee breaches these Protective Covenants.  Therefore, in addition to all remedies to which the Company may be entitled for a breach or threatened breach of these Protective Covenants, including but not limited to monetary damages, the Company will be entitled to specific enforcement of these Protective Covenants and to injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for a breach or threatened breach.  In addition, upon any breach of these Protective Covenants or any separate Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and the Optionee, this Option and all portions thereof, whether vested or unvested, shall terminate and shall not be exercisable thereafter.</P>

<P>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Section 10, the term "Company" shall include all subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company, including, without limitation, Florida Power &amp; Light Company and FPL Energy, LLC, and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates.</P>

<P>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the terms of these Protective Covenants shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in effect.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Adjustments</I>.  In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or similar corporate change, then the number of Shares granted under this Option shall be adjusted proportionately.  No adjustment will be made in connection with the payment by the Company of any cash dividend on its Common Stock or in connection with the issuance by the Company of any warrants, rights, or options to acquire additional Shares of Common Stock or of securities convertible into Common Stock.</P>

<P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Data Privacy</I>.  By entering into this Agreement, the Optionee:  (i) authorizes the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any agent of the Company or a subsidiary administering the Plan or providing Plan recordkeeping services, to disclose to the Company or any of its subsidiaries such information and data as the Company or any such subsidiary shall request in order to facilitate the grant of the Option, the exercise of the Option, or delivery of Shares upon exercise; (ii) waives any data privacy rights he or she may have with respect to such information; and (iii) authorizes the Company or any of its subsidiaries to store and transmit such information in electronic form.</P>

<P>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Compliance With Applicable Law</I>.  The issuance of the Shares pursuant to the exercise of this Option is subject to compliance with all applicable laws, including without limitation laws governing withholding from employees and nonresident aliens for income tax purposes.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and the federal laws of the United States.</P>

<P>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Incorporation of Plan's Terms</I> - This Agreement is made under and subject to the provisions of the Plan, and all the provisions of the Plan are also provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the provisions of Section 9 of the Plan pertaining to a Change of Control).  If there is a difference or conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern.  All terms used herein are used as defined in the Plan as it may be amended from time to time.  The Company and Committee retain all authority and powers granted by the Plan as it may be amended from time to time not expressly limited by this Agreement.&#9;</P>

<P>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interpretation.</I>  The Committee has the sole and absolute right to interpret the provisions of this Agreement.</P>

<P>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Consent to Amendment of Outstanding Awards.  </I>The Optionee hereby agrees and acknowledges that the provisions of any outstanding Award granted to the Optionee under the Plan prior to May 21, 2004, and the provisions of any related Award Agreement, insofar as such provisions relate to the definitions of &quot;Cause,&quot; &quot;Disability,&quot; and &quot;Fair Market Value,&quot; or relate to a Change of Control, or relate to the ability of the Committee to modify outstanding Awards in connection with corporate transactions or events, shall be deemed amended as of the date of grant of such Award to incorporate the provisions of Section 2, subsections 2.04, 2.11 and 2.14, Section 9 and Section 10 of the Plan as in effect May 21, 2004, and to remove any provisions in conflict therewith</P>

<P>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Miscellaneous</I>.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of all successors of the Company.  This Agreement may not be amended without the express written consent of both parties hereto.</P>

<P>By signing this Agreement, the Optionee accepts and agrees to all of the foregoing terms and provisions and to all the terms and provisions of the Plan incorporated herein by reference and confirms that he has received or has access to a copy of the Plan.</P>

<P>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed as of the Date of Grant set forth in Schedule 1.</P>
