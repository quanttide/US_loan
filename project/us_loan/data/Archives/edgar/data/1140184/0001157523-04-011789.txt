iPayment Acquires Portfolio of Merchant Contracts from First Data

    NASHVILLE, Tenn. & DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 28,
2004--iPayment Inc. (NASDAQ/NM:IPMT) and First Data Corp. (NYSE:FDC)
announced today that iPayment has completed the acquisition of a
portfolio of merchant contracts from First Data's Merchant Services
subsidiary for a sale price of $130 million in cash. The acquisition
will become effective on December 31, 2004. iPayment has expanded its
revolving credit facility from $80 million to $180 million from Bank
of America and JPMorgan Chase Bank to finance the purchase.
    The portfolio has approximately 25,000 small merchant locations
representing approximately $9 billion - $10 billion in annual charge
volume. The transaction strengthens an existing strategic relationship
between iPayment and First Data Merchant Services. The two companies
will work together towards creating a preferred provider program
across iPayment's agent network, which contributes to a growing base
of more than 100,000 customers. It is anticipated that the preferred
provider program will include First Data Gift Card Services, TeleCheck
Services, debit payments and terminal deployment, service and leasing
solutions. iPayment is currently a customer of First Data for
processing and terminal deployment services.
    Greg Daily, chairman and chief executive officer of iPayment,
commented, "We are pleased to announce another successful step in
iPayment's profitable growth strategy. iPayment will obtain a
significant portfolio of small merchant accounts and gain access to a
marketing channel of associations and credit unions that will continue
to generate new merchant accounts not available through our existing
relationships. We remain confident in our ability to execute our
growth strategy in the fragmented small merchant marketplace."
    Scott Betts, president of First Data Enterprise Payments, added
"This sale is consistent with our merchant strategy to maximize our
enterprise sales approach of providing multiple products and services
through the right strategic relationships that are beneficial to our
channels, merchants and shareholders. This expanded arrangement allows
us to continue growing in the merchant business while continuing to
provide our processing service to the merchants in this portfolio."

    iPayment Guidance

    The following statements summarize iPayment's guidance for fiscal
2005, including this portfolio purchase from First Data, as well as
guidance for long-term growth in its revenues and expansion in its
operating margin. For fiscal 2005, iPayment is currently comfortable
with a range for annual revenues of approximately $600 - $630 million,
and an operating margin of approximately 10%. iPayment expects net
interest expense of approximately $7.5 - $8.0 million, an effective
income tax rate of approximately 39%, and diluted weighted average
shares outstanding of approximately 18.5 million, including 662,000
share equivalents from outstanding convertible promissory notes.
iPayment is currently comfortable with a range for earnings per
diluted share for fiscal 2005 of approximately $1.80 - $1.85. These
estimates do not yet include a change from iPayment's current
accounting for stock-based compensation under APB 25 to conform with
the recently issued FASB Statement No. 123R. Beyond 2005, iPayment
targets long-term growth in revenues more in line with the industry
growth rate through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
More specific guidance for fiscal 2006 will be given in the second
half of 2005. iPayment reiterates its target annual range for its
operating margin of 10% to 15% of revenues, with gradual improvement
over time. As in the past, the operating margin may fluctuate on a
quarterly basis, and the percentage may change as a result of
acquisitions with higher or lower operating margins than iPayment's
margins.

    iPayment also announced it will host a conference call to discuss
this release today at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. Participants will have
