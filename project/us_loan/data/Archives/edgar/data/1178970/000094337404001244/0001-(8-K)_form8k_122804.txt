Item 1.01       Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
                -------------------------------------------

     As  discussed  in  more  detail  below,   certain   compensatory  plans  or
arrangements in which executive  officers or directors  participate were amended
or adopted by the Board of Directors of Provident Financial Services,  Inc. (the
"Company").

     Board Fees. On December 23, 2004, the Board of Directors of Company, on the
     ----------
recommendation  of the  Governance/Nominating  Committee of the Board,  approved
certain  changes to the retainer and meeting fees for Board and Board  Committee
participation  by  non-management  directors.  The changes,  which are effective
January 1, 2005, are as follows:

     1)   An annual retainer of $5,000 for the Audit Committee Chairman.
     2)   An annual retainer of $5,000 for the Lead Director.
     3)   An increase in the meeting fee to members of the Audit  Committee from
          $800 to $1,000 per meeting.
     4)   The  elimination  of the  $25,000  annual  retainer  to the  permanent
          members of the  Executive  Committee  of the Board of Directors of The
          Provident Bank.
     5)   A meeting fee of $1,000 to members of the  Executive  Committee of the
          Board of  Directors of the Company,  a new Board  Committee  that will
          meet on an as-needed basis.
     6)   A meeting fee of $800 to members of the Loan Committee of the Board of
          Directors of The Provident Bank.

     2005  Performance-Based  Incentive Plan. On December 23, 2004, the Board of
     ---------------------------------------
Directors of the Company, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of
the  Board,  approved  a  performance-based  incentive  plan for the  payment of
incentive  compensation  to senior  officers,  based on the Company's  financial
performance  in 2005. The incentive  payments will be payable in 2006,  based on
the Company's 2005 financial performance compared with 2005 targets relating to:
(i) earnings per share (weighted 50%); (ii) efficiency ratio (weighted 25%); and
(iii) return on average  assets  (weighted  25%)  (collectively  the  "Corporate
Targets").  For a majority of the senior officers who will participate,  payment
of incentive  compensation  to each officer will also be based on the  officer's
performance against his or her 2005 objectives.

     Incentive payments based on the Company's 2005 financial performance may be
made if the Company's  2005  financial  performance  meets or exceeds 95% of the
Corporate Targets ("Threshold").  Incentive payments will be a percentage of the
senior officer's base salary, which percentage will increase based on the extent
to which the Company's financial  performance exceeds the Threshold.  Using 2004
base  salary  levels  and the  current  number of  senior  officers  that  could
participate  (20  persons),  the aggregate  incentive  payments that may be made
would range from  approximately  $816,000 at the Threshold level up to a maximum
of approximately $2.4 million.  Payments will be made in cash and in the form of
restricted stock awards on a 75%/25% or 90%/10% basis, depending on the level of
the senior officer.

     The Provident Bank 2005 Board of Directors  Voluntary Fee Deferral Plan. On
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
December 23, 2004,  the Board of  Directors of The  Provident  Bank (the "Bank")
approved  the  adoption  of a new  deferred  compensation  plan for the Board of

<PAGE>

Directors  of the Bank,  known as The  Provident  Bank 2005  Board of  Directors
Voluntary  Fee  Deferral  Plan (the  "Plan"),  and froze the  existing  deferred
compensation  plan for the Board of  Directors  of the Bank as of  December  31,
2004, in order to satisfy the  requirements of new Internal Revenue Code Section
409A created by the American  Jobs  Creation  Act,  which was signed into law on
October 22, 2004.  No additional  contributions  and/or  deferrals  will be made
under the frozen plan. New Internal Revenue Code Section 409A changes the income
tax treatment of nonqualified  deferred  compensation plans and imposes a number
of new requirements that such plans must adopt,  both in form and operation,  in
order to defer income for years beginning after December 31, 2004. The Plan will
be governed by new Section 409A. Furthermore,  accrued benefits under the frozen
plan will  continue to be governed by the terms of the frozen plan under the tax
laws in effect prior to the enactment of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

     The Plan is a non-qualified plan that allows for the deferral of board fees
by non-employee  directors who elect to defer fees.  Non-employee  directors may
elect to defer the  receipt of 25%,  50%,  75% or 100% of board fees to a future
year as determined by that director,  so long as the  distribution  of such fees
does not begin beyond the year of the director's  normal retirement date. Normal
Retirement  is  defined  under  the Plan as the date of the  Board of  Directors
Annual  Meeting  after the director  attained his or her  seventy-second  (72nd)
birthday.  Deferred fees are credited to an account  established for the benefit
of each  participant,  with interest  credited at the  prevailing  prime rate. A
participating  director  may  receive  the  deferred  payments  pursuant  to the
director's  election in a lump sum or over a  three-year  period,  except in the
event of a change in control (as defined in the Plan),  death or disability  (as
defined in the Plan) or upon a  Separation  from Service (as defined in Internal
Revenue Code Section 409A) prior to attaining age 65 under which circumstances a
lump sum  payment  shall be made.  In the  event  of a change  in  control,  the
undistributed  balance of a participant's  account will be distributed within 60
days of the  change  in  control.  Under no  circumstances  may a  participating
director accelerate the distribution of amounts in his or her account.

     The Provident Bank  Non-Qualified  Supplemental  Employee  Stock  Ownership
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan.  On December  23, 2004,  the Board of  Directors of the Bank  approved the
- ----
adoption of a new deferred  compensation  plan for the executive  management and
key  employees  of  the  Bank,   known  as  The  Provident  Bank   Non-Qualified
Supplemental  Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the  "Supplemental  ESOP"). A prior
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Bank froze the  predecessor  plan as
to new  contributions  and/or deferrals earned following  December 31, 2003. The
Supplemental  ESOP was  adopted  in order to  satisfy  the  requirements  of new
Internal  Revenue Code Section 409A created by the American  Jobs  Creation Act,
which was signed into law on October 22, 2004.

     The  Supplemental  ESOP is a  non-qualified  plan that provides  additional
benefits  to  certain  participants  whose  benefits  under The  Provident  Bank
Employee Stock Ownership Plan are limited by tax law  limitations  applicable to
tax-qualified  plans.  Participation  in the  Supplemental  ESOP is limited to a
select  group  of  executive  management  or  highly  compensated  employees  as
designated  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Supplemental  ESOP  requires  a
contribution  by the Bank  for each  participant  who also  participates  in The
Provident  Bank Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan equal to the amount which would
have been  contributed  under the terms of The  Provident  Bank  Employee  Stock
Ownership  Plan  but for  the tax law  limitations,  less  the  amount  actually


<PAGE>


contributed under The Provident Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan. This benefit
is  payable  in  cash  in  a  lump  sum  upon  the  death  of a  participant,  a
participant's  separation from service or disability (as those terms are defined
in the  Supplemental  ESOP),  or a change in control (as that term is defined in
the Supplemental ESOP) of the Bank or the Company.

     Employment/Change  in  Control  Agreements.  The  anniversary  date  of the
     ------------------------------------------
employment agreement between the Company and Christopher Martin has been changed
from July 14 to January 15 of each year. The  anniversary  date of the change in
control  agreement between the Company and Thomas M. Lyons also has been changed
from July 14 to January 15 of each year.  These  agreements were entered into in
connection with the Company's acquisition of First Sentinel Bancorp, Inc., which
acquisition  was  consummated  on July 14,  2004.  With the revised  anniversary
dates,  these agreements are in the form of agreement as previously filed by the
Company.
