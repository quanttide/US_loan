Item 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

      On December 22, 2004, Parlex Corporation and certain of its
subsidiaries (collectively, "Parlex") entered into a Joint Venture
Agreement, Stock Transfer Agreement and License Agreement (collectively, the
"Agreements") with Infineon Technologies Asia Pacific Pte Ltd ("Infineon"),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infineon Technologies AG.  Pursuant to the
Agreements, Infineon will purchase, for an aggregate $3,000,000, a 49%
interest in a new entity to be formed by Parlex under the laws of Hong Kong
("HoldCo").  HoldCo, in turn, shall own a new entity ("NewCo") to be formed
under the laws of the People's Republic of China ("PRC").  At or before
closing, Parlex shall transfer to NewCo all of the assets relating to its
production of substrates for Infineon, the world's largest producer of so-
called "smart cards".  Under the terms of the Agreements, Parlex is required
to obtain certain governmental approvals from the PRC with respect to NewCo,
and be able to consummate the transaction no later than March 31, 2005 (the
"Outside Closing Date").

      Upon execution of the Agreements, Parlex received a deposit of an
aggregate $1,000,000 of the total purchase price.  Specifically, Infineon
paid $500,000 to Parlex as consideration for the License Agreement, pursuant
to which Parlex granted Infineon a license relating to certain proprietary
technology used in connection with the production of the substrates.  Under
the Agreements, Infineon is required to assign the license to NewCo at
closing, so long as the transaction closes on or before the Outside Closing
Date.  Infineon also paid $500,000 of the $2,500,000 to be payable to Parlex
under the Stock Transfer Agreement, with the remaining $2,000,000 to be paid
at closing.  In the event the transaction is not consummated on or before
the Outside Closing Date, Parlex is required to repay the $1,000,000, or
Infineon shall be entitled to offset such amount against Parlex's substrate-
related invoices submitted to Infineon.

      Infineon and Parlex each have a right of pre-emption in the event
either entity attempts to sell its interest in HoldCo.  In addition, each of
Parlex and Infineon has specific rights to purchase some or all of the other
entity's interest in HoldCo, or sell its interest in Holdco to the other
entity, upon the occurrence of certain events.  Specifically:

      1.    Infineon has the right to purchase all (but not less than all)
of Parlex's interest in HoldCo at any time within three (3) years after the
closing date of the transaction if:

            a.    Parlex fails to meet certain specified performance
                  criteria with regard to yield, delivery, reliability and
                  quality for a period of not more than six (6) consecutive
                  months and after notice is given by Infineon to Parlex
                  specifying the nature and extent of the performance
                  issues;

            b.    Parlex (or any affiliate of Parlex) enters into a
                  definitive agreement to transfer a controlling interest in
                  Parlex (or any affiliate of Parlex) to a company that is
                  then in the business of manufacturing smart cards and or
                  smart cards ICs and is a direct competitor to Infineon, or
                  any Infineon affiliate, and on a list of specified
                  entities;

            c.    a voluntary or involuntary proceeding is commenced with
                  respect to Parlex's debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency
                  or similar law, or the appointment of a trustee or similar
                  official is sought, provided, however, that in the event
                  of an involuntary proceeding, Parlex shall be entitled to
                  a ninety (90) day grace period to dismiss or stay such
                  proceeding; or

            d.    NewCo fails to fulfill an exclusivity clause pursuant to
                  which it shall not sell its products to any other entity
                  on or before December 31, 2005.

      2.    Parlex has the right to purchase a portion of Infineon's
interest in HoldCo such that Parlex's interest shall equal 80.1% of HoldCo's
outstanding shares upon the occurrence of either of the following:

            a.    at Parlex's sole discretion, provided that Parlex may only
                  exercise such option during the time period commencing 12
                  months after the closing date and terminating 24 months
                  after the closing date; or


<PAGE>  2


            b.    upon Infineon's failure to meet certain minimum volume
                  requirements relating to the purchase of NewCo-produced
                  substrates, provided, however, that Parlex may only
                  exercise such option during the time period commencing 24
                  months after the closing date and terminating 36 months
                  after the closing date.

      3.    Infineon may also require Parlex to purchase Infineon's interest
in HoldCo, as follows:

            a.    Infineon has the option to sell, at its sole discretion,
                  either (i) all (and not less than all) of its interest in
                  HoldCo, or (ii) such portion of its interest in HoldCo as
                  will result in Infineon owning 19.9% of HoldCo following
                  such sale; and

            b.    Infineon's option to sell all or a portion of its interest
                  in HoldCo to Parlex shall only be exercisable in the event
                  that Parlex (or any other entity that owns an interest in
                  HoldCo) has entered into an agreement which will cause a
                  "Change of Control".  For this purpose, a "Change of
                  Control" shall be deemed to occur if any person becomes
                  the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the combined voting
                  power of Parlex (or any other entity that owns an interest
                  in HoldCo) (subject to certain exceptions such as the
                  acquisition of shares by an employee benefit plan, etc.).

      4.    The price at which such shares shall be purchased and sold in
the event of any of the above is pre-determined and is based on (i) the
value of HoldCo as established by this transaction, (ii) HoldCo's net
income, and (iii) a premium of five percent (5%).

      In connection with the transaction, Parlex and Infineon shall at
closing also enter into a number of ancillary agreements, including those
relating to the supply of substrates to Infineon and the provision of
certain services by Parlex to NewCo.

      On December 28, 2004, Parlex Corporation issued a press release
summarizing these matters.  A copy of the press release is attached hereto
as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
