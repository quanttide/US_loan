ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.

      On December 22, 2004 Community Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company") entered
into a Pro Tanto Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") with respect to the
shareholder derivative cases styled M. Lewis Benson, et al. v. Community
Bancshares, Inc., et al. and John M. Packard, Jr., et al. v. Sheffield
Electrical Contractors, Inc., et al. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will
recover a total of $625,000 and all of the individual defendants in the lawsuits
(except for Kennon R. Patterson, Sr., Jimmy Childers and Dewey Hamaker) will be
released from liability. On December 22, 2004 the Circuit Court of Blount
County, Alabama entered an Order Setting a Hearing on a Proposed Settlement
Agreement (the "Order"). A hearing on the fairness of the Agreement is scheduled
for 1:00 p.m. on January 31, 2005 at the Blount County Courthouse in Oneonta,
Alabama. The Order provides that any stockholder of the Company wishing to
object to the Agreement must file the objection with the Clerk of Court no later
than the close of business on January 24, 2005 and must serve the objection on
all attorneys of record in the lawsuits. Pursuant to General Instruction F to
Form 8-K, the Agreement and the Order are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and
99.2, respectively, and are incorporated into this Item 8.01 by reference.
Copies of the Agreement and the Order will be mailed to all stockholders of
record.

      On December 21, 2004 the Company and Travelers Casualty & Surety Company
of America ("Travelers") agreed to a settlement of the claim made by the Company
under the fidelity bond issued by Travelers, which claim is the subject of
pending litigation filed by the Company. Pursuant to this settlement, the
Company will receive $450,000 and will release Travelers from any further
liability under the fidelity bond. Travelers will release all claims against
past and present officers and directors of the Company, but will retain
subrogation rights with respect to any restitution order entered in a criminal
or administrative proceeding against Kennon R. Patterson, Sr. or Larry Bishop.
The settlement also provides that in the event the Company obtains a judgment
and recovery in the lawsuit filed by the Company against Mr. Patterson, the
Company will first recover its costs of litigation and collection and then
Travelers will be entitled to the proceeds of such litigation up to the amount
of its payment under the bond.
