           ORDER SETTING A HEARING ON A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

      The Court has been informed that an agreement amongst the principally
affected parties to this litigation, -- viz., Community Bank, Community
Bancshares, Inc., some past and present individually named directors and
officers of those two entities (with the exception of the defendant Kennon R.
Patterson, Sr.), and the derivative plaintiffs (Dr. and Mrs. Benson, Dr.
Packard, and Dr. Mann) -- has been reached. At the request of those parties,
therefore, and upon good cause shown to the Court,

      IT IS ORDERED BY THE COURT AS FOLLOWS:

      1) SUBSTITUTION OF THE NEW AGREEMENT. The Settlement Agreement dated 22nd
December 2004 between and among Community Bank, Community Bancshares, Inc., the
officers and directors of those entities named in the Complaint (other than
Kennon R. Patterson, Sr.), and the derivative plaintiffs (a copy of which
Settlement Agreement is hereto attached) is substituted

for any agreement of settlement previously proposed to the Court for approval
and shall, for all purposes, be considered by the Court as superseding all
former proposed agreements.

      2) DATE AND HOUR FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE NEW AGREEMENT. The Court will
hear objections, if any, to the attached Settlement Agreement and to the
application of counsel for the derivative plaintiffs for an award of fees and
expenses and also will consider the fairness of the agreement to all affected
parties on the 31st day of January, 2005, at 1:00 p.m.

      3) APPLICATION OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES. The payment of attorneys'
fees and expenses to Plaintiffs' counsel will be considered as part of the
overall fairness of the settlement at the scheduled hearing.

      4) NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND OBJECTIONS. Within seven (7) days from the
date of this order, Community Bancshares, Inc., will despatch to all of its
shareholders of record as of this date a copy of this order together with a copy
of the proposed settlement agreement hereto attached.

      5) SHAREHOLDER OBJECTIONS. Any shareholder or other affected party to
these lawsuits who wishes to object to the proposed settlement shall, not later
than the close of business at the office of the Clerk of this Circuit seven (7)
days before the date set for the consideration by the Court of the settlement
proposal in p. 2, above: a) file with the Clerk of this Court and b) serve upon
all counsel of record such objection, if any, as he may have to the settlement
or to the specific terms thereof. No objection not filed and served in
conformity with this Order will be considered by the Court at the hearing set
hereby.

      6) PROCEDURE AT THE HEARING. The hearing will take up, first, any
objections to the settlement made by shareholders or other affected parties to
these lawsuits; and, second, the fairness of the settlement, including
attorneys' fees and expenses to be awarded to Plaintiffs' counsel.

Done this the 22nd day of December, 2004.
