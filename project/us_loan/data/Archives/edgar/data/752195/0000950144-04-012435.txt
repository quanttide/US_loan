ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.

      On December 22, 2004 Community Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company") entered
into a Pro Tanto Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") with respect to the
shareholder derivative cases styled M. Lewis Benson, et al. v. Community
Bancshares, Inc., et al. and John M. Packard, Jr., et al. v. Sheffield
Electrical Contractors, Inc., et al. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will
recover a total of $625,000 and all of the individual defendants in the lawsuits
(except for Kennon R. Patterson, Sr., Jimmy Childers and Dewey Hamaker) will be
released from liability. On December 22, 2004 the Circuit Court of Blount
County, Alabama entered an Order Setting a Hearing on a Proposed Settlement
Agreement (the "Order"). A hearing on the fairness of the Agreement is scheduled
for 1:00 p.m. on January 31, 2005 at the Blount County Courthouse in Oneonta,
Alabama. The Order provides that any stockholder of the Company wishing to
object to the Agreement must file the objection with the Clerk of Court no later
than the close of business on January 24, 2005 and must serve the objection on
all attorneys of record in the lawsuits. Pursuant to General Instruction F to
Form 8-K, the Agreement and the Order are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and
99.2, respectively, and are incorporated into this Item 8.01 by reference.
Copies of the Agreement and the Order will be mailed to all stockholders of
record.

      On December 21, 2004 the Company and Travelers Casualty & Surety Company
of America ("Travelers") agreed to a settlement of the claim made by the Company
under the fidelity bond issued by Travelers, which claim is the subject of
pending litigation filed by the Company. Pursuant to this settlement, the
Company will receive $450,000 and will release Travelers from any further
liability under the fidelity bond. Travelers will release all claims against
past and present officers and directors of the Company, but will retain
subrogation rights with respect to any restitution order entered in a criminal
or administrative proceeding against Kennon R. Patterson, Sr. or Larry Bishop.
The settlement also provides that in the event the Company obtains a judgment
and recovery in the lawsuit filed by the Company against Mr. Patterson, the
Company will first recover its costs of litigation and collection and then
Travelers will be entitled to the proceeds of such litigation up to the amount
of its payment under the bond.

                         Pro Tanto Settlement Agreement

      The parties principally involved in these lawsuits have reached an
agreement -- contingent upon its approval by the Circuit Court of Blount County,
Alabama after all appropriate notices, and upon its not being altered (except as
hereafter appears) in any appellate proceeding -- to settle, pro tanto, these
lawsuits.

      This is a statement of the terms of that agreement.

      1) This agreement cannot be construed or represented as an admission or
other evidence of liability.

      2) The defendants making this settlement are all of the individual
defendants in this case (known hereinafter as the "Director Defendants") except
for Kennon R. Patterson, Sr., Jimmy Childers, and Dewey Hamaker.

      3) The defendants Edward Ferguson, Denny G. Kelly, Hodge Patterson, Kennon
R. Patterson, Jr., Merritt Robbins, Loy McGruder, Robert O. Summerford, and
Bishop K. Walker, Jr., no longer serve as Directors of either Community Bank or
of Community Bancshares, Inc.,

<PAGE>

but are included as "Director Defendants" in the text herein.

      4) Larry Bishop is not a Director Defendant but is a person included in
this settlement agreement. As a part of this agreement, Bishop agrees that he
will not seek or accept employment in the future by any federally insured
financial institution and will execute a written statement to that effect for
delivery to the regulatory agencies affected. Larry Bishop also will release the
named derivative plaintiffs, Community Bank, Community Bancshares, Inc., and the
Director Defendants from any and all claims of whatsoever nature; Community Bank
and Community Bancshares, Inc., (for themselves and on behalf of their past and
present officers, directors, and agents) will release Larry Bishop from any and
all claims of whatsoever nature.

      5) On behalf of the Director Defendants, the sum of One Million Six
Hundred Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($1,675,000.00) will be paid by their
insurance carrier, subject to the approval of the Court, as follows:

a)    $1,035,000.00 (but not more than that) to Maynard, Cooper & Gale as and
      for their fees and expenses as attorneys for the derivative plaintiffs in
      both pending lawsuits;

b)    $625,000 to Community Bank and/or Community Bancshares, Inc. (as they may
      between themselves allocate) as damages recovered by them for both
      actions; and,

c)    $5,000.00 each (for a total payment of $15,000.00) to the derivative
      plaintiffs, viz., Dr. Packard, Dr. Mann, and Dr. and Mrs. Benson
      (jointly), in recognition of their service as named plaintiffs on behalf
      of the corporations, and as compensation for any individual claims
      asserted in these two actions only. The derivative plaintiffs will release
      no personal claims against Community Bank and Community Bancshares, Inc.,
      other than those set out in the two captioned cases.

      6) If the Court sets the amount of the fee and expenses to be paid to
Maynard, Cooper & Gale as counsel for the derivative plaintiffs at a sum less
than the $1,035,000 paid for that purpose, the derivative plaintiffs and their
counsel have the right to appeal such lesser award. The right to appeal the
award of a fee and expenses less than the agreed amount shall not affect in any
other respect the validity and finality of any judgment of the Circuit Court of
Blount County, Alabama, approving the settlement.

      7) The Director Defendants (by and through their insurance company) shall
pay the agreed amount to those entitled to receive it the next business day
following the expiration of the time for taking an appeal from an order of the
Circuit Court of Blount County, Alabama approving this settlement. Payment of
the agreed amount shall fully and completely release the Director Defendants and
Larry Bishop from any and all further liability herein.

      8) If any shareholder or other affected party to these lawsuits files an
appeal, before the expiration of the time for taking an appeal, from an order of
the Circuit Court of Blount County, Alabama, approving this settlement, then the
payments called for by this settlement shall be paid to those entitled to
receive them not later than five (5) business days following the entry of a
final order in the appeals courts affirming the order of the Circuit Court of
Blount County, Alabama, approving this settlement.

      9) If an appeal is taken with respect to the amount of the payment to
Maynard, Cooper & Gale for its fee and expenses and, after the final action of
any appellate court, there remains any difference between the amount awarded and
or fixed after any such appeal, then and in that case any such remaining balance
of the payment contemplated in Section 5, above, shall be paid to

<PAGE>

Community Bank as its additional damages herein.

      10) In exchange for the above, all Bank-related defendants (i. e,
Community Bancshares, Inc., Community Bank, all Director Defendants, and Larry
Bishop) save and except Kennon R. Patterson, Sr., will be dismissed with
prejudice from these two actions.

      11) Community Bank shall be realigned as party plaintiff in the two
actions to pursue, to the extent that it deems appropriate and in the best
interests of the Bank and Community Bancshares, Inc., any remaining defendants,
the derivative plaintiffs shall be dismissed as parties to the two actions, and
the lawsuits shall proceed thenceforth as regular civil actions and not as
derivative lawsuits.

      12) All parties to this agreement will give their best efforts to
accomplish the settlement so soon as practicable.

      13) This Settlement Agreement is conditioned upon and entered into in
anticipation of the settlement and dismissal of the action styled Community Bank
and Community Bancshares, Inc., vs. Travelers Casualty & Surety Company of
America now pending as CV 04-BE-2885-S in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Alabama, Southern Division, the consequential dismissal
of all third-party and other ancillary claims against the Director Defendants
and Larry Bishop therein pending, and Travelers' Motion for Leave to Intervene
in these actions. The parties are informed that an agreement to accomplish that
result has been reached as of 21st December, 2004, between Community Bank and
Community Bancshares, Inc., on the one hand, and Travelers Casualty & Surety
Company of America on the other. Should that settlement fail to be accomplished,
then this Pro Tanto Settlement Agreement will become ineffective.

      Witness our hands this the 22nd day of December, 2004.

vs.

           ORDER SETTING A HEARING ON A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

      The Court has been informed that an agreement amongst the principally
affected parties to this litigation, -- viz., Community Bank, Community
Bancshares, Inc., some past and present individually named directors and
officers of those two entities (with the exception of the defendant Kennon R.
Patterson, Sr.), and the derivative plaintiffs (Dr. and Mrs. Benson, Dr.
Packard, and Dr. Mann) -- has been reached. At the request of those parties,
therefore, and upon good cause shown to the Court,

      IT IS ORDERED BY THE COURT AS FOLLOWS:

      1) SUBSTITUTION OF THE NEW AGREEMENT. The Settlement Agreement dated 22nd
December 2004 between and among Community Bank, Community Bancshares, Inc., the
officers and directors of those entities named in the Complaint (other than
Kennon R. Patterson, Sr.), and the derivative plaintiffs (a copy of which
Settlement Agreement is hereto attached) is substituted

<PAGE>

for any agreement of settlement previously proposed to the Court for approval
and shall, for all purposes, be considered by the Court as superseding all
former proposed agreements.

      2) DATE AND HOUR FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE NEW AGREEMENT. The Court will
hear objections, if any, to the attached Settlement Agreement and to the
application of counsel for the derivative plaintiffs for an award of fees and
expenses and also will consider the fairness of the agreement to all affected
parties on the 31st day of January, 2005, at 1:00 p.m.

      3) APPLICATION OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES. The payment of attorneys'
fees and expenses to Plaintiffs' counsel will be considered as part of the
overall fairness of the settlement at the scheduled hearing.

      4) NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND OBJECTIONS. Within seven (7) days from the
date of this order, Community Bancshares, Inc., will despatch to all of its
shareholders of record as of this date a copy of this order together with a copy
of the proposed settlement agreement hereto attached.

      5) SHAREHOLDER OBJECTIONS. Any shareholder or other affected party to
these lawsuits who wishes to object to the proposed settlement shall, not later
than the close of business at the office of the Clerk of this Circuit seven (7)
days before the date set for the consideration by the Court of the settlement
proposal in p. 2, above: a) file with the Clerk of this Court and b) serve upon
all counsel of record such objection, if any, as he may have to the settlement
or to the specific terms thereof. No objection not filed and served in
conformity with this Order will be considered by the Court at the hearing set
hereby.

      6) PROCEDURE AT THE HEARING. The hearing will take up, first, any
objections to the settlement made by shareholders or other affected parties to
these lawsuits; and, second, the fairness of the settlement, including
attorneys' fees and expenses to be awarded to Plaintiffs' counsel.

Done this the 22nd day of December, 2004.
