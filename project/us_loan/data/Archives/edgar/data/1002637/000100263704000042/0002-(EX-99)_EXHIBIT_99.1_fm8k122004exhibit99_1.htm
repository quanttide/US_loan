<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Cambridge, Mass., December 20,
2004 &#150;</B>&nbsp;Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MLNM) today announced
Kenneth Bate, executive vice president and head of commercial operations, has decided to
leave the company in January 2005.  Millennium is actively recruiting a successor to
lead the Company&#146;s commercial organization. Upon Mr. Bate&#146;s departure, oversight
of the commercial organization will immediately transition to Mark Levin, chief executive
officer and chairperson of Millennium. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Flush" FSL="Default" -->
     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Mr. Bate joined Millennium as chief financial officer in 2002 and assumed the
          additional role of head of commercial operations in 2003. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;I want to thank Ken for his
commitment to Millennium, our employees and the patients we serve. He has been
instrumental in the implementation of our plan to reach profitability and in the successes
of the Company&#146;s commercial organization during the past two years. We greatly
appreciate his significant contributions,&#148; said Levin. &#147;We will continue to seek extraordinary executives with deep
commercial biopharmaceutical experience as we are moving into the next phase of our development.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Separately, Millennium also announced
the departure of three Board members. Ginger Graham, the president and chief executive
officer of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Vaughn Kailian, the managing partner of Deerhaven
Partners and Edward Miller, M.D., the chief executive officer and dean of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine will all be leaving the Board effective January
2005. During 2005, Mr. Kailian will continue to provide services to the Company through a
consulting agreement. Shaun Coughlin, M.D., Ph.D., Grant Heidrich, Charles Homcy, M.D.,
Raju Kucherlapati, Ph.D., Eric Lander, Ph.D., Mark Levin, Norman Selby and Kenneth Weg
will continue to serve on the Board. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;The Company has benefited
greatly from the contributions and guidance Ginger and Vaughn, who joined us in connection
with the COR merger, and Ed, who joined us in 2000, have all provided. We wish them all
the best as they focus on their own demanding endeavors,&#148; said Levin. &#147;Our Board
Governance Committee is currently in discussions with prospective independent directors
who would bring the strong financial, biopharmaceutical and public policy backgrounds that
Millennium needs in the next phase of its evolution into a leading biopharmaceutical
company.&#148; </FONT></P>
