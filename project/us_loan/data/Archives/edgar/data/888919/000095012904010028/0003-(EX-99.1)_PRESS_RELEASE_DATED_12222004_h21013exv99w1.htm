<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>HCC MAKES ELECTION UNDER
ITS CONVERTIBLES AND COMMENTS ON EARNINGS ESTIMATES</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">HOUSTON (December&nbsp;22, 2004) . . .<BR>
<B>HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE symbol: HCC) </B>announced today that the Company has made
elections under the indentures related to its 1.30% Convertible Notes due 2023 (1.30% Notes) and
its 2.00% Convertible Notes due 2021 (2.00% Notes) to substantially reduce the earnings per share
dilution of the Notes that would have otherwise resulted.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">After analysis of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;04-8, a new accounting pronouncement which becomes effective
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and a proposed FASB pronouncement, HCC has decided to irrevocably elect under
both Convertible Notes, where applicable, to (i)&nbsp;satisfy the conversion obligation in cash up to
the principal amount of the Notes and in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock for any amount in
excess of the principal amount; (ii)&nbsp;pay the change of control purchase price solely in cash; and
(iii)&nbsp;pay the purchase price solely in cash if holders exercise their option to require the Company
to repurchase their Notes. This election allows HCC to utilize the &#145;treasury stock&#146; method rather
than the &#145;if converted&#146; method when calculating diluted earnings per share, thus substantially
reducing any dilution to earnings per share.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, effective December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company will retroactively change its calculation of
diluted earnings per share amounts to reflect the new accounting change. With the Company&#146;s
election under the Notes as stated above, the new accounting change has no effect on the previously
reported diluted earnings per share for the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 or the nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Stephen L. Way, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, &#147;Notwithstanding this accounting change
and our recent equity offering, we expect to meet or beat the consensus earnings estimate for the
fourth quarter 2004 and remain very optimistic about 2005.&#148; Mr.&nbsp;Way added, &#147;We anticipate being in
a position to provide guidance for next years earnings, in due course.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The new pronouncement does not change the calculation of basic earnings per share, or have any
effect on shareholders&#146; equity, or book value per share.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">HCC is an international insurance holding company and a leading specialty insurance group since
1974, based in Houston, Texas with offices across the USA and in Bermuda, England and Spain. HCC
has assets of more than $5.5&nbsp;billion, shareholders&#146; equity of over $1.25
billion and is rated AA (Very Strong) by Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s and A&#043; (Superior) by A.M. Best Company.
