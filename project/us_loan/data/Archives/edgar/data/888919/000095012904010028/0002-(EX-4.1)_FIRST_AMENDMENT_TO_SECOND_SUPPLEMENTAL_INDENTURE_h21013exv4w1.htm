23, 2001 (the &#147;Indenture,&#148; all capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture) providing for the issuance
by the Company of Securities from time to time;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and the Trustee entered into that certain Second Supplemental Indenture
dated as of March&nbsp;28, 2003 (the &#147;Supplemental Indenture&#148;) for the purposes of establishing the
terms of a new series of Securities under the Indenture;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.13 of the Supplemental Indenture, upon a conversion pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.01 or Section&nbsp;2.02, the Company may, at its option, satisfy its Conversion Obligation in
cash, Common Stock, or any combination thereof;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.01 of the Supplemental Indenture, the holders of the Notes have
the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes on each Purchase Date and the Company may,
at its option, pay the Purchase Price in cash, Common Stock, or any combination thereof;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.02 of the Supplemental Indenture, upon a purchase of the Notes

provisions of this Article&nbsp;2, at any time following the issuance of the Notes and
prior to the close of business on April&nbsp;1, 2023 a Holder of a Note (or any portion
of the principal amount thereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000),

provided in Section&nbsp;2.02 into an amount of cash and the number of shares of Common
Stock, if any, as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">The amount of cash to be paid for each $1,000 of principal amount of a Note to be

and (ii)&nbsp;the conversion value of the Note to be converted during the 10 Trading Day
period which period shall begin the day after the Holder delivers a conversion
notice pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.02 (the &#147;Cash Settlement Averaging Period&#148;) calculated
as the average during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period of the Conversion Rate on
each day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period times the Sales Price of the
Company&#146;s Common Stock on each such day. The Conversion Rate shall be equal to
$1,000 divided by the Conversion Price.

Averaging Period of the Conversion Rate in effect on each Trading Date of the Cash
Settlement Averaging Period less the result of the principal amount of the Note
being converted divided by the Sale Price of the shares of
Common Stock on each such Trading Day; provided, however, that the number of shares
of Common Stock to be paid shall not be less than zero.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">Settlement in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock will occur
the day following the final day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">Holders may surrender Notes for conversion on any date within a calendar quarter if,
as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter, the Sale Price of the Common
Stock for at least 20 consecutive Trading Days in a period of 30 consecutive Trading
Days ending on the last Trading Day of the quarter is more than 130% of the
Conversion Price on the last Trading Day of the quarter. The Conversion Agent will,
on behalf of the Company, determine at the end of each quarter if the Notes are
convertible and notify the Company and the Trustee and, upon receipt of such
determination each quarter, if the Notes are convertible, the Company shall issue a
press release indicating that the Notes are convertible and publish such information
on the Company&#146;s web site.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">In addition, even if the condition in the preceding paragraph has not been
satisfied, a Holder may surrender for conversion a Note or portion of a Note:

pursuant to Article&nbsp;3 hereof, until the close of business on the day that is two
Business Days prior to the Redemption Date unless the Company defaults on payment of
the Redemption Price in which case the conversion right shall terminate at the close
of business on the date such default is cured and such payment is made;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) if the Company consolidates with or merges into another corporation, or is
a party to a binding share exchange pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock
would be converted into cash, securities or other property as set forth in Section
2.04 hereof, at any time from and after the date which is 15&nbsp;days prior to the date

credit rating assigned to the Notes by such rating agency is suspended or withdrawn
or (C)&nbsp;such rating agency is not then rating the Notes.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">A Note in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Purchase Notice or Change of
Control Purchase Notice pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.01 or Section&nbsp;4.02 exercising the
option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Note may be converted
only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of such
Section, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the applicable Purchase Price
or Change of Control Purchase Price, in which case such Note may be converted
without such withdrawal until such default is cured and such payment is made.&#148;

conversion privilege, the Holder of any Note to be converted shall surrender such
Note, duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee, located at 5847 San Felipe, Suite&nbsp;1050, Houston, Texas 77057,
Attn: Kevin M. Dobrava, accompanied by a duly signed and completed written notice to
the Company at the Corporate Trust Office that the Holder elects to convert such
Note. Notes that are surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of
business on any Regular Record Date immediately preceding any Interest Payment Date
to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date shall (except in the case
of Notes or portions thereof which have been called for redemption or in respect of
which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice delivered by the Holder
has not been withdrawn, the conversion rights of which would terminate during the
period between such Regular Record Date and the close of business on such Interest
Payment Date) be accompanied by payment in immediately available funds or other
funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on such
Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of Notes being surrendered for
conversion; <I>provided, however</I>, that no such payment shall be required if there shall
exist at the time of conversion a default in the payment of interest on the Notes.
No payment or adjustment shall be made upon any conversion on account of any
interest accrued on the Notes surrendered for conversion from the Interest Payment
Date preceding the day of conversion. Rather, such amount shall be deemed to be
paid in full to the Holder through delivery of cash or a combination of cash and
Common Stock, in exchange for the Note being converted pursuant to the provisions
hereof, and the fair market value of the combination of cash and any shares of
Common Stock shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange
for accrued and unpaid interest and the balance, if any, of such fair market value
of any such Common Stock and any cash payment shall be treated as issued in exchange
for the principal amount of the Note being converted pursuant to the provisions
hereof. In addition, no adjustment or payment shall be made upon any conversion on
account of any dividends on any Common Stock issued upon conversion. In addition,
Holders shall not be entitled to receive any dividends payable to holders of Common
Stock as of any Record Date before the close of business on the conversion date.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">Notes shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of
business on the day of surrender of such Notes for conversion in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the Holders of such Notes as
Holders shall cease, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive any Common Stock
issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or
holders of any such Common Stock at such time. As promptly as practicable on or
after the conversion date, the Company shall issue and shall
deliver to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office a certificate or certificates
for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, together
with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share thereof, as provided in Section&nbsp;2.03
hereof, and the cash payment, and the Trustee shall forward such certificate or
certificates and cash at the addresses set forth in the written notices sent to the
Company by the Holders electing to convert their Notes.&#148;

such Common Stock and any cash payment shall be treated as issued in exchange for the principal

or payment shall be made upon any conversion on account of any dividends on any Common Stock issued upon conversion.
In addition, Holders shall not be entitled to receive any dividends payable to holders of Common
Stock as of any Record Date before the close of business on the conversion date.
