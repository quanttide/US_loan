ITEM 3.02.        UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

On December 10, 2004,  Discovery  Laboratories,  Inc. (the "Company")  delivered
notice to  Kingsbridge  Capital  Limited  ("Kingsbridge")  of its  intention  to
conduct a  financing  of up to  $12,000,000  pursuant  to the  Committed  Equity
Financing  Facility  ("CEFF")  entered into with  Kingsbridge  in July 2004.  As
previously disclosed,  financings under the CEFF are conducted and priced over a
15-trading day period (the "Financing  Period").  For each Financing Period, the
Company specifies in advance a minimum acceptable purchase price (the "Threshold
Price") for the issuance of any shares of the Company's  common stock, par value
$.001 per share (the "Common Stock"),  to Kingsbridge.  Shares will be purchased
and issued to  Kingsbridge  only in respect of trading  days on which the market
price  (defined  as the volume  weighted  average  sales  price per share of the
Common  Stock  during any  trading day as  reported  by  Bloomberg,  hereinafter
referred to as "Market Price"), after giving effect to discounts ranging from 6%
to 10% as stipulated in the CEFF,  equals or exceeds the  Threshold  Price.  For
each such trading day that the  Threshold  Price is met or exceeded,  the actual
purchase  price for shares that are issued to Kingsbridge is equal to the Market
Price on such trading day, less a discount ranging from 6% to 10%.

As of  December  29,  2004,  twelve  trading  days of the  Financing  Period had
transpired  and the Company  issued 901,742 shares (the "Shares") to Kingsbridge
(with 489,249  shares settled on December 22, 2004 and 412,493 shares settled on
December 29, 2004) for  aggregate  cash proceeds to the Company of $7.2 million.
To date,  the  Threshold  Price was met or  exceeded  for nine out of the twelve
trading days and the average Market Price for those nine trading days was $8.84.
The average price of the Shares issued to Kingsbridge, after taking into account
the  applicable  discount rate provided for by the CEFF,  was $7.98.  Should the
Market Price,  after giving effect to discounts  ranging from 6% to 10%, meet or
exceed the Threshold Price for each of the three remaining days of the Financing
Period,  the Company may realize  additional  cash proceeds from the issuance of
additional  shares under the CEFF of up to $2.4 million.  The Shares were issued
to Kingsbridge in a private  transaction  exempt from  registration  pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

As previously disclosed,  pursuant to the CEFF, the Company may access up to $75
million from  Kingsbridge  in exchange for  newly-issued  shares of Common Stock
over a three year period ending in October 2007.  Capital may be accessed  under
the CEFF in tranches of up to $18.75 million, subject to certain conditions. The
Company  is not  obligated  to  further  utilize  any of the  remaining  capital
available  under the CEFF and there are no minimum  commitment  or  minimum  use
penalties.

The Common Stock issued or issuable to Kingsbridge under the CEFF was registered
for resale pursuant to the registration  statement on Form S-3, No.  333-118595,
filed by the Company with the United States  Securities and Exchange  Commission
on August 26, 2004, and declared effective on October 27, 2004.
