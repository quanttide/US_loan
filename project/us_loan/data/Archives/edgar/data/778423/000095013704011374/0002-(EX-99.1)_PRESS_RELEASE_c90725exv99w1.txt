         According to Smith Travel Research, preliminary results for November
2004 indicate that RevPAR for the midscale without food and beverage segment of
the lodging industry increased 8 percent to 10 percent, compared to November
2003. Most of the company's hotels are located in the Midwest, including Ohio,
Michigan and Illinois, where the lodging industry is recovering at a much slower
rate than the rest of the country, according to Smith Travel Research.

SALES ACTIVITY

         The company facilitated the sale of one leased AmeriHost Inn hotel in
December 2004. The impact of the sale of this hotel, and the related lease
termination, will be reported in the company's financial statements during the
quarter in which the sale transaction closes. Year to date, including this
disposition, the company has divested 15 hotels. The company has sold nine
wholly owned AmeriHost Inn hotels, sold two wholly owned non-AmeriHost Inn
hotels, facilitated the sale of one non-AmeriHost Inn hotel owned by a joint
venture, facilitated the sale of two leased AmeriHost Inn hotels on behalf of
PMC, the landlord, and sold its ownership interest in a non-AmeriHost Inn joint
venture.

         The company currently has eight hotels under contract for sale,
including three leased hotels, which are expected to be consummated within the
next six months. When the company has hotels under contract for sale, even with
nonrefundable cash deposits in certain cases, certain conditions to closing
remain, and there can be no assurance that these sales will be consummated as
anticipated.

HOTEL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY

         The company continues its construction of an AmeriHost Inn & Suites
hotel in Lansing, Mich. for a joint venture in which it is a partner. In
addition, the company expects to close on the debt and equity financing for an
87-room AmeriHost Inn & Suites at the Columbus, Ohio airport in the next 90
days, pending final entitlements and site work required by the seller, at which
time Arlington will commence construction.

         The company has several other projects in the pre-construction
development stage. The sales and development activities set forth above do not
represent guidance on, or forecasts of, the results of the company's entire
consolidated operations, which are reported on a quarterly basis.

development opportunities either on a joint venture or turnkey basis, contact
