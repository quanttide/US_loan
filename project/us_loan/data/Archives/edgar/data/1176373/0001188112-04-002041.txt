ITEM 2.01     COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

CYPRUS BUILDING

        On December 16, 2004, Behringer Harvard REIT I, Inc., (the "Registrant")
acquired a four-story office building containing approximately 153,048 rentable
square feet located on approximately 8.2 acres of land in Englewood, Colorado, a
suburb of Denver (the "Cyprus Building") through Behringer Harvard Cyprus, LLC,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Behringer Harvard Operating Partnership I LP, the
Registrant's operating partnership. The contract purchase price of the Cyprus
Building, exclusive of closing costs and initial escrows, was $19,800,000. The
Registrant used proceeds from its public offering to pay the entire purchase
price and all closing costs of the acquisition.

        The purchase price for the transaction was determined through
negotiations between the Cyprus Building seller, PERA Mineral, Inc., an
unrelated third party, and Behringer Advisors LP, the Registrant's advisor. In
evaluating the Cyprus Building as a potential acquisition and determining
whether the amount of consideration to be paid was appropriate, a variety of
factors were considered, including overall valuation of net rental income
(defined as revenues from the tenant from rent and expense reimbursements less
the Cyprus Building's actual operating expenses), expected capital expenditures,
costs of physical plant maintenance, location, environmental issues,
demographics, quality of the tenant, length of lease, price per square foot and
occupancy. The Registrant's advisor believes that the Cyprus Building is well
located, has acceptable roadway access, attracts a high-quality tenant, is well
maintained, adequately insured and has been professionally managed.

        The Cyprus Building, which was constructed in 1988, is 100% leased to
one tenant, Phelps Dodge Corporation. The tenant does not currently occupy the
building and the building is vacant as of the closing date.

        Phelps Dodge Corporation is an international mineral and chemical
producer. Phelps Dodge leases 153,048 square feet for an annual rent of
$2,408,885 under a lease that expires in October 2008. Phelps Dodge has three
five-year renewal options available.

        HPT Management Services LP (the "Cyprus Property Manager"), an affiliate
of the Registrant, has the sole and exclusive right to manage, operate, lease
and supervise the overall maintenance of the Cyprus Building. Among other
things, the Cyprus Property Manager will have the authority to negotiate and
enter into leases of the property on behalf of the Registrant, to incur costs
and expenses, to pay property operating costs and expenses from property cash
flow or reserves and to require that the Registrant provide sufficient funds for
the payment of operating expenses. The Cyprus Property Manager has subcontracted
certain of its on-site management services and all leasing services to Trammell
Crow Services, Inc.

        As compensation for its services, the Cyprus Property Manager or its
affiliates is entitled to the following reimbursements for its out-of-pocket
costs and on-site personnel costs and the following compensation:

1.      A property management fee equal to 3% of the monthly gross revenues from
        the Cyprus Building.

2.      An annual asset management fee equal to 0.5% of the asset value.

        Leasing commission of 6% will be paid on any new leases to be divided 4%
to the outside broker and 2% paid to Trammel Crow Services, Inc. On lease
renewals, a total commission of 4% will be paid with 2% paid to the outside
broker and 2% paid to Trammell Crow Services, Inc.

PRATT BUILDING

        On December 17, 2004, the Registrant acquired an undivided 50.67995%
tenant in common interest in a 24-story office building containing approximately
368,194 rentable square feet located on approximately 0.75 acres of land in
Baltimore, Maryland (the "Pratt Building"). The contract purchase price of the
Pratt Building, exclusive of closing costs and initial escrows, was $51,816,488.
The Registrant used borrowings of $18,751,582 under a loan agreement (the "Pratt
Loan Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp. (the "Pratt Lender")
to pay a portion of its share of such contract purchase price and paid the
remaining amount from proceeds of the Registrant's offering of its common stock
to the public. For a description of the Pratt Loan Agreement, see Item 2.03
below. The Registrant's tenant in common interest is held by Behringer Harvard
Pratt H, LLC, an entity that is wholly owned by the Registrant's operating
partnership, Behringer Harvard Operating Partnership I LP. The purchase price
for the transaction was determined through negotiations between the Pratt
Building seller, Trizec 250 W. Pratt, LLC, an unrelated third party, and
Behringer Advisors LP, the Registrant's advisor. In evaluating the Pratt
Building as a potential acquisition and determining the appropriate amount of
consideration to be paid for the Registrant's interest in the Pratt Building, a
variety of factors were considered, including overall valuation of net rental
income (defined as revenues from the tenants from rent and expense
reimbursements less the Pratt Building's actual operating expenses), expected
capital expenditures, costs of physical plant maintenance, location,
environmental issues, demographics, tenant mix, quality of tenants, length of
leases, price per square foot and occupancy. The Registrant's advisor believes
that the Pratt Building is well located, has acceptable roadway access, attracts
high-quality tenants, is well maintained, adequately insured and has been
professionally managed.

        The Pratt Building, which was constructed in 1986, is approximately 76%
leased and includes the following major tenants: Vertis, Inc. ("Vertis"), Semmes
Bowen & Semmes ("Semmes") and the United States General Services Administration
(the "GSA").

        Vertis is a provider of targeted advertising, media and marketing
services. Vertis leases 57,631 square feet for an annual rent of $1,618,304
under a lease that expires in August 2007, with a five-year renewal option
available.

        Semmes is a full-service law firm with a national civil practice. Semmes
leases 48,426 square feet for an annual rent of $1,328,805 under a lease that
expires in April 2008.

        The GSA assists and supports Federal Agencies by offering superior
workplaces, expert solutions, acquisition services and management policies. The
GSA leases 41,000 square feet for an annual rent of $1,086,500 under a lease
that expires in June 2007, with a five-year renewal option available.

        The remaining 49.32005% tenant in common interest in the Pratt Building
was acquired by various investors who purchased their interests in a private
offering sponsored by the Registrant's affiliate, Behringer Harvard Holdings,
LLC. Each tenant in common investor, including the Registrant, is a borrower
under the Pratt Loan Agreement.

        The tenants in common, including the Registrant, have also entered into
both a Tenants in Common Agreement (the "Pratt Tenants in Common Agreement") and
a Property and Asset Management Agreement (the "Pratt Property Management
Agreement") with Behringer Harvard TIC Management Services LP (the "Pratt
Property Manager"). The tenants in common are each obligated to pay their pro
rata share of any future cash contributions required in connection with the
ownership, operation, management and maintenance of the Pratt Building, as
determined by the Pratt Property Manager. Under the Pratt Tenants in Common
Agreement, if any tenant in common fails to pay any required cash contribution,
any other tenant in common may pay such

                                       3
<PAGE>

amount. The nonpaying tenant in common is required to reimburse the paying
tenant(s) in common within 30 days, together with interest at 10% per annum (but
not more than the maximum rate allowed by law). Under the Pratt Property
Management Agreement, the Pratt Property Manager may also withhold distributions
to the nonpaying tenant in common and pay such distributions to the paying
tenant(s) in common until such reimbursement is paid in full. In addition, the
paying tenant(s) in common may be able to obtain a lien against the undivided
interest in the property of the nonpaying tenant in common and exercise other
legal remedies. The tenants in common are also required to indemnify the other
tenants in common to the extent such other person pays for a liability of a
tenant in common or in the event a tenant in common causes a liability as a
result of such tenant in common's actions or inactions.

        All of the tenants in common must approve certain decisions relating to
the Pratt Building, including any future sale, exchange, lease or release of all
or a portion of the Pratt Building, any loans or modifications of any loans
secured by the Pratt Building, the approval of any property management
agreement, or any extension, renewal or modification thereof. All other
decisions relating to the Pratt Building require the approval of a majority of
the tenants in common. If a tenant in common votes against or fails to consent
to any action that requires the unanimous approval of the tenants in common when
at least 50% of the tenants in common have voted or provided consent for such
action, Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC or its affiliates have the option, but
not the obligation, to purchase such dissenting tenant in common's interest for
fair market value.

        Each tenant in common may sell, transfer, convey, pledge, encumber or
hypothecate its undivided interest in the Pratt Building or any part thereof,
provided that any transferee shall take such interest subject to the Pratt
Tenants in Common Agreement and the Pratt Property Management Agreement (to the
extent that the Pratt Property Management Agreement is then in effect);
provided, further however, such party must provide first to Behringer Harvard
Pratt H, LLC and its affiliates and second to the other tenants in common, the
right to make an offer to purchase such selling party's interest.

        Under the Pratt Tenants in Common Agreement, all income, expenses, loss,
liabilities and cash flow from the Pratt Building, and all cash proceeds from
any sale, exchange or refinancing of the property, and all liabilities of the
property (except for items separately determined such as real estate taxes and
management fees), are allocated to the tenants in common in proportion to their
undivided interests in the property.

        The tenants in common have no right to possession of the Pratt Building.
However, subject to the restrictions of the Pratt Loan Agreement, any tenant in
common may partition the Pratt Building subject to first offering to sell its
undivided interest to Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC or its affiliates at fair
market value and second, offering to sell its undivided interest to the other
tenants in common at fair market value.

        The Tenants in Common Agreement provides Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC
or its affiliates with an option, but not the obligation, to purchase any
defaulting tenant in common's undivided interest in the Pratt Building at fair
market value. A defaulting tenant in common is any tenant in common who is in
default under the Pratt Loan Agreement, the Pratt Property Management Agreement
and/or the Pratt Tenants in Common Agreement.

        In addition, Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC has the option, but not the
obligation, to purchase all of the tenants in common's undivided interests in
the Pratt Building by providing notice of its election to exercise this option
to the tenants in common upon the earlier of (i) during the last year prior to
the expiration of the Pratt Loan Agreement, (ii) the announcement by the
Registrant of its intention to liquidate its assets or (iii) the announcement by
the Registrant of its intention to liquidate its investment portfolio or to list
its equity securities on any national

                                       4
<PAGE>

securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. In the Registrant's discretion,
it may offer the tenants in common the option to exchange their interests for
equity securities ("Exchange Securities") in the Registrant or its operating
partnership, Behringer Harvard Operating Partnership I LP, at their fair market
value. In the event that the Registrant exercises the option and does not offer
the tenants in common the option to exchange their interests for the Exchange
Securities or a tenant in common elects not to exchange its interest for the
Exchange Securities, the purchase price is paid in cash.

        The Pratt Property Management Agreement remains in effect until the
earlier to occur of (i) the sale of the Pratt Building or any portion thereof,
as to only such portion of the Pratt Building sold (other than any sale of an
undivided interest held by a tenant in common to a party that will acquire such
interest subject to the Pratt Tenants in Common Agreement and the Pratt Property
Management Agreement), or (ii) December 31, 2030; provided, however, the Pratt
Property Management Agreement terminates on December 31, 2004 and each
anniversary of such date unless all of the tenants in common consent to the
continuation of the Property Management Agreement. In addition, the Pratt
Property Management Agreement may be terminated by the Pratt Property Manager
for any reason upon 60-days written notice or in the event the tenants in common
are in default in the performance of any of their obligations under the
agreement and such default remains uncured for 30 days following written notice.

        The Pratt Property Manager has the sole and exclusive right to manage,
operate, lease and supervise the overall maintenance of the Pratt Building.
Among other things, the Pratt Property Manager has the authority to negotiate
and enter into leases of the Pratt Building on behalf of the tenants in common
(in substantial conformance with approved leasing parameters and the operating
plan), to incur costs and expenses, to pay property operating costs and expenses
from property cash flow or reserves and to require additional cash contributions
from the tenants in common.

        As compensation for its services, the Pratt Property Manager or its
affiliates is entitled to the following reimbursements for its out-of-pocket
costs and on-site personnel costs and the following compensation:

1.      A property management fee equal to 3% of the monthly gross revenues from
the Pratt Building. Upon a sale of the Pratt Building, the Pratt Property
Manager shall receive additional compensation equal to the previous month's
property management fee as compensation for work to be performed in connection
with the sale or completion of managing matters relating to each tenant.

2.      An annual asset management fee of $180,000 for supervising the overall
management and operation of the Pratt Building. The asset management fee is pro
rated for any partial year and shall be payable pro rata on a monthly basis on
the first day of each month. The Pratt Property Manager may defer, in its sole
discretion, all or any portion of such asset management fee. Any such unpaid
asset management fees shall, in all events, be paid upon the earliest to occur
of the following events: (i) the termination of the Pratt Property Management
Agreement, (ii) the sale of the Pratt Building, or (iii) ten years from the
accrual of any such unpaid asset management fee. Upon termination of the Pratt
Property Management Agreement or upon a sale of the Pratt Building, the parties
will prorate the asset management fee on a daily basis to the effective date of
such cancellation or termination.

3.      A leasing commission equal to (i) 6% of first year base rent, 4% of
second and third year base rent, 3% of fourth and fifth year base rent, and 2%
of all subsequent years' base rent of any new lease or expansion that is not
co-brokered; (such commission rates referred to herein as the "Baltimore
Rates"); (ii) for new leases or expansions of leases that are co-brokered, the
Property Manager receives one-half of the Baltimore Rates and the co-broker
receives the full Baltimore

                                       5
<PAGE>

Rates; (iii) 2% of base rent of lease extensions and renewals that are not
co-brokered; or (iv) 2% of base rent of lease extensions and renewals that are
co-brokered and an additional 2% payable to the co-broker.

4.      A construction management fee equal to 5% of any amount (including
related professional services) expended for construction, tenant improvement or
repair projects with respect to the Pratt Building.

5.      A financing fee equal to 1% of the principal amount of any loan obtained
by or for the tenants in common; provided, however, no separate financing fee
will be paid with respect to the Pratt Loan Agreement. Any financing fee will be
payable to the Pratt Property Manager or its affiliate whether or not an outside
loan broker is used.

6.      In connection with any sale, exchange or other disposition of the Pratt
Building, or any portion thereof (including an undivided interest of a single
tenant in common), an amount equal to 2% of the sales price if the Pratt
Property Manager or its affiliates participates in the sale, exchange or other
disposition. If there is a broker fee paid to a third party broker in connection
with a sale, exchange or other disposition of the property, the payment to the
third party broker shall be paid out of the fee paid to the Pratt Property
Manager.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fees charged to the Registrant that
would be charged to the Registrant by its advisor or by its general property
manager, HPT Management Services LP, will exceed those that may be charged to
the Registrant by the Pratt Property Manager.

        Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC is the parent company of the
Registrant's advisor, Behringer Advisors LP. As of September 30, 2004, Robert
Behringer, the Registrant's President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of
the Board, owned approximately 56% of the limited liability company interests of
Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC and all of its voting interests. In addition,
Mr. Behringer is the sole manager of Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC.

ITEM 2.03   CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN
            OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

        The Registrant entered into the Pratt Loan Agreement on December 17,
2004. The total borrowings of all tenant in common interest holders under the
Pratt Loan Agreement was $37,000,000, including the $18,751,582 borrowed by the
Registrant. The interest rate under the loan is fixed at 5.285% per annum, and
repayment in whole (but not in part) is permitted from and after the third
payment date prior to the maturity date, provided that at least fifteen days
prior written notice is given. The Pratt Loan Agreement has a ten-year term.

        Under the Pratt Loan Agreement, each tenant in common interest holder's
liability is joint and several based upon its pro rata ownership of the Pratt
Building, though non-recourse provisions provide that the Pratt Lender may not
levy or execute judgment upon any property of the borrowers or their guarantors
other than the Pratt Building, except that each borrower and its guarantors are
liable for losses incurred by the Pratt Lender attributable to (i) such parties'
fraud or intentional misrepresentation; (ii) such borrower's removal or disposal
of any portion of the Property after an Event of Default; (iii) such borrower's
failure to obtain the Pratt Lender's prior written consent to any subordinate
financing or other voluntary lien encumbering such borrower's interest in the
Pratt Building; (iv) such borrower's failure to obtain the Pratt Lender's prior
written consent to any assignment, transfer or conveyance of such borrower's
interest in the Pratt Building or any portion thereof as required by the Pratt
Loan Agreement; (v) such borrower's violation of any of the special purpose
entity covenants and requirements contained in the Pratt Loan Agreement or the
related loan documents; (vi) the breach by such borrower of any representation,
warranty, covenant or indemnification provision in the Pratt Loan Agreement or
the related Deed of Trust concerning environmental laws, hazardous substances
and asbestos and

                                       6
<PAGE>

any indemnification of the Pratt Lender with respect thereto in either document;
provided, however, that such borrower's guarantor will not be liable for these
losses unless (A) in the event of a breach of any environmental representation,
the breach involved such borrower's or guarantor's actual knowledge of the
incorrectness or untruth of the underlying representation, and (B) in the event
of any breached warranty, covenant or indemnification, the breach was caused, in
whole or in part, by the actions of either such borrower or guarantor; (viii)
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such borrower; and (ix) any
election by such borrower to terminate or not to renew the Property Management
Agreement.

        In addition, each borrower under the Pratt Loan Agreement must protect,
defend, indemnify, release and hold the Pratt Lender harmless from and against
any and all losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against the Pratt
Lender up to an amount equal to such borrower's undivided interest in the Pratt
Building multiplied by the amount of the outstanding debt under the Pratt Loan
Agreement and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way relating to
any one or more of the following: (i) such borrower's failure to obtain the
Pratt Lender's prior written consent to any subordinate financing or other
voluntary lien encumbering the Pratt Building; (ii) such borrower's failure to
obtain the Pratt Lender's prior written consent to any assignment, transfer, or
conveyance of the Pratt Building as required by the Pratt Loan Agreement; and
(iii) such borrower's agreement to terminate the Pratt Tenants In Common
Agreement among the tenant in common owners of the Pratt Building without the
Pratt Lender's consent.

        In addition, each borrower's guarantor under the Pratt Loan is liable
for full payment of the outstanding debt thereunder up to an amount equal to
such borrower's undivided interest in the Pratt Building multiplied by the
amount of such outstanding debt in the event (i) that such borrower files a
voluntary petition under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other federal or state
bankruptcy or insolvency law, or (ii) an involuntary case is commenced against
such borrower under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other federal or state
bankruptcy or insolvency law with the collusion of such borrower or any of its
affiliates.

        In addition, Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC and Robert M. Behringer are
responsible for losses of the Pratt Lender relating to: (i) fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC or any of its affiliates in
connection with the Pratt Loan Agreement; (ii) the removal or disposal of any
portion of the Pratt Building after an event of default by Behringer Harvard
Pratt H, LLC or any of its affiliates; (iii) the failure of Behringer Harvard
Pratt H, LLC to obtain the Pratt Lender's prior written consent to any
subordinate financing or other voluntary lien encumbering the Pratt Building
that is placed thereon by Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC; (iv) the failure of
Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC to obtain the Pratt Lender's prior written
consent to any assignment, transfer or conveyance of the Pratt Building or any
portion thereof by Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC as required by the Pratt Loan
Agreement; (v) the breach by Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC of any
representation, warranty, covenant or indemnification provision in the Pratt
Loan Agreement or the related Deed of Trust concerning environmental laws,
hazardous substances and asbestos and any indemnification of the Pratt Lender
with respect thereto in either document; (vi) the filing by Behringer Harvard
Pratt H, LLC of any action for partition of the Pratt Building; (vii) any
election by Behringer Harvard Pratt H, LLC to terminate or not to renew the
Pratt Property Management Agreement in a manner not permitted under the Pratt
Loan Agreement; (viii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Behringer
Harvard Pratt H, LLC; and (ix) the misapplication or conversion by Behringer
Harvard Pratt H, LLC of (A) any insurance proceeds paid by reason of any loss,
damage or destruction to the Pratt Building, (B) any awards or other amounts
received in connection with the condemnation of all or a portion of the Pratt
Building, or (C) any rents following an event of default.

                                       7
<PAGE>

        In addition, Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC and Robert M. Behringer
have guaranteed payment of the debt under the Pratt Loan Agreement in the event

words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular

provision, (iii) all definitions are equally applicable to the singular and

but not limited to," and (v) accounting terms not specifically defined herein
shall be construed in accordance with GAAP.

2.      GENERAL LOAN TERMS

        2.1     THE LOAN. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Lender agrees to make a loan to Borrowers (the "LOAN") in the maximum
principal amount of up to $37,000,000 (the "PRINCIPAL"). The Loan shall mature
on the Stated Maturity Date. Each Borrower acknowledges receipt of the
Principal, the proceeds of which are being and shall be used to (i) acquire the
Property, (ii) fund certain of the Subaccounts and (iii) pay transaction costs.
Any excess proceeds may be used for any lawful purpose. No amount repaid in
respect of the Loan may be reborrowed.

        2.2     INTEREST; MONTHLY PAYMENTS.

                2.2.1   GENERALLY. From and after the date hereof, interest on
the unpaid Principal shall accrue at the Interest Rate and be payable as
hereinafter provided. On the date hereof, Borrowers shall pay interest on the
unpaid Principal from the date hereof through and including January 10, 2005. On
February 11, 2005 and each Payment Date thereafter through and including the
Payment Date immediately preceding the Amortization Commencement Date, Borrowers
shall pay interest on the unpaid Principal accrued at the Interest Rate during
the Interest Period immediately preceding such Payment Date (the "MONTHLY
INTEREST PAYMENT AMOUNT"). On the Amortization Commencement Date and each
Payment Date thereafter through and including December 11, 2014 (as such date
may be changed in accordance with Section 2.2.4), the Principal and interest
thereon at the Interest Rate shall be payable in equal monthly installments of
$205,118.20 (the "MONTHLY DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT AMOUNT"); which is based on the
Interest Rate and a 360-month amortization schedule. The Monthly Debt Service
Payment Amount due on any Payment Date shall first be applied to the payment of
interest accrued during the preceding Interest Period and the remainder of such
Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount shall be applied to the reduction of the
unpaid Principal. All accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable on
the Maturity Date. If the Loan is repaid on any date other than on a Payment
Date (whether prior to or after the Stated Maturity Date), Borrowers shall also
pay interest that would have accrued on such repaid Principal to but not
including the next Payment Date.

                2.2.2   DEFAULT RATE. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the entire unpaid Debt shall bear interest
at the Default Rate, and shall be payable upon demand from time to time, to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

                2.2.3   TAXES. Any and all payments by Borrowers hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding
taxes imposed on Lender's income, and franchise taxes imposed on Lender by the
law or regulation of any Governmental Authority (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to in this Section 2.2.3 as "APPLICABLE TAXES"). If any
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any

                                       14
<PAGE>

Applicable Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to Lender, the
following shall apply: (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.2.3), Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable law. Payments pursuant to this Section
2.2.3 shall be made within ten days after the date Lender makes written demand
therefor. If the amounts payable hereunder relate to Applicable Taxes which are
not of general application to lending institutions making secured mortgage loans
at such time, Borrowers shall have the option to prepay the Loan in full without
any Yield Maintenance Premium unless Lender, at its option, elects not to
require Borrower to pay such Applicable Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.2.3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Loan is transferred to a transferee which
is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of
America or any state thereof, the transferor shall cause such transferee,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to furnish to the
transferor and Borrowers either a United States Internal Revenue Service Form
4224 or United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such
transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from United States federal
withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder); provided, however, that in
the event that the transferor fails to cause the transferee to furnish either
such Form, Borrowers shall deduct any Applicable Taxes to the extent required by
law and payments shall be made net of any Applicable Taxes without regard to the
provisions of clause (i) of the second sentence of this Section 2.2.3.

                2.2.4   NEW PAYMENT DATE. Lender shall have the right, to be
exercised not more than once during the term of the Loan, to change the Payment
Date to a date other than the eleventh day of each month (a "NEW PAYMENT DATE"),
on 30 days' written notice to Borrowers; provided, however, that any such change
in the Payment Date: (i) shall not modify the amount of regularly scheduled
monthly principal and interest payments, except that the first payment of
principal and interest payable on the New Payment Date shall be accompanied by
interest at the interest rate herein provided for the period from the Payment
Date in the month in which the New Payment Date first occurs to the New Payment
Date, (ii) shall extend the Amortization Commencement Date to the New Payment
Date occurring in the month set forth in the definition of Amortization
Commencement Date, and (iii) shall extend the Stated Maturity Date to the New
Payment Date occurring in the month set forth in the definition of Stated
Maturity Date.

        2.3     LOAN REPAYMENT.

                2.3.1   REPAYMENT. Borrowers shall repay the entire outstanding
principal balance of the Note in full on the Maturity Date, together with
interest thereon to (but excluding) the date of repayment and any other amounts
due and owing under the Loan Documents. Borrowers shall have no right to prepay
or defease all or any portion of the Principal except in accordance with Section
2.3.2, Section 2.3.3 and Section 2.4 below. Except during the continuance of an
Event of Default, all proceeds of any repayment, including any prepayments of
the Loan, shall be applied by Lender as follows in the following order of
priority: FIRST, accrued and unpaid interest at the Interest Rate; SECOND, to
Principal; and THIRD, to any other amounts then due and owing under the Loan
Documents. If prior to the Stated Maturity Date the Debt is accelerated by
reason of an Event of Default, then Lender shall be entitled to receive, in

                                       15
<PAGE>

addition to the unpaid Principal and accrued interest and other sums due under
the Loan Documents, an amount equal to the Yield Maintenance Premium applicable
to such Principal so accelerated. During the continuance of an Event of Default,
all proceeds of repayment, including any payment or recovery on the Property
(whether through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise) shall,
unless otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, be applied in such order and in
such manner as Lender shall elect in Lender's discretion.

                2.3.2   MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. The Loan is subject to mandatory
prepayment in certain instances of Insured Casualty or Condemnation (each a
"CASUALTY/CONDEMNATION PREPAYMENT"), in the manner and to the extent set forth
in Section 7.4.2. Each Casualty/Condemnation Prepayment, after deducting
Lender's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
in connection with the settlement or collection of the Proceeds or Award, shall
be applied in the same manner as repayments under Section 2.3.1, and if such
Casualty/Condemnation Payment is made on any date other than a Payment Date,
then such Casualty/Condemnation Payment shall include interest that would have
accrued on the Principal prepaid to but not including the next Payment Date.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing, any such mandatory prepayment
under this Section 2.3.2 shall be without the payment of the Yield Maintenance
Premium. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each
Casualty/Condemnation Prepayment shall be applied in inverse order of maturity
and shall not extend or postpone the due dates of the monthly installments due
under the Note or this Agreement, or change the amounts of such installments.

                2.3.3   DEFEASANCE.

                (A)     CONDITIONS TO DEFEASANCE. Provided no Event of Default
shall be continuing, Borrowers shall have the right on any Payment Date after
the Release Date and prior to the Permitted Prepayment Date to voluntarily
defease the entire amount of the Principal and obtain a release of the Lien of
the Mortgage by providing Lender with the Defeasance Collateral (a "DEFEASANCE
EVENT"), subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

                (1)     Borrowers shall give Lender not less than thirty (30)
        days prior written notice specifying a Payment Date (the "DEFEASANCE
        DATE") on which the Defeasance Event is to occur.

                (2)     Borrowers shall pay to Lender (A) all payments of
        Principal and interest due on the Loan to and including the Defeasance
        Date and (B) all other sums, then due under the Note, this Agreement and
        the other Loan Documents;

                (3)     Borrowers shall deposit the Defeasance Collateral into
        the Defeasance Collateral Account and otherwise comply with the
        provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.3.3;

                (4)     Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Lender a Security
        Agreement in respect of the Defeasance Collateral Account and the
        Defeasance Collateral;

                (5)     Borrowers shall deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel
        for Borrowers that is standard in commercial lending transactions and
        subject only to customary qualifications, assumptions and exceptions
        opining, among other things, that (i) Lender has a legal and

                                       16
<PAGE>

        valid perfected first priority security interest in the Defeasance
        Collateral Account and the Defeasance Collateral, (ii) if a
        securitization has occurred, the REMIC Trust formed pursuant to such
        securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a "real estate
        mortgage investment conduit" within the meaning of Section 860D of the
        Code as a result of a Defeasance Event pursuant to this Section 2.3.3,
        (iii) the Defeasance Event will not result in a deemed exchange for
        purposes of the Code and will not adversely affect the status of the
        Note as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes, (iv) delivery of
        the Defeasance Collateral and the grant of a security interest therein
        to Lender shall not constitute an avoidable preference under Section 547
        of the Bankruptcy Code or applicable state law and (v) a
        non-consolidation opinion with respect to the Successor Borrower;

                (6)     Borrowers shall deliver to Lender a Rating Comfort
        Letter as to the Defeasance Event;

                (7)     Borrowers shall deliver an Officer's Certificate
        certifying that the requirements set forth in this Section 2.3.3 have
        been satisfied;

                (8)     Borrowers shall deliver a certificate of a "big four" or
        other nationally recognized public accounting firm acceptable to Lender
        certifying that the Defeasance Collateral will generate monthly amounts
        equal to or greater than the Scheduled Defeasance Payments;

                (9)     Borrowers shall deliver such other certificates,
        opinions, documents and instruments as Lender may reasonably request;
        and

                (10)    Borrowers shall pay all costs and expenses of Lender
        incurred in connection with the Defeasance Event, including Lender's
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and Rating Agency fees and
        expenses.

                (B)     DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. On or before the date on
which Borrowers deliver the Defeasance Collateral, Borrowers shall open at any
Eligible Institution the defeasance collateral account (the "DEFEASANCE
COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") which shall at all times be an Eligible Account. The
Defeasance Collateral Account shall contain only (i) Defeasance Collateral, and
(ii) cash from interest and principal paid on the Defeasance Collateral. All
cash from interest and principal payments paid on the Defeasance Collateral
shall be paid over to Lender on each Payment Date and applied first to accrued
and unpaid interest and then to Principal. Any cash from interest and principal
paid on the Defeasance Collateral not needed to pay accrued and unpaid interest
or Principal shall be retained in the Defeasance Collateral Account as
additional collateral for the Loan. Borrowers shall cause the Eligible
Institution at which the Defeasance Collateral is deposited to enter an
agreement with Borrowers and Lender, satisfactory to Lender in its sole
discretion, pursuant to which such Eligible Institution shall agree to hold and
distribute the Defeasance Collateral in accordance with this Agreement. The
Successor Borrower shall be the owner of the Defeasance Collateral Account and
shall report all income accrued on Defeasance Collateral for federal, state and
local income tax purposes in its income tax return. Borrowers shall prepay all
cost and expenses associated with opening and maintaining the

                                       17
<PAGE>

Defeasance Collateral Account. Lender shall not in any way be liable by reason
of any insufficiency in the Defeasance Collateral Account.

                (C)     SUCCESSOR BORROWER. In connection with a Defeasance
Event under this Section 2.3.3, Borrowers shall, if required by the Rating
Agencies or if Borrowers elect to do so, establish or designate a successor
entity (the "SUCCESSOR BORROWER") which shall be a Single Purpose Bankruptcy
Remote Entity and which shall be approved by the Rating Agencies. Any such
Successor Borrower may, at Borrowers' option, be an Affiliate of Borrowers
unless the Rating Agencies shall require otherwise. Borrowers shall transfer and
assign all obligations, rights and duties under and to the Note, together with
the Defeasance Collateral to such Successor Borrower. Such Successor Borrower
shall assume the obligations under the Note and the Security Agreement and
Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations under such documents. Borrowers
shall pay a minimum of $1,000 to any such Successor Borrower as consideration
for assuming the obligations under the Note and the Security Agreement.
Borrowers shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender, including
Lender's attorney's fees and expenses, incurred in connection therewith.

                2.3.4   OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. From and after the third Payment
Date prior to the Stated Maturity Date (the "PERMITTED PREPAYMENT DATE"),
Borrowers shall have the right to prepay the Loan in whole (but not in part),
provided that Borrowers give Lender at least 15 days' prior written notice
thereof. If any such prepayment is not made on a Payment Date, Borrowers shall
also pay interest that would have accrued on such prepaid Principal to, but not
including, the next Payment Date. Any such prepayment shall be made without
payment of the Yield Maintenance Premium.

        2.4     RELEASE OF PROPERTY.

                2.4.1   RELEASE ON DEFEASANCE. If Borrowers have elected to
defease the Note and the requirements of Section 2.3.3 and this Section 2.4 have
been satisfied, the Property shall be released from the Lien of the Mortgage and
the Defeasance Collateral pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement shall be
the sole source of collateral securing the Note. In connection with the release
of the Lien, Borrowers shall submit to Lender, not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the Defeasance Date (or such shorter time as is acceptable to Lender in
its sole discretion), a release of Lien (and related Loan Documents) for
execution by Lender. Such release shall be in a form appropriate in the
jurisdiction in which the Property is located and contain standard provisions
protecting the rights of the releasing lender. In addition, Borrowers shall
provide all other documentation Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by
Borrowers in connection with such release, together with an Officer's
Certificate certifying that such documentation (i) is in compliance with all
Legal Requirements, and (ii) will effect such release in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Borrower shall pay all costs, taxes and expenses
associated with the release of the Lien of the Mortgage, including Lender's
reasonable attorneys' fees.

                2.4.2   RELEASE ON PAYMENT IN FULL. Lender shall, upon the
written request and at the expense of Borrowers, upon payment in full of the
Debt in accordance herewith, release or, if requested by Borrowers, assign to
Borrowers' designee (without any representation or warranty by and without any
recourse against Lender whatsoever), the Lien of the Loan Documents if not
theretofore released.

                                       18
<PAGE>

        2.5     PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

                2.5.1   MAKING OF PAYMENTS. Each payment by a Borrower or
Borrowers shall be made in funds settled through the New York Clearing House
Interbank Payments System or other funds immediately available to Lender by
11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such payment is due, to Lender by
deposit to such account as Lender may designate by written notice to Borrowers.
Whenever any such payment shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the first Business Day thereafter.
All such payments shall be made irrespective of, and without any deduction,
set-off or counterclaim whatsoever and are payable without relief from valuation
and appraisement laws and with all costs and charges incurred in the collection
or enforcement thereof, including attorneys' fees and court costs.

                2.5.2   COMPUTATIONS. Interest payable under the Loan Documents
shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a
360-day year.

                2.5.3   LATE PAYMENT CHARGE. If any Principal, interest or other
sum due under any Loan Document is not paid by Borrowers on the date on which it
is due and, subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.5.3, such failure
continues for five (5) days, Borrowers shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount
equal to the lesser of 5% of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by
applicable law (the "LATE PAYMENT CHARGE"), in order to defray the expense
incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent payment and to
compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment. Such
amount shall be secured by the Loan Documents. With respect to the foregoing 5
day grace period, the parties agree that such 5 day grace period shall only be
applicable no more than twice during the Term, and in all other instances, the
Late Payment Charge shall be payable in accordance with this Section 2.5.3 with
respect to any Principal, interest or other sum due under any Loan Document
which is not paid by Borrowers on the date on which the same is due.

3.      CASH MANAGEMENT AND RESERVES

        3.1     CASH MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS. Borrowers shall cause all Rents to
be transmitted directly by tenants of the Property into a trust account (the
"CLEARING ACCOUNT") maintained by Borrower at a local bank selected by such
Borrower, which shall at all times be an Eligible Institution (the "CLEARING
BANK") as more fully described in the Clearing Account Agreement. Without in any
way limiting the foregoing, all Rents received by Borrowers or Manager shall be
deposited into the Clearing Account within two Business Days of receipt. Funds
deposited into the Clearing Account shall be swept by the Clearing Bank on a
daily basis into an Eligible Account at the Deposit Bank controlled by Lender
(the "DEPOSIT ACCOUNT") and applied and disbursed in accordance with this
Agreement. Funds in the Deposit Account shall be invested at Lender's discretion
only in Permitted Investments. Lender will also establish subaccounts of the
Deposit Account which shall at all times be Eligible Accounts (and may be ledger
or book entry accounts and not actual accounts) (such subaccounts are referred
to herein as "Subaccounts"). The Deposit Account and any Subaccount will be
under the sole control and dominion of Lender, and no Borrower shall have any
right of withdrawal therefrom. Borrowers shall pay for all expenses of opening
and maintaining all of the above accounts.

                                       19
<PAGE>

        3.2     REQUIRED REPAIRS; 3.2.1 COMPLETION OF REQUIRED REPAIRS.
Borrowers shall perform and complete each item of the repairs and environmental
remedial work at the Property described on Schedule 2 (the "REQUIRED Repairs")
within six (6) months of the date hereof or such shorter period of time for such
item set forth on Schedule 2.

                3.2.2   REQUIRED REPAIRS RESERVES. On the date hereof, Borrowers
shall deposit with Lender $14,637.50 and Lender shall cause such amount to be
transferred to a Subaccount (the "REQUIRED REPAIRS SUBACCOUNT"). Provided no
Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, Lender shall disburse
funds held in the Required Repairs Subaccount to Borrowers (or at Borrower's
direction, disburse directly to the payee of the subject Required Repairs (or
portion thereof)), within 10 days after the delivery by Borrowers to Lender of a
request therefor (but not more often than once per month), in increments of at
least $5,000, accompanied by the following items (which items shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to Lender): (i) an Officer's Certificate (A)
certifying that the Required Repairs or any portion thereof which are the
subject of the requested disbursement have been completed in a good and
workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements, (B)
identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in connection with such
Required Repairs or any portion thereof and (C) stating that each such Person
has been or, upon receipt of the requested disbursement, will be paid in full
with respect to the portion of the Required Repairs which is the subject of the
requested disbursement; (ii) copies of appropriate Lien waivers or other
evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender; (iii) with respect to any
disbursement that exceeds $50,000, at Lender's option, a title search for the
Property indicating that it is free from all Liens not previously approved by
Lender; (iv) a copy of each License required to be obtained with respect to the
portion of the Required Repairs which is the subject of the requested
disbursement; and (v) such other evidence as Lender shall reasonably request
that the Required Repairs which are the subject of the requested disbursement
have been completed and paid for. Provided no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and is continuing, upon Borrowers' completion of all Required
Repairs in accordance with this Section 3.2, Lender shall release any funds
remaining in the Required Repairs Subaccount, if any, to Borrowers.

        3.3     TAXES AND INSURANCE. Borrowers shall pay to Lender on each
Payment Date (i) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender estimates will be payable
during the next 12 months in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such Taxes at least 30 days prior to their respective due dates and (ii)
one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance
Premiums at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the Policies. Such amounts
will be transferred by Lender to a Subaccount (the "TAX AND INSURANCE
SUBACCOUNT"). Provided that no monetary Event of Default or material
non-monetary Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender will (a)
apply funds in the Tax and Insurance Subaccount to payments of Taxes and
Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrowers pursuant to Sections 5.2 and
7.1, provided that Borrowers have promptly supplied Lender with notices of all
Taxes and Insurance Premiums due, or (b) reimburse Borrowers for such amounts
upon presentation of evidence of payment; subject, however, to Borrowers' right
to contest Taxes in accordance with Section 5.2. In making any payment relating
to Taxes and Insurance Premiums, Lender may do so according to any bill,
statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect
to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without
inquiry into the

                                       20
<PAGE>

accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax,
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If Lender
determines in its reasonable judgment that the funds in the Tax and Insurance
Subaccount will be insufficient to pay (or in excess of) the Taxes or Insurance
Premiums next coming due, Lender may increase (or decrease) the monthly
contribution required to be made by Borrowers to the Tax and Insurance
Subaccount.

        3.4     CAPITAL EXPENSE RESERVES; 3.4.1 CAPITAL RESERVE SUBACCOUNT. On
the date hereof, Borrowers shall deposit with Lender $0 and Lender shall
transfer such amounts into a Subaccount (the "CAPITAL RESERVE Subaccount"). On
the Payment Date occurring in January 11, 2004, and each Payment Date
thereafter, Borrowers shall pay to Lender $5,938.68 per month. Lender will
transfer such amounts into the Capital Reserve Subaccount. Additionally, upon
thirty (30) days' prior notice to Borrowers, Lender may reassess the amount of
the monthly payment required under this Section 3.4 from time to time in its
reasonable discretion (based upon its then current underwriting standards).
Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
disburse funds held in the Capital Reserve Subaccount and, if funds available in
the Capital Reserve Subaccount are not sufficient to pay for the requested
disbursement, the Debt Service Subaccount (it being understood and agreed that
if funds are available in the Capital Reserve Subaccount, such funds shall be
used for Approved Capital Expenses prior to disbursements from the Debt Service
Subaccount) to Borrowers, within 15 days after the delivery by Borrowers to
Lender of a request therefor (but not more often than once per month), in
increments of at least $5,000 provided that (i) such disbursement is for an
Approved Capital Expense; (ii) Lender shall have (if it desires) verified (by an
inspection conducted at Borrowers' expense (with respect to any disbursement in
excess of $50,000)) performance of the work associated with such Approved
Capital Expense; and (iii) the request for disbursement is accompanied by (A) an
Officer's Certificate certifying (1) that such funds will be used to pay or
reimburse Borrowers for Approved Capital Expenses and a description thereof, (2)
that all outstanding trade payables (other than those not yet due and payable or
those to be paid from the requested disbursement or those constituting Permitted
Indebtedness) have been paid in full, (3) that the same has not been the subject
of a previous disbursement, and (4) that all previous disbursements have been
used to pay the previously identified Approved Capital Expenses, and (B) lien
waivers or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender, (C) with respect to
any disbursement that exceeds $50,000, at Lender's option, a title search for
the Property indicating that the Property is free from all Liens, claims and
other encumbrances not previously approved by Lender and (D) such other evidence
as Lender shall reasonably request that the Approved Capital Expenditures at the
Property to be funded by the requested disbursement have been completed and are
paid for or will be paid upon such disbursement to Borrowers. Any such
disbursement of more than $10,000 to pay (rather than reimburse) Approved
Capital Expenses may, at Lender's option, be made by joint check payable to
Borrowers and the payee on such Approved Capital Expenses.

        3.5     ROLLOVER RESERVES..

                3.5.1   GENERAL ROLLOVER RESERVE. On the date hereof, Borrowers
shall deposit with Lender $5,250,000.00 and Lender shall transfer such amount
into a Subaccount (the "ROLLOVER RESERVE SUBACCOUNT"). On the Payment Date
occurring in January 11, 2004, and each Payment Date thereafter, Borrowers shall
pay to Lender a monthly amount determined as follows: $24,744.15 per month for
each Payment Date in calendar year 2005; $34,642.68 per

                                       21
<PAGE>

month for each Payment Date in calendar year 2006; $24,744.15 per month for each
Payment Date in calendar year 2007; $9,402.73 per month for each Payment Date in
calendar year 2008; $40,085.57 per month for each Payment Date in calendar year
2009; $44,540.13 per month for each Payment Date in calendar year 2010; and
$29,693.42 per month for each Payment Date in calendar year 2011 and in each
calendar year thereafter. Lender will transfer such amounts into the Rollover
Reserve Subaccount. Borrowers shall pay to Lender for transfer into the Rollover
Reserve Subaccount all payments received from tenants in connection with the
early termination or cancellation of any Leases, including fees, penalties and
commissions. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Lender shall disburse funds held in the Rollover Reserve Subaccount and, if
funds available in the Rollover Reserve Subaccount are not sufficient to pay for
the requested disbursement, the Debt Service Subaccount (it being understood and
agreed that if funds are available in the Rollover Reserve Subaccount, such
funds shall be used for Approved Leasing Expenses prior to disbursements from
the Debt Service Subaccount) to Borrowers, within 15 days after the delivery by
Borrowers to Lender of a request therefor (but not more often than once per
month), in increments of at least $5,000, provided (i) such disbursement is for
an Approved Leasing Expense; (ii) Lender shall have (if it desires) verified (by
an inspection conducted at Borrowers' expense) performance of any construction
work associated with such Approved Leasing Expense; and (iii) the request for
disbursement is accompanied by (A) an Officer's Certificate certifying (1) that
such funds will be used only to pay (or reimburse Borrowers for) Approved
Leasing Expenses and a description thereof, (2) that all outstanding trade
payables (other than those not yet due and payable or those to be paid from the
requested disbursement or those constituting Permitted Indebtedness) have been
paid in full, (3) that the same has not been the subject of a previous
disbursement, and (4) that all previous disbursements have been used only to pay
(or reimburse Borrowers for) the previously identified Approved Leasing
Expenses, and (B) reasonably detailed supporting documentation as to the amount,
necessity and purpose therefor. Any such disbursement of more than $10,000 to
pay (rather than reimburse) Approved Leasing Expenses may, at Lender's option,
be made by joint check payable to Borrowers and the payee of such Approved
Leasing Expenses.

        3.6     OPERATING EXPENSE SUBACCOUNT On each Payment Date during the
continuance of a Cash Trap Period, a portion of Rents that have been deposited
into the Deposit Account during the immediately preceding Interest Period in an
amount equal to the monthly amount set forth in the Approved Operating Budget
for the following month (plus any other amounts requested by Borrowers for such
month for payment of items constituting Approved Operating Expenses, which are
not included in the Approved Operating Budget), shall be transferred into a
Subaccount for the purpose of payment of Approved Operating Expenses for the
month in which such Payment Date occurs (the "OPERATING EXPENSE SUBACCOUNT").
Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
disburse funds held in the Operating Expense Subaccount to Borrowers (or at
Borrowers' direction, to the Manager), within 5 Business Days after delivery by
Borrowers to Lender of a request therefor (but not more often than weekly), in
increments of at least $1,000, provided (i) such disbursement is for an Approved
Operating Expense; and (ii) such disbursement is accompanied by (A) an Officer's
Certificate certifying (1) that such funds will be used to pay Approved
Operating Expenses and a description thereof, (2) that all outstanding trade
payables (other than those not yet due and payable or those to be paid from the
requested disbursement or those constituting Permitted Indebtedness) have been
paid in full, (3) that the same has not been the subject of a previous
disbursement, and (4) that all previous disbursements have been or will be used
to pay the

                                       22
<PAGE>

previously identified Approved Operating Expenses, and (B) reasonably detailed
documentation satisfactory to Lender as to the amount, necessity and purpose
therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the
extent that (i) Borrower has requested a disbursement of funds from the
Operating Expense Subaccount in accordance with the foregoing provisions and
(ii) at the time of such request, the funds that have been collected in the
Operating Expense Subaccount are insufficient to cover the same, then Lender
shall nonetheless disburse additional funds that are thereafter deposited into
the Operating Expense Subaccount to Borrower (without any requirement for
Borrower to submit an additional request therefor); provided that sufficient
funds have been collected in the Deposit Account to make the payments required
under clauses (i) - (vi) of Section 3.11(a) on the next succeeding Payment Date.

        3.7     CASUALTY/CONDEMNATION SUBACCOUNT. Borrowers shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Lender all Proceeds or Awards due to any Casualty or Condemnation
to be transferred to a Subaccount (the "CASUALTY/CONDEMNATION SUBACCOUNT") in
accordance with the provisions of Section 7. All amounts in the
Casualty/Condemnation Subaccount shall disbursed in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7.

        3.8     SECURITY DEPOSITS. Borrowers shall keep all security deposits
under Leases in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. After the
occurrence of an Event of Default, Borrowers shall, upon Lender's request, if
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, turn over to Lender the security
deposits (and any interest theretofore earned thereon) under Leases, to be held
by Lender in a Subaccount (the "SECURITY DEPOSIT SUBACCOUNT") subject to the
terms of the Leases. Security deposits held in the Security Deposit Subaccount
will be released by Lender upon notice from Borrowers together with such
evidence as Lender may reasonably request that such security deposit is required
to be returned to a tenant pursuant to the terms of a Lease or may be applied as
Rent pursuant to the rights of Borrower under the applicable Lease. Any letter
of credit or other instrument that any Borrower receives in lieu of a cash
security deposit under any Lease shall (i) be maintained in full force and
effect in the full amount unless replaced by a cash deposit as hereinabove
described and (ii) if permitted pursuant to any Legal Requirements, name Lender
as payee or mortgagee thereunder (or at Lender's option, be fully assignable to
Lender).

        3.9     CASH COLLATERAL SUBACCOUNT. If a Cash Trap Period shall have
commenced, then on the immediately succeeding Payment Date and on each Payment
Date thereafter during the continuance of such Cash Trap Period, all Available
Cash shall be paid to Lender, which amounts shall be transferred by Lender into
a Subaccount (the "CASH COLLATERAL SUBACCOUNT") as cash collateral for the Debt.
Any funds in the Cash Collateral Account and not previously disbursed or applied
shall be disbursed to Borrowers upon the termination of such Cash Trap Period.
Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time during the
continuance of a monetary Event of Default or material non-monetary Event of
Default, in its sole and absolute discretion to apply all sums then on deposit
in the Cash Collateral Subaccount to the Debt, in such order and in such manner
as Lender shall elect in its sole and absolute discretion, including to make a
prepayment of Principal (together with the applicable Yield Maintenance Premium
applicable thereto). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above,
Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to allocate any funds that have been deposited into the Cash
Collateral Subaccount as a result of a Cash Trap Period

                                       23
<PAGE>

described in clause (ii) of the defined term "Cash Trap Period", into the
Rollover Reserve Subaccount to be applied in accordance with the terms and
conditions of SECTION 3.5 hereof.

        3.10    GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST; APPLICATION OF FUNDS. As security
for payment of the Debt and the performance by Borrowers of all other terms,
conditions and provisions of the Loan Documents, each Borrower hereby pledges
and assigns to Lender, and grants to Lender a security interest in, all such
Borrower's right, title and interest in and to all Rents and in and to all
payments to or monies held in the Clearing Account, the Deposit Account, all
Subaccounts created pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the "CASH
MANAGEMENT Accounts"). Each Borrower hereby grants to Lender a continuing
security interest in, and agrees to hold in trust for the benefit of Lender, all
Rents in its possession prior to the (i) payment of such Rents to Lender or (ii)
deposit of such Rents into the Deposit Account. No Borrower shall, without
obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant
any security interest in any Cash Management Account, or permit any Lien to
attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements,
except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect
thereto. This Agreement is, among other things, intended by the parties to be a
security agreement for purposes of the UCC. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may apply any sums in any Cash
Management Account in any order and in any manner as Lender shall elect in
Lender's discretion without seeking the appointment of a receiver and without
adversely affecting the rights of Lender to foreclose the Lien of the Mortgage
or exercise its other rights under the Loan Documents. Cash Management Accounts
shall not constitute trust funds and may be commingled with other monies held by
Lender. All interest which accrues on the funds in any Cash Management Account
(other than the Tax and Insurance Subaccount) shall accrue for the benefit of
Borrowers and shall be taxable to Borrowers and shall be added to and disbursed
in the same manner and under the same conditions as the principal sum on which
said interest accrued. Upon repayment in full of the Debt, all remaining funds
in the Subaccounts, if any, shall be promptly disbursed to Borrowers.

        3.11    PROPERTY CASH FLOW ALLOCATION. (a)All Rents deposited into the
Deposit Account during the immediately preceding Interest Period shall be
applied on each Payment Date as follows in the following order of priority: (i)
First, to make payments into the Tax and Insurance Subaccount as required under
Section 3.3; (ii) Second, to pay the monthly portion of the fees charged by the
Deposit Bank in accordance with the Deposit Account Agreement; (iii) Third, to
Lender to pay the Monthly Interest Payment Amount or the Monthly Debt Service
Payment Amount, as the case may be, due on such Payment Date (plus, if
applicable, interest at the Default Rate and all other amounts, other than those
described under other clauses of this Section 3.11(a), then due to Lender under
the Loan Documents); (iv) Fourth, to make payments into the Capital Reserve
Subaccount as and when required under Section 3.4; (v) Fifth, to make payments
into the Rollover Reserve Subaccount as and when required under Section 3.5;
(vi) Sixth to make payments into the Debt Service Subaccount as and when
required under Section 3.12, each in the amount of the then-applicable Monthly
Debt Service Reserve Deposit; (vii) Seventh, during the continuance of a Cash
Trap Period or Cash Sweep Period, to make payments for Approved Operating
Expenses as required under Section 3.6; (viii) Eighth, either (A) during the
continuance of a Cash Trap Period, to make payments in an amount equal to all
remaining Available Cash on such Payment Date into the Cash Collateral
Subaccount in accordance with Section 3.9, or (B) if a Cash Trap Period is not
in effect, but a Cash Sweep Period is in effect, to make payments in an amount
equal to all remaining Available Cash into the Debt Service

                                       24
<PAGE>

Subaccount (the "ACCRUED DEBT SERVICE RESERVE DEPOSITS") until such time as the
Accrued Debt Service Reserve Amount is reduced to zero; and (ix) Lastly, except
during the continuance of a Cash Trap Period, payments to Borrowers of any
remaining amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except during the continuance
of a Cash Trap Period, or Cash Sweep Period, provided that in any given Interest
Period, all amounts referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) - (vi) have been
paid, then at Borrowers' request, the payments to Borrowers under the foregoing
clause (ix) shall be made on a weekly basis.

                (b)     The failure of Borrowers to make all of the payments
required under clauses (i) through (viii) of Section 3.11(a) in full on each
Payment Date shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement;
provided, however, if adequate funds are available in the Deposit Account for
such payments, the failure by the Deposit Bank to allocate such funds into the
appropriate Subaccounts shall not constitute an Event of Default.

                (c)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 3.11, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may apply
all Rents deposited into the Deposit Account and other proceeds of repayment in
such order and in such manner as Lender shall elect.

        3.12    DEBT SERVICE RESERVE. On the Payment Date occurring in January
11, 2004, and each Payment Date thereafter, Borrowers shall pay to Lender a
monthly amount determined as follows: $0.00 per month for each Payment Date in
calendar year 2005; $66,808.55 per month for each Payment Date in calendar year
2006; $0.00 per month for each Payment Date in calendar year 2007; $0.00 per
month for each Payment Date in calendar year 2008; $0.00 per month for each
Payment Date in calendar year 2009; $26,228.28 per month for each Payment Date
in calendar year 2010; and $41,074.98 per month for each Payment Date in
calendar year 2011 and in each calendar year thereafter (each such required
payment, a "MONTHLY DEBT SERVICE RESERVE DEPOSIT") and Lender shall transfer
such amounts into a Subaccount (the "DEBT SERVICE SUBACCOUNT"). In the event
that remaining Available Cash on any Payment Date, after applications under
clauses (i) through (v) of Section 3.11 above, is not sufficient to make the
Monthly Debt Service Reserve Deposit and fund the amounts indicated in clause
(vii) of Section 3.11 above, and Borrower does not deposit the amount of such
insufficiency into the Deposit Account, then unless and until Lender declares an
Event of Default as a result thereof, and notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3.11 above, Available Cash, after applications under clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 3.11 above, shall be applied first in the amount indicated in
clause (vii) above and then to the Monthly Debt Service Reserve Deposit, a "CASH
SWEEP CONDITION" shall exist and the amount by which the Monthly Debt Service
Reserve Deposit is underfunded (together with any such underfunded amounts from
prior Payment Dates which have not yet been funded by Accrued Debt Service
Reserve Deposits, the "ACCRUED DEBT SERVICE RESERVE AMOUNT") shall be funded
from excess Available Cash on subsequent Payment Dates as provided in Section
3.11 above until the Accrued Debt Service Reserve Amount is reduced to zero, as
which time the Cash Sweep Condition shall no longer exist and the Cash Sweep
Period shall end, unless and until a subsequent deficiency occurs and is not
fully funded on the require Payment Date, in which event the foregoing
provisions shall again apply. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Lender shall disburse funds held in the Debt Service Subaccount
to Borrowers for Approved Capital Expenses subject and pursuant to Section 3.4
and for Approved Leasing Expenses subject and pursuant to Section 3.5, and also,
within 15 days after the delivery by Borrowers to Lender of a request therefor
(but not more often than

                                       25
<PAGE>

once per month), and provided funds available in the Deposit Account on a
Payment Date are not sufficient to pay the Monthly Interest Payment Amount or
Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount due on such Payment Date, to pay (to the
extent of any such insufficiency) such Monthly Interest Payment Amount or
Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount.

        3.13    INITIAL DEPOSITS INTO RESERVES. The initial deposits required to
be made on the date hereof into the reserve accounts established under this
Article 3 are funded from the proceeds of the Loan disbursed at closing.

        3.14    TENANT IMPROVEMENTS. On the date hereof, Borrowers shall deposit
with Lender $933,512.06; $531,581.96 of which shall be referred to as the "CB
FUNDS", $305,286.10 of which shall be referred to as the "MORGAN STANLEY FUNDS",
and $96,644.00 of which shall be referred to as the "PWC FUNDS" and Lender shall
transfer such amount into a Subaccount (the "TENANT IMPROVEMENT RESERVE
SUBACCOUNT"). The CB Funds shall be used to reimburse Borrowers and/or to pay,
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Borrowers in completing the tenant
improvements under Section 7 of the Fourth Amendment to the CB Lease. The Morgan
Stanley Funds shall be used to reimburse Borrowers and/or to pay, in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by Borrowers in completing the tenant improvements
under Section 6 of the Third Amendment to the Morgan Stanley Lease. The PWC
Funds shall be used to reimburse Borrowers and/or to pay, in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Borrowers in completing the tenant improvements under
Exhibit F Section 5(a)-(b) to the PWC Lease. Provided that no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall disburse funds held in the Tenant
Improvement Reserve Subaccount to Borrowers, within 15 days after the delivery
by Borrowers to Lender of a request therefor (but not more often than once per
month), in increments of at least $5,000, provided (i) such request includes
whether the request relates to tenant improvements under the CB Lease with
respect to CB Funds, the Morgan Stanley Lease with respect to the Morgan Stanley
Funds or the PWC Lease with respect to the PWC Funds; (ii) Borrowers shall
provide Lender with an original estoppel certificate executed by the applicable
tenant under the lease for which such request relates, stating that such tenant
has accepted the tenant improvements, and has occupied the space covered by the
tenant improvements, and that there are no defaults under such lease (nor does
there exist any event or condition, which with the passage of time or the giving
of notice, or both, could result in such a default); (iii) Lender shall have (if
it desires) verified (by an inspection conducted at Borrowers' expense)
performance of any construction work associated with such work; and (iv) the
request for disbursement is accompanied by (A) an Officer's Certificate
certifying (1) that such funds will be used only to pay (or reimburse Borrowers
for) tenant improvements under the CB Lease, Morgan Stanley Lease, or PWC Lease,
(2) that all outstanding trade payables (other than those not yet due and
payable or those to be paid from the requested disbursement or those
constituting Permitted Indebtedness) have been paid in full, and (3) that the
same has not been the subject of a previous disbursement, and (B) reasonably
detailed supporting documentation as to the amount, necessity and purpose
therefor. Any such disbursement of more than $10,000 to pay (rather than
reimburse) tenant improvements under this Section may, at Lender's option, be
made by joint check payable to Borrowers and the payee of such tenant
improvements.

4.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        Each Borrower represents and warrants to Lender as of the date hereof
that, except to the extent (if any) disclosed on Schedule 3 with reference to a
specific Section of this Article 4:

        4.1     ORGANIZATION; SPECIAL PURPOSE. Each Borrower has been duly
organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
state of its formation, with requisite power and authority, and all rights,
licenses, permits and authorizations, governmental or otherwise, necessary to
own its properties and to transact the business in which it is now engaged. Each
Borrower is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where it is required to be so qualified in connection with its
properties, business and operations. Each Borrower is a Special Purpose
Bankruptcy Remote Entity.

        4.2     PROCEEDINGS; ENFORCEABILITY. Each Borrower has taken all
necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the
Loan Documents. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each
Borrower that is a party to such Loan Document and constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally, and general
principles of equity. The Loan Documents are not subject to, and no Borrower has
asserted, any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including
the defense of usury. No exercise of any of the terms of the Loan Documents, or
any right thereunder, will render any Loan Document unenforceable.

        4.3     NO CONFLICTS. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Loan Documents by Borrowers and the transactions contemplated hereby will not
conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
(other than pursuant to the Loan Documents) upon any of the property of any
Borrower pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or instrument to which any
Borrower is a party or by which its property is subject, nor will such action
result in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over any Borrower
or any of its properties. No Borrower's rights under the Licenses and the
Management Agreement will be adversely affected by the execution and delivery of
the Loan Documents, any Borrower's performance thereunder, the recordation of
the Mortgage, or the exercise of any remedies by Lender. Any consent, approval,
authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any Governmental
Authority required for the execution, delivery and performance by any Borrower
of the Loan Documents has been obtained and is in full force and effect.

        4.4     LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or other proceedings at
law or in equity by or before any Governmental Authority now pending or
threatened against or affecting any Borrower, the Manager or the Property,
which, if adversely determined, might materially adversely affect the condition
(financial or otherwise) or business of any Borrower, Manager or the condition
or ownership of the Property.

                                       27
<PAGE>

        4.5     AGREEMENTS. No Borrower is a party to any agreement or
instrument or subject to any restriction which might adversely affect any
Borrower or the Property, or any Borrower's business, properties, operations or
condition, financial or otherwise. No Borrower is in default in any material
respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,
covenants or conditions contained in any Permitted Encumbrance or any other
agreement or instrument to which any Borrower is a party or by which any
Borrower or the Property is bound.

        4.6     TITLE. Borrowers have good, marketable and indefeasible title in
fee to the real property and good title to the balance of the Property, free and
clear of all Liens except the Permitted Encumbrances. All transfer taxes, deed
stamps, intangible taxes or other amounts in the nature of transfer taxes
required to be paid by any Person under applicable Legal Requirements in
connection with the transfer of the Property to Borrowers have been paid. The
Mortgage when properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with any
UCC Financing Statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will
create (i) a valid, perfected first priority lien on Borrowers' interest in the
Property and (ii) valid and perfected first priority security interests in and
to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the
Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case subject only to
any applicable Permitted Encumbrances. All mortgage, recording, stamp,
intangible or other similar taxes required to be paid by any Person under
applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the execution, delivery,
recordation, filing, registration, perfection or enforcement of any of the Loan
Documents have been paid. The Permitted Encumbrances do not materially adversely
affect the value, operation or use of the Property, or Borrowers' ability to
repay the Loan. No Condemnation or other proceeding has been commenced or, to
Borrowers' best knowledge, is contemplated with respect to all or part of the
Property or for the relocation of roadways providing access to the Property.
There are no claims for payment for work, labor or materials affecting the
Property which are or may become a Lien prior to, or of equal priority with, the
Liens created by the Loan Documents. There are no outstanding options to
purchase or rights of first refusal affecting all or any portion of the
Property. The survey for the Property delivered to Lender does not fail to
reflect any material matter affecting the Property or the title thereto. Except
as shown on the survey, all of the Improvements included in determining the
appraised value of the Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building
restriction lines of the Property, and no improvement on an adjoining property
encroaches upon the Property, and no easement or other encumbrance upon the
Property encroaches upon any of the Improvements, except those insured against
by the Title Insurance Policy. Each parcel comprising the Property is a separate
tax lot and is not a portion of any other tax lot that is not a part of the
Property. There are no pending or proposed special or other assessments for
public improvements or otherwise affecting the Property, or any contemplated
improvements to the Property that may result in such special or other
assessments.

        4.7     NO BANKRUPTCY FILING. No Borrower is contemplating either the
filing of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency
law or the liquidation of all or a major portion of its property (a "BANKRUPTCY
PROCEEDING"), and Borrowers have no knowledge of any Person contemplating the
filing of any such petition against any Borrower. In addition, no Borrower nor
any principal nor Affiliate of any Borrower has been a party to, or the subject
of a Bankruptcy Proceeding for the past ten years.

        4.8     FULL AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE. No statement of fact made by any
Borrower in any Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements contained
therein not misleading. There is no material fact presently known to any
Borrower that has not been disclosed to Lender which adversely affects, or, as
far as any Borrower can foresee, might adversely affect, the Property or the
business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower. All
financial data, including the statements of cash flow and income and operating
expense, that have been delivered to Lender in respect of Borrowers and, to
Borrowers' knowledge, the Property (i) are true, complete and correct in all
material respects, (ii) accurately represent the financial condition of each
Borrower and the Property as of the date of such reports, and (iii) to the
extent prepared by an independent certified public accounting firm, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods
covered, except as disclosed therein. No Borrower has any contingent
liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments,
unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments or any
liabilities or obligations not expressly permitted by this Agreement. Since the
date of such financial statements, there has been no materially adverse change
in the financial condition, operations or business of any Borrower or the
Property from that set forth in said financial statements.

        4.9     TAX FILINGS. To the extent required, each Borrower has filed (or
has obtained effective extensions for filing) all federal, state and local tax
returns required to be filed and have paid or made adequate provision for the
payment of all federal, state and local taxes, charges and assessments payable
by such Borrower. Each Borrower believes that its tax returns (if any) properly
reflect the income and taxes of such Borrower for the periods covered thereby,
subject only to reasonable adjustments required by the Internal Revenue Service
or other applicable tax authority upon audit.

        4.10    NO PLAN ASSETS. As of the date hereof and throughout the Term
(i) no Borrower is or will be an "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) none of the assets of any
Borrower constitutes or will constitute "plan assets" of one or more such plans
within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, (iii) no Borrower is or will
be a "governmental plan" within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA, and (iv)
transactions by or with any Borrower are not and will not be subject to state
statutes regulating investment of, and fiduciary obligations with respect to,
governmental plans. As of the date hereof, no Borrower, nor any member of a
"controlled group of corporations" (within the meaning of Section 414 of the
Code) maintains, sponsors or contributes to a "defined benefit plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA) or a "multiemployer pension plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(37)(A) of ERISA).

        4.11    COMPLIANCE. Each Borrower and, to Borrowers' best knowledge, the
Property and the use thereof comply in all material respects with all applicable
Legal Requirements (including with respect to parking and applicable zoning and
land use laws, regulations and ordinances). No Borrower is in default or
violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental
Authority, the violation of which might materially adversely affect the
condition (financial or otherwise) or business of any Borrower. The Property is
used exclusively as an office building property and other appurtenant and
related uses. In the event that all or any part of the Improvements are
destroyed or damaged, said Improvements can be legally reconstructed to their
condition prior to such damage or destruction, and thereafter exist

                                       29
<PAGE>

for the same use without violating any zoning or other ordinances applicable
thereto and without the necessity of obtaining any variances or special permits.
No legal proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of Borrowers, threatened
with respect to the zoning of the Property. Neither the zoning nor any other
right to construct, use or operate the Property is in any way dependent upon or
related to any property other than the Property. All certifications, permits,
licenses and approvals, including certificates of completion and occupancy
permits required for the legal use, occupancy and operation of the Property
(collectively, the "LICENSES"), have been obtained and are in full force and
effect. The use being made of the Property is in conformity with the certificate
of occupancy issued for the Property and all other restrictions, covenants and
conditions affecting the Property.

        4.12    CONTRACTS. There are no service, maintenance or repair contracts
affecting the Property that are not terminable on one month's notice or less
without cause and without penalty or premium. All service, maintenance or repair
contracts affecting the Property have been entered into at arms-length in the
ordinary course of the business of the Borrower which owns the Property and
provide for the payment of fees in amounts and upon terms comparable to existing
market rates.

        4.13    FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS; INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. No part of
the proceeds of the Loan will be used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring
any "margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System or for any other purpose that would be
inconsistent with such Regulation U or any other regulation of such Board of
Governors, or for any purpose prohibited by Legal Requirements or any Loan
Document. No Borrower is (i) an "investment company" or a company "controlled"
by an "investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended; (ii) a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company" or an "affiliate" of either a "holding company" or a
"subsidiary company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended; or (iii) subject to any other federal or state law or
regulation which purports to restrict or regulate its ability to borrow money.

        4.14    EASEMENTS; UTILITIES AND PUBLIC ACCESS. All easements, cross
easements, licenses, air rights and rights-of-way or other similar property
interests (collectively, "EASEMENTS"), if any, necessary for the full
utilization of the Improvements for their intended purposes have been obtained,
are described in the Title Insurance Policy and are in full force and effect
without default thereunder. The Property has rights of access to public ways and
is served by water, sewer, sanitary sewer and storm drain facilities adequate to
service it for its intended uses. All public utilities necessary or convenient
to the full use and enjoyment of the Property are located in the public
right-of-way abutting the Property, and all such utilities are connected so as
to serve the Property without passing over other property absent a valid
easement. All roads necessary for the use of the Property for its current
purpose have been completed and dedicated to public use and accepted by all
Governmental Authorities.

        4.15    PHYSICAL CONDITION. The Property, including all Improvements,
parking facilities, systems, Equipment and landscaping, are in good condition,
order and repair in all material respects; there exists no structural or other
material defect or damages to the Property, whether latent or otherwise. No
Borrower has received notice from any insurance company or bonding company of
any defect or inadequacy in the Property, or any part thereof, which would

                                       30
<PAGE>

adversely affect its insurability or cause the imposition of extraordinary
premiums or charges thereon or any termination of any policy of insurance or
bond. No portion of the Property is located in an area as identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards. The
Improvements have suffered no material casualty or damage which has not been
fully repaired and the cost thereof fully paid.

        4.16    LEASES. The rent roll attached hereto as Schedule 8 (the "RENT
ROLL") is true, complete and correct and the Property is not subject to any
Leases other than the Leases described in the Rent Roll. Except as set forth on
the Rent Roll: (i) each Lease is in full force and effect; (ii) the tenants
under the Leases have accepted possession of and are in occupancy of all of
their respective demised premises, have commenced the payment of rent under the
Leases, and there are no offsets, claims or defenses to the enforcement thereof;
(iii) all rents due and payable under the Leases have been paid and no portion
thereof has been paid for any period more than 30 days in advance; (iv) the rent
payable under each Lease is the amount of fixed rent set forth in the Rent Roll,
and there is no claim or basis for a claim by the tenant thereunder for an
adjustment to the rent; (v) to Borrowers' best knowledge, no tenant has made any
claim against the landlord under any Lease which remains outstanding, there are
no defaults on the part of the landlord under any Lease, and no event has
occurred which, with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, would
constitute such a default; (vi) to Borrowers' best knowledge, there is no
present material default by the tenant under any Lease; (vii) all security
deposits under Leases are as set forth on the Rent Roll and are held consistent
with Section 3.8; (viii) Borrowers are the sole owner of the entire lessor's
interest in each Lease; (ix) each Lease is the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of such Borrower and the applicable tenant thereunder; (x) to
Borrowers' best knowledge, no Person has any possessory interest in, or right to
occupy, the Property except under the terms of the Lease; and (xi) each Lease is
subordinate to the Loan Documents, either pursuant to its terms or pursuant to a
subordination and attornment agreement. None of the Leases contains any option
to purchase or right of first refusal to purchase the Property or any part
thereof. Neither the Leases nor the Rents have been assigned or pledged except
to Lender, and no other Person has any interest therein except the tenants
thereunder.

        4.17    FRAUDULENT TRANSFER. No Borrower has entered into the Loan or
any Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any
creditor, and Borrowers have received reasonably equivalent value in exchange
for their obligations under the Loan Documents. Giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, the fair saleable value of
Borrowers' assets exceeds and will, immediately following the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents, exceed Borrowers' total liabilities, including
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed or contingent liabilities, including the
maximum amount of its contingent liabilities or its debts as such debts become
absolute and matured. Borrowers' assets do not and, immediately following the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents will not, constitute unreasonably
small capital to carry out their business as conducted or as proposed to be
conducted. No Borrower intends to, and does not believe that it will, incur
debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments)
beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the
timing and amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of such
Borrower).

        4.18    OWNERSHIP OF BORROWER.

                                       31

any trade name or has done or will not do business under any name other than its
actual name set forth herein and the trade name of the Property. The principal

<PAGE>

                (e)     The Tenant in Common Agreement provides that no party

upon by Lender notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by
Lender or on its behalf, provided, however, that the representations, warranties
and covenants set forth in Section 4.21 shall survive in perpetuity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is understood and
agreed that any representation made by a Borrowers relating to a Borrower shall
be deemed made only by such Borrower with respect to itself and not by any other
Borrower.

5.      COVENANTS

things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its
existence, rights, and franchises, (ii) continue to engage in the business

maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

        5.2     TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES. Borrowers shall pay all Taxes and Other
Charges prior to delinquency, and deliver to Lender receipts for payment or
other evidence satisfactory to

                                       34
<PAGE>

Lender that the Taxes and Other Charges have been so paid prior to delinquency
(provided, however, that Borrowers need not pay such Taxes nor furnish such
receipts for payment of Taxes paid by Lender pursuant to Section 3.3). Borrowers
shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and discharged any Lien
against the Property, and shall promptly pay for all utility services provided
to the Property. After prior notice to Lender, Borrowers, at their own expense,
may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and conducted in
good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity or application of any
Taxes or Other Charges, provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, (ii) such proceeding shall suspend the collection of the Taxes or
such Other Charges, (iii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of any other instrument to which any
Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder, (iv) no part
of or interest in the Property will be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, canceled or lost, (v) Borrowers shall have furnished such security
as may be required in the proceeding, or as may be requested by Lender, to

interest and penalties thereon, which shall not be less than 125% of the Taxes
and Other Charges being contested (less amounts then being retained in the Taxes
and Insurance Subaccount to pay such Taxes so contested), and (vi) Borrowers
shall promptly upon final determination thereof pay the amount of such Taxes or
Other Charges, together with all costs, interest and penalties. Lender may, with
the prior approval of Borrowers (not to be unreasonably withheld), pay over any
such security or part thereof held by Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at
any time when, in the judgment of Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is
established.

        5.3     ACCESS TO PROPERTY. Borrowers shall permit agents,
representatives, consultants and employees of Lender to inspect the Property or
any part thereof at reasonable hours upon reasonable advance notice.

Borrowers shall cause the Property to be maintained in a good and safe condition
and repair and shall not remove, demolish or alter the Improvements or Equipment
(except for alterations performed in accordance with Section 5.4.2 and normal
replacement of Equipment with Equipment of equivalent value and functionality).
Borrowers shall promptly comply with all Legal Requirements and immediately cure
properly any violation of a Legal Requirement. Borrowers shall notify Lender in
writing within three Business Days after any Borrower first receives notice of

part of the Property that becomes damaged, worn or dilapidated and shall
complete and pay for any Improvements at any time in the process of construction
or repair.

                5.4.2   ALTERATIONS. Borrowers may, without Lender's consent,
perform alterations to the Improvements and Equipment which (i) do not
constitute a Material Alteration, (ii) do not adversely affect any Borrower's
financial condition or the value or Net Operating Income of the Property and
(iii) are in the ordinary course of Borrowers' business. No Borrower shall
perform any Material Alteration without Lender's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Lender may, as a
condition to giving its consent

                                       35
<PAGE>

to a Material Alteration, require that Borrowers deliver to Lender security for
payment of the cost of such Material Alteration in an amount equal to 125% of
the cost of the Material Alteration as estimated by Lender. Upon substantial
completion of the Material Alteration, Borrowers shall provide evidence
satisfactory to Lender that (i) the Material Alteration was constructed in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and substantially in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by Lender (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) all contractors, subcontractors,
materialmen and professionals who provided work, materials or services in
connection with the Material Alteration have been paid in full and have
delivered unconditional releases of lien and (iii) all material Licenses
necessary for the use, operation and occupancy of the Material Alteration (other
than those which depend on the performance of tenant improvement work) have been
issued. Borrowers shall reimburse Lender upon demand for all out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including the reasonable fees of any architect, engineer or other
professional engaged by Lender) incurred by Lender in reviewing plans and
specifications or in making any determinations necessary to implement the
provisions of this Section 5.4.2.

        5.5     PERFORMANCE OF OTHER AGREEMENTS. Borrowers shall observe and
perform each and every term to be observed or performed by one or more Borrowers
pursuant to the terms of any agreement or instrument affecting or pertaining to
the Property, including the Loan Documents and the Tenant in Common Agreement.

        5.6     COOPERATE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Borrowers shall cooperate fully
with Lender with respect to, and permit Lender, at its option, to participate
in, any proceedings before any Governmental Authority which may in any way
affect the rights of Lender under any Loan Document.

        5.7     FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrowers shall, at Borrowers' sole cost and
expense, (i) execute and deliver to Lender such documents, instruments,
certificates, assignments and other writings, and do such other acts necessary
or desirable, to evidence, preserve and/or protect the collateral at any time
securing or intended to secure the Debt and/or for the better and more effective
carrying out of the intents and purposes of the Loan Documents, as Lender may
reasonably require from time to time; and (ii) upon Lender's request therefor
given from time to time after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
pay for (a) reports of UCC, federal tax lien, state tax lien, judgment and
pending litigation searches with respect to any Borrower and (b) searches of
title to the Property, each such search to be conducted by search firms
reasonably designated by Lender in each of the locations reasonably designated
by Lender.

        5.8     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                5.8.1   HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. So long as one or more Borrowers
own or are in possession of the Property, each such Borrower shall (i) keep the
Property free from Hazardous Substances and in compliance with all Environmental
Laws, (ii) promptly notify Lender if such Borrower shall become aware that (A)
any Hazardous Substance is on or near the Property, (B) the Property is in
violation of any Environmental Laws or (C) any condition on or near the Property
shall pose a threat to the health, safety or welfare of humans and (iii) remove
such Hazardous Substances and/or cure such violations and/or remove such
threats, as applicable, as required by law (or as shall be required by Lender in
the case of removal which is not required

                                       36
<PAGE>

by law, but in response to the opinion of a licensed hydrogeologist, licensed
environmental engineer or other qualified environmental consulting firm engaged
by Lender ("LENDER'S CONSULTANT")), promptly after such Borrower becomes aware
of same, at Borrowers' sole expense. Nothing herein shall prevent such Borrower
from recovering such expenses from any other party that may be liable for such
removal or cure.

                5.8.2   ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING.

                (a)     Borrowers shall give prompt written notice to Lender of
(i) any proceeding or inquiry by any party (including any Governmental
Authority) with respect to the presence of any Hazardous Substance on, under,
from or about the Property, (ii) all claims made or threatened by any third
party (including any Governmental Authority) against any Borrower or the
Property or any party occupying the Property relating to any loss or injury
resulting from any Hazardous Substance, and (iii) any Borrower's discovery of
any occurrence or condition on any real property adjoining or in the vicinity of
the Property that could cause the Property to be subject to any investigation or
cleanup pursuant to any Environmental Law. Upon becoming aware of the presence
of mold or fungus at the Property, Borrowers shall (i) undertake an
investigation to identify the source(s) of such mold or fungus and shall develop
and implement an appropriate remediation plan to eliminate the presence of any
Toxic Mold, (ii) perform or cause to be performed all acts reasonably necessary
for the remediation of any Toxic Mold (including taking any action necessary to
clean and disinfect any portions of the Property affected by Toxic Mold,
including providing any necessary moisture control systems at the Property), and
(iii) provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender of the foregoing.
Borrowers shall permit Lender to join and participate in, as a party if it so
elects, any legal or administrative proceedings or other actions initiated with
respect to the Property in connection with any Environmental Law or Hazardous
Substance, and Borrowers shall pay all reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements incurred by Lender in connection therewith.

                (b)     Upon Lender's request, at any time and from time to
time, Borrowers shall provide an inspection or audit of the Property prepared by
a licensed hydrogeologist, licensed environmental engineer or qualified
environmental consulting firm approved by Lender assessing the presence or
absence of Hazardous Substances on, in or near the Property, and if Lender in
its good faith judgment determines that reasonable cause exists for the
performance of such environmental inspection or audit, then the cost and expense
of such audit or inspection shall be paid by Borrowers. Such inspections and
audit may include soil bearings and ground water monitoring. If Borrowers fail
to provide any such inspection or audit within 30 days after such request,
Lender may order same, and Borrowers hereby grant to Lender and its employees
and agents access to the Property and a license to undertake such inspection or
audit.

                (c)     If any environmental site assessment report prepared in
connection with such inspection or audit recommends that an operations and
maintenance plan be implemented for any Hazardous Substance, whether such
Hazardous Substance existed prior to the ownership of the Property by any
Borrower, or presently exists or is reasonably suspected of existing, Borrowers
shall cause such operations and maintenance plan to be prepared and implemented
at their expense upon request of Lender, and with respect to any Toxic Mold,
Borrowers shall take all action necessary to clean and disinfect any portions of
the Improvements affected by Toxic Mold in or about the Improvements, including
providing any necessary moisture control systems at the

                                       37

Property. If any investigation, site monitoring, containment, cleanup, removal,
restoration or other work of any kind is reasonably necessary under an
applicable Environmental Law ("REMEDIAL WORK"), Borrowers shall commence all
such Remedial Work within 30 days after written demand by Lender and thereafter
diligently prosecute to completion all such Remedial Work within such period of
time as may be required under applicable law). All Remedial Work shall be
performed by licensed contractors approved in advance by Lender and under the
supervision of a consulting engineer approved by Lender. All costs of such
Remedial Work shall be paid by Borrowers, including Lender's reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with the monitoring or
review of such Remedial Work. If Borrowers do not timely commence and diligently
prosecute to completion the Remedial Work, Lender may (but shall not be
obligated to) cause such Remedial Work to be performed at Borrowers' expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers shall not be required to commence such
Remedial Work within the above specified time period: (x) if prevented from
doing so by any Governmental Authority, (y) if commencing such Remedial Work
within such time period would result in any Borrower or such Remedial Work
violating any Environmental Law, or (z) if Borrowers, at their expense and after
prior written notice to Lender, are contesting by appropriate legal,
administrative or other proceedings, conducted in good faith and with due
diligence, the need to perform Remedial Work. Borrowers shall have the right to
contest the need to perform such Remedial Work, provided that, (1) Borrowers are
permitted by the applicable Environmental Laws to delay performance of the
Remedial Work pending such proceedings, (2) neither the Property nor any part
thereof or interest therein will be sold, forfeited or lost if a Borrower fails
to promptly perform the Remedial Work being contested, and if such Borrower
fails to prevail in contest such Borrower would thereafter have the opportunity
to perform such Remedial Work, (3) Lender would not, by virtue of such permitted
contest, be exposed to any risk of any civil liability for which Borrowers have
not furnished additional security as provided in clause (4) below, or to any
risk of criminal liability, and neither the Property nor any interest therein
would be subject to the imposition of any Lien for which Borrowers have not
furnished additional security as provided in clause (4) below, as a result of
the failure to perform such Remedial Work and (4) Borrowers shall have furnished
to Lender additional security in respect of the Remedial Work being contested
and the loss or damage that may result from Borrowers' failure to prevail in
such contest in such amount as may be reasonably requested by Lender but in no
event less than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost of such
Remedial Work as estimated by Lender or Lender's Consultant and any loss or
damage that may result from Borrowers' failure to prevail in such contest.

                (d)     No Borrower shall install or permit to be installed on
the Property any underground storage tank.

        5.9     TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. Borrowers will warrant and defend the
title to the Property, and the validity and priority of all Liens granted or
otherwise given to Lender under the Loan Documents, subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances, against the claims of all Persons.

        5.10    LEASES.

                5.10.1  GENERALLY. Upon request, Borrowers shall furnish Lender
with executed copies of all Leases then in effect (other than Leases that have
previously been furnished to Lender). All renewals of Leases and all proposed
leases shall provide for rental rates and terms

                                       38
<PAGE>

comparable to existing local market rates and shall be arm's length transactions
with bona fide, independent third-party tenants.

                5.10.2  MATERIAL LEASES. No Borrower shall enter into a proposed
Material Lease or a proposed renewal, extension (other than a renewal or
extension that is being unilaterally exercised by a tenant pursuant to the terms
of an existing Lease, with respect to which Lender shall not have any consent
rights) or modification of an existing Material Lease without the prior written
consent of Lender, which consent shall not, so long as no Event of Default is
continuing, be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prior to seeking Lender's
consent to any Material Lease, Borrowers shall deliver to Lender a copy of such
proposed lease (a "PROPOSED MATERIAL LEASE") blacklined to show changes from the
standard form of Lease approved by Lender and then being used by Borrowers.
Lender shall approve or disapprove each Proposed Material Lease or proposed
renewal, extension or modification of an existing Material Lease for which
Lender's approval is required under this Agreement within 10 Business Days of
the submission by Borrowers to Lender of a written request for such approval,
accompanied by a final copy of the Proposed Material Lease or proposed renewal,
extension or modification of an existing Material Lease. If requested by
Borrowers, Lender will grant conditional approvals of Proposed Material Leases
or proposed renewals, extensions or modifications of existing Material Leases at
any stage of the leasing process, from initial "term sheet" through negotiated
lease drafts, provided that Lender shall retain the right to disapprove any such
Proposed Material Lease or proposed renewal, extension or modification of an
existing Material Lease, if subsequent to any preliminary approval material
changes are made to the terms previously approved by Lender, or additional
material terms are added that had not previously been considered and approved by
Lender in connection with such Proposed Material Lease or proposed renewal,
extension or modification of an existing Material Lease. Provided that no Event
of Default is continuing, if Borrowers provide Lender with a written request for
approval (which written request shall specifically refer to this Section 5.10.2
and shall explicitly state that failure by Lender to approve or disapprove
within 10 Business Days will constitute a deemed approval) and Lender fails to
reject the request in writing delivered to Borrowers within 10 Business Days
after receipt by Lender of the request, the Proposed Material Lease or proposed
renewal, extension or modification of an existing Material Lease shall be deemed
approved by Lender, and Borrowers shall be entitled to enter into such Proposed
Material Lease or proposed renewal, extension or modification of an existing
Material Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.10,
unless expressly agreed to in writing by Lender, any approval or deemed approval
by Lender of a proposed Lease or proposed renewal, extension or modification of
an existing Lease pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not be deemed to
constitute (in and of itself) an approval or deemed approval by Lender of any
Approved Leasing Expenses in connection therewith.

                5.10.3  MINOR LEASES. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.10.2 above, provided that no Event of Default is continuing, renewals,
amendments and modifications of existing Leases and proposed leases shall not be
subject to the prior approval of Lender provided (i) the proposed lease would be
a Minor Lease or the existing Lease as amended or modified or the renewal Lease
is a Minor Lease, (ii) the proposed lease shall be written substantially in
accordance with the standard form of Lease which shall have been approved by
Lender, (iii) the Lease as amended or modified or the renewal Lease or series of
leases or proposed lease or series of leases: (a) shall provide for net
effective rental rates comparable to existing local market rates,

                                       39
<PAGE>

(b) with respect to any new Lease with a new tenant (other than kiosks and
vending machines), shall have an initial term (together with all renewal
options) of not less than three years or greater than ten years, (c) shall
provide for automatic self-operative subordination to the Mortgage and, at
Lender's option, (x) attornment to Lender and (y) the unilateral right by
Lender, at the option of Lender, to subordinate the Lien of the Mortgage to the
Lease, and (d) shall not contain any option to purchase, any right of first
refusal to purchase, any right to terminate (except in the event of the
destruction or condemnation of substantially all of the Property), any
requirement for a non-disturbance or recognition agreement, or any other
provision which might adversely affect the rights of Lender under the Loan
Documents in any material respect. Borrowers shall deliver to Lender copies of
all Leases which are entered into pursuant to the preceding sentence together
with Borrowers' certification that it has satisfied all of the conditions of the
preceding sentence within ten days after the execution of the Lease.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.10 to the contrary, at Borrowers'
request and at Borrowers' sole cost and expense, Lender shall enter into a
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement on Lender's then current
form with any tenant under a Lease of at least 2,500 rentable square feet.

                5.10.4  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO LEASES. Each
Borrower (i) shall observe and perform the material obligations imposed upon the
lessor under the Leases and shall not do or permit anything to impair the value
of the Leases as security for the Debt; (ii) shall promptly send copies to
Lender of all notices of default that such Borrower shall send or receive under
any Lease; (iii) shall enforce, in accordance with commercially reasonable
practices for properties similar to the Property, the terms, covenants and
conditions in the Leases to be observed or performed by the lessees, short of
termination thereof; (iv) shall not collect any of the Rents more than one month
in advance (other than security deposits); (v) shall not execute any other
assignment of lessor's interest in the Leases or the Rents (except as
contemplated by the Loan Documents); (vi) shall not modify any Lease in a manner
inconsistent with the Loan Documents; (vii) shall not convey or transfer or
suffer or permit a conveyance or transfer of the Property so as to effect a
merger of the estates and rights of, or a termination or diminution of the
obligations of, lessees under Leases; (viii) shall not consent to any assignment
of or subletting under any Material Lease unless required in accordance with its
terms without the prior consent of Lender, which, with respect to a subletting,
may not, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; and (ix) shall not cancel or terminate any Lease or accept a
surrender thereof (except in the exercise of Borrowers' commercially reasonable
judgment in connection with a tenant default under a Minor Lease) without the
prior consent of Lender, which consent shall not, so long as no Event of Default
is continuing, be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

        5.11    ESTOPPEL STATEMENT. After request by Lender, Borrowers' Designee
shall within ten days furnish Lender with a statement addressed to Lender, its
successors and assigns, duly acknowledged and certified, setting forth (i) the
unpaid Principal, (ii) the Interest Rate, (iii) the date installments of
interest and/or Principal were last paid, (iv) any offsets or defenses to the
payment of the Debt, and (v) that the Loan Documents are valid, legal and
binding obligations and have not been modified or if modified, giving
particulars of such modification.

        5.12    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.

                                       40
<PAGE>

                5.12.1  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. Borrowers shall (i) cause the
Property to be managed pursuant to the Management Agreement; (ii) promptly
perform and observe all of the covenants required to be performed and observed
by them under the Management Agreement and do all things necessary to preserve
and to keep unimpaired their rights thereunder; (iii) promptly notify Lender of
any default under the Management Agreement of which they are aware; (iv)
promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial statement, business plan,
capital expenditure plan, and property improvement plan and any other notice,
report and estimate received by any Borrower under the Management Agreement; and
(v) promptly enforce the performance and observance of all of the covenants
required to be performed and observed by Manager under the Management Agreement.
Without Lender's prior written consent, no Borrower shall (a) surrender,
terminate, cancel, extend or renew the Management Agreement or otherwise replace
the Manager or enter into any other management agreement (except pursuant to
Section 5.12.2); (b) reduce or consent to the reduction of the term of the
Management Agreement; (c) increase or consent to the increase of the amount of
any charges under the Management Agreement; (d) otherwise modify, change,
supplement, alter or amend in any material respect, or waive or release any of
its rights and remedies under, the Management Agreement; (e) suffer or permit
the occurrence and continuance of a default beyond any applicable cure period
under the Management Agreement (or any successor management agreement) if such
default permits the Manager to terminate the Management Agreement (or such
successor management agreement); or (f) suffer or permit the ownership,
management or control of the Manager to be transferred to a Person other than an
Affiliate of Behringer.

                5.12.2  TERMINATION OF MANAGER. If (i) as of any Calculation
Date, Borrowers fail to maintain a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least
1.05:1 or (ii) an Event of Default shall be continuing, or (iii) Manager is in
default under the Management Agreement, or (iv) upon the gross negligence,
malfeasance or willful misconduct of the Manager, Borrowers shall, at the
request of Lender, terminate the Management Agreement and replace Manager with a
replacement manager acceptable to Lender in Lender's discretion and the
applicable Rating Agencies on terms and conditions satisfactory to Lender and
the applicable Rating Agencies. All calculations of the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio for purposes of this Section 5.12.2 shall be subject to verification by
Lender. Borrowers' failure to appoint an acceptable manager within thirty (30)
days after Lender's request of Borrowers to terminate the Management Agreement
shall constitute an immediate Event of Default. Borrowers may from time to time
appoint a successor manager to manage the Property, which successor manager and
Management Agreement shall be approved in writing by Lender in Lender's
discretion and the applicable Rating Agencies.

        5.13    SPECIAL PURPOSE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITY. Each Borrower shall at
all times be a Special Purpose Bankruptcy Remote Entity. No Borrower shall
directly or indirectly make any change, amendment or modification to its
organizational documents, or otherwise take any action which could result in
such Borrower not being a Special Purpose Bankruptcy Remote Entity. A "SPECIAL
PURPOSE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITY" shall have the meaning set forth on Schedule 5
hereto.

        5.14    ASSUMPTION IN NON-CONSOLIDATION OPINION. Each Borrower shall

non-consolidation opinion letter dated the date hereof delivered by Borrowers'
counsel in connection with the Loan, shall be true and correct in all respects.

        5.15    CHANGE IN BUSINESS OR OPERATION OF PROPERTY. Borrowers shall not
purchase or own any real property other than the Property and shall not enter
into any line of business other than the ownership and operation of the
Property, or make any material change in the scope or nature of their business
objectives, purposes or operations, or undertake or participate in activities
other than the continuance of its present business or otherwise cease to operate
the Property as an office building, or terminate such business for any reason
whatsoever (other than temporary cessation in connection with renovations to the
Property).

        5.16    DEBT CANCELLATION. No Borrower shall cancel or otherwise forgive
or release any claim or debt (other than termination of Leases in accordance
herewith) owed to such Borrower by any Person, except for adequate consideration
and in the ordinary course of such Borrower's business.

        5.17    AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. No Borrower shall enter into, or be a
party to, any transaction with an Affiliate of any Borrower or any of the
members of any Borrower except in the ordinary course of business and on terms
which are fully disclosed to Lender in advance and are no less favorable to such
Borrower or such Affiliate than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length
transaction with an unrelated third party.

        5.18    ZONING. No Borrower shall initiate or consent to any zoning
reclassification of any portion of the Property or seek any variance under any
existing zoning ordinance or use or permit the use of any portion of the
Property in any manner that could result in such use becoming a non-conforming
use under any zoning ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or
regulation, without the prior consent of Lender.

        5.19    NO JOINT ASSESSMENT. No Borrower shall suffer, permit or
initiate the joint assessment of the Property (i) with any other real property
constituting a tax lot separate from the Property, and (ii) with any portion of
the Property which may be deemed to constitute personal property, or any other
procedure whereby the lien of any taxes which may be levied against such
personal property shall be assessed or levied or charged to the Property.

        5.20    PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS. No Borrower shall change its
principal place of business or chief executive office without first giving
Lender 30 days' prior notice.

        5.21    CHANGE OF NAME, IDENTITY OR STRUCTURE. No Borrower shall change
its name, identity (including its trade name or names) or such Borrower's
corporate, partnership or other structure without notifying Lender of such
change in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such
change and, in the case of a change in such Borrower's structure, without first
obtaining the prior written consent of Lender. Each Borrower shall execute and
deliver to Lender, prior to or contemporaneously with the effective date of any
such change, any financing statement or financing statement change required by
Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the
security interest granted herein. At the request of Lender, each Borrower shall

warranting that such Borrower does business under no other trade name with
respect to the Property.

        5.22    INDEBTEDNESS. Borrowers shall not directly or indirectly create,
incur or assume any indebtedness other than the Debt and unsecured trade
payables incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to the ownership
and operation of the Property which do not exceed, at any time, a maximum amount
of 2% of the original amount of the Principal and are paid within sixty (60)
days of the date incurred or invoiced (collectively, "PERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS");
provided, however, such 2% limitation shall not apply to (i) any asset
management or property management fee payable pursuant to the terms of the
Management Agreement or (ii) any amounts that are payable out of the Capital
Reserve Subaccount, the Rollover Reserve Subaccount or any other reserves
established under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
the 60-day period set forth above, Borrowers may, after prior notice to Lender,
at their own expense, contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly
initiated and conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or
validity of any such Permitted Indebtedness (during which time such 60-day
period shall be tolled), provided that if Borrowers desire to withhold payment
of such Permitted Indebtedness during the pendency of the contest, (i) no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) no part of or interest in the
Property will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, canceled or
lost, (iii) Borrowers shall have furnished such security as may be required in
the proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by Lender, to insure the
payment of any such Permitted Indebtedness, together with all interest and
penalties thereon, which shall not be less than 125% of the Permitted
Indebtedness being contested, and (iv) Borrowers shall promptly upon final
determination thereof pay the amount of such Permitted Indebtedness, together
with all costs, interest and penalties and Borrower shall be permitted to use
such security to make such payment.

        5.25    ERISA.

                5.25.1.1 No Borrower shall engage in any transaction which would
cause any obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise
by Lender of any of its rights under the Note, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents) to be a non-exempt (under a statutory or administrative class
exemption) prohibited transaction under ERISA.

                5.25.1.2 No Borrower shall maintain, sponsor, contribute to or
become obligated to contribute to, or suffer or permit any ERISA Affiliate of

7.      INSURANCE; CASUALTY; AND CONDEMNATION

        7.1     INSURANCE.

                7.1.1   COVERAGE. Borrowers, at their sole cost, for the mutual
benefit of each Borrower and Lender, shall obtain and maintain during the Term
the following policies of insurance:

                (a)     Property insurance insuring against loss or damage

including fire, lightning, flood, vandalism, and malicious mischief, boiler and
machinery and, if available and subject to subsection (j) below, coverage for
damage or destruction caused by the acts of "Terrorists" (or such policies shall
have no exclusion from coverage with respect thereto) and such other insurable
hazards as, under good insurance practices, from time to time are insured
against for other property and buildings similar to the premises in nature, use,
location, height, and type of construction. Such insurance policy shall also
insure costs of demolition and increased cost of construction (which insurance
for demolition and increased cost of construction may contain a sub-limit
satisfactory to Lender). Each such insurance policy shall (i) be in an amount
equal to the greatest of (A) the then replacement cost of the Improvements
without deduction for physical depreciation, (B) the unpaid Principal, and (C)
such amount as is necessary so that the insurer would not deem Borrower a
co-insurer under such policies, (ii) have deductibles no greater than the lesser
of $10,000 or 5% of the Net Operating Income per occurrence, (iii) be paid
annually in advance and (iv) contain an agreed amount replacement cost
endorsement with a waiver of depreciation, and shall cover, without limitation,
all tenant improvements and betterments that Borrower is required to insure on a
replacement cost basis. If the insurance required under this subparagraph is not
obtained by blanket insurance policies, the insurance policy shall be endorsed
to also provide guaranteed building replacement cost to the Improvements and
such tenant improvements in an amount to be subject to the consent of Lender,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Lender shall be named Loss
Payee on a Standard Mortgagee Endorsement.

                                       55
<PAGE>

                (b)     Flood insurance if any part of the Property is located
in an area now or hereafter designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as a Zone "A" & "V" Special Hazard Area, or such other Special Hazard
Area if Lender so requires in its sole discretion. Such policy shall (i) be in
an amount equal to the greater of (A) 100% of the full replacement cost of the
Improvements on the Property (without any deduction for depreciation) (B) the
maximum limit of coverage available and (ii) have a maximum permissible
deductible of $3,000.

                (c)     Public liability insurance, including (i) "Commercial
General Liability Insurance", (ii) "Owned", "Hired" and "Non Owned Auto
Liability"; and (iii) umbrella liability coverage for personal injury, bodily
injury, death, accident and property damage, such insurance providing in
combination no less than containing minimum limits per occurrence of $2,000,000
and $4,000,000 in the aggregate for any policy year; together with at least
$25,000,000 excess and/or umbrella liability insurance for any and all claims
with no deductible. The policies described in this subsection shall also include
coverage for elevators, escalators, independent contractors, "Contractual
Liability" (covering, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Borrower's
obligation to indemnify Lender as required under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents), "Products" and "Completed Operations Liability" coverage.

                (d)     Rental loss and/or business interruption insurance (i)
with Lender being named as "Lender Loss Payee", (ii) in an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the projected Rents from the Property during the
period of restoration; and (iii) containing an extended period of indemnity
endorsement which provides that after the physical loss to the Property has been
repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until such income either
returns to the same level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of
eighteen (18) months from the date that the Property is repaired or replaced and
operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding that the
policy may expire prior to the end of such period. The amount of such insurance
shall be increased from time to time during the Term as and when the estimated
or actual Rents increase.

                (e)     Comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance covering
all mechanical and electrical equipment against physical damage, rent loss and
improvements loss and covering, without limitation, all tenant improvements and
betterments that Borrower is required to insure pursuant to the lease on a
replacement cost basis and in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $2,000,000
and (ii) 100% of the full replacement cost of the Improvements on the Property
(without any deduction for depreciation).

                (f)     Worker's compensation and disability insurance with
respect to any employees of Borrower, as required by any Legal Requirement.

                (g)     During any period of repair or restoration, builder's
"all-risk" insurance in an amount equal to not less than the full insurable
value of the Property, against such risks (including fire and extended coverage
and collapse of the Improvements to agreed limits) as Lender may request, in
form and substance acceptable to Lender.

                (h)     Coverage to compensate for the cost of demolition and
the increased cost of construction in an amount satisfactory to Lender.

                                       56
<PAGE>

                (i)     Such other insurance (including environmental liability
insurance, earthquake (but only if a future seismic study indicates a PML in
excess of 20%) insurance, mine subsidence insurance and windstorm insurance) as
may from time to time be reasonably required by Lender in order to protect its
interests.

                (j)     Notwithstanding anything in subsection (a) above to the
contrary, Borrowers shall be required to obtain and maintain coverage in their
property insurance Policy (or by a separate Policy) against loss or damage by
terrorist acts in an amount equal to 100% of the "Full Replacement Cost" of the
Property; provided that such coverage is available. In the event that such
coverage with respect to terrorist acts is not included as part of the "all
risk" property policy required by subsection (a) above, Borrowers shall,
nevertheless be required to obtain coverage for terrorism (as stand alone
coverage) in an amount equal to 100% of the "Full Replacement Cost" of the
Property; provided that such coverage is available. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any such stand-alone policy covering terrorist acts,
Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Insurance Premiums solely with
respect to such terrorism coverage in excess of the Terrorism Premium Cap
(hereinafter defined); provided that if the Insurance Premiums payable with
respect to such terrorism coverage exceeds the Terrorism Premium Cap, Lender
may, at its option (1) purchase such stand-alone terrorism Policy, with Borrower
paying such portion of the Insurance Premiums with respect thereto equal to the
Terrorism Premium Cap and the Lender paying such portion of the Insurance
Premiums in excess of the Terrorism Premium Cap or (2) modify the deductible
amounts, policy limits and other required policy terms to reduce the Insurance
Premiums payable with respect to such stand-alone terrorism Policy to the
Terrorism Premium Cap. As used herein, (i) "TERRORISM PREMIUM CAP" means an
amount equal to 100% of the aggregate Insurance Premiums payable with respect to
all the insurance coverage under Section 7.1.1(a) for the last policy year in
which coverage for terrorism was included as part of the "all risk" property
policy required by subsection (a) above, adjusted annually by a percentage equal
to the increase in the Consumer Price Index (hereinafter defined) and (ii)
"CONSUMER PRICE INDEX" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of
Labor, New York Metropolitan Statistical Area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), or any
successor index thereto, approximately adjusted, and in the event that the
Consumer Price Index is converted to a different standard reference base or
otherwise revised, the determination of adjustments provided for herein shall be
made with the use of such conversion factor, formula or table for converting the
Consumer Price Index as may be published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or,
if said Bureau shall not publish the same, then with the use of such conversion
factor, formula or table as may be published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., or any
other nationally recognized publisher of similar statistical information; and if
the Consumer Price Index ceases to be published, and there is no successor
thereto (i) such other index as Lender and Borrower shall agree upon in writing
or (ii) if Lender and Borrower cannot agree on a substitute index, such other
index, as reasonably selected by Lender. Borrower shall obtain the coverage
required under this subsection (j) from a carrier which otherwise satisfies the
rating criteria specified in Section 7.1.2 (a "QUALIFIED CARRIER") or in the
event that such coverage is not available from a Qualified Carrier, Borrower
shall obtain such coverage from the highest rated insurance company providing
such coverage.

                7.1.2   POLICIES. All policies of insurance (the "POLICIES")
required pursuant to Section 7.1.1 shall (i) be issued by companies approved by
Lender and licensed to do business in the State, with a claims paying ability
rating of "AA" or better by S&P (and the equivalent by

                                       57
<PAGE>

any other Rating Agency) and a rating of A:X or better in the current Best's
Insurance Reports; (ii) name Lender and its successors and/or assigns as their
interest may appear as the mortgagee (in the case of property insurance) or an
additional insured (in the case of liability insurance); (iii) contain (in the
case of property insurance) a Non-Contributory Standard Mortgagee Clause and a
Lender's Loss Payable Endorsement, or their equivalents, naming Lender as the
person to which all payments made by such insurance company shall be paid; (iv)
contain a waiver of subrogation against Lender; (v) be assigned and the
originals thereof delivered to Lender; (vi) contain such provisions as Lender
deems reasonably necessary or desirable to protect its interest, including (A)
endorsements providing that neither any Borrower, Lender nor any other party
shall be a co-insurer under the Policies, (B) that Lender shall receive at least
30 days' prior written notice of any modification, reduction or cancellation of
any of the Policies, (C) an agreement whereby the insurer waives any right to
claim any premiums and commissions against Lender, provided that the policy need
not waive the requirement that the premium be paid in order for a claim to be
paid to the insured and (D) providing that Lender is permitted to make payments
to effect the continuation of such policy upon notice of cancellation due to
non-payment of premiums; (vii) in the event any insurance policy (except for
general public and other liability and workers compensation insurance) shall
contain breach of warranty provisions, such policy shall provide that with
respect to the interest of Lender, such insurance policy shall not be
invalidated by and shall insure Lender regardless of (A) any act, failure to act
or negligence of or violation of warranties, declarations or conditions
contained in such policy by any named insured, (B) the occupancy or use of the
premises for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms thereof, or (C)
any foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken by Lender pursuant to any
provision of the Loan Documents; and (viii) be satisfactory in form and
substance to Lender and approved by Lender as to amounts, form, risk coverage,
deductibles, loss payees and insureds. Borrowers shall pay the premiums for such
Policies (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS") as the same become due and payable and
furnish to Lender evidence of the renewal of each of the Policies together with
(unless such Insurance Premiums have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section
3.3) receipts for or other evidence of the payment of the Insurance Premiums
reasonably satisfactory to Lender. If Borrowers do not furnish such evidence and
receipts at least 30 days prior to the expiration of any expiring Policy, then
Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, procure such insurance and pay the
Insurance Premiums therefor, and Borrowers shall reimburse Lender for the cost
of such Insurance Premiums promptly on demand, with interest accruing at the
Default Rate. Borrowers shall deliver to Lender a certified copy of each Policy
within 30 days after its effective date. Within 30 days after request by Lender,
Borrowers shall obtain such increases in the amounts of coverage required
hereunder as may be reasonably requested by Lender, taking into consideration
changes in the value of money over time, changes in liability laws, changes in
prudent customs and practices, and the like.

        7.2     CASUALTY.

                7.2.1   NOTICE; RESTORATION. If the Property is damaged or
destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"),
Borrowers shall give prompt notice thereof to Lender. Following the occurrence
of a Casualty, Borrowers, regardless of whether insurance proceeds are
available, shall promptly proceed to restore, repair, replace or rebuild the
Property in accordance with Legal Requirements to be of at least equal value and
of substantially the same character as prior to such damage or destruction.

                                       58
<PAGE>

                7.2.2   SETTLEMENT OF PROCEEDS. If a Casualty covered by any of
the Policies (an "INSURED CASUALTY") occurs where the loss does not exceed
$250,000, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrowers
may settle and adjust any claim without the prior consent of Lender; provided
such adjustment is carried out in a competent and timely manner, and Borrowers
are hereby authorized to collect and receipt for the insurance proceeds (the
"PROCEEDS"). In the event of an Insured Casualty where the loss equals or
exceeds $250,000 (a "SIGNIFICANT CASUALTY"), Borrowers may settle and adjust any
claim with the prior consent of Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless either (i) an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing or (ii) the loss equals or exceeds $1,000,000, in which either such
case Lender may, in its sole discretion, settle and adjust any claim without the
consent of any Borrower and agree with the insurer(s) on the amount to be paid
on the loss, and the Proceeds shall be due and payable solely to Lender and held
by Lender in the Casualty/Condemnation Subaccount and disbursed in accordance
herewith. If any Borrower or any party other than Lender is a payee on any check
representing Proceeds with respect to a Significant Casualty, such Borrower
shall immediately endorse, and cause all such third parties to endorse, such
check payable to the order of Lender. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints
Lender as its attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to endorse such check
payable to the order of Lender. The expenses incurred by Lender in the
settlement, adjustment and collection of the Proceeds shall become part of the
Debt and shall be reimbursed by Borrowers to Lender upon demand. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if in connection with a Casualty any
insurance carrier makes a payment under the Property insurance Policy that
Borrowers propose be treated as business or rental interruption insurance, then,
notwithstanding any designation (or lack of designation) by the insurance
carrier as to the purpose of such payment, as between Lender and Borrowers, such
payment shall not be treated as business or rental interruption insurance
proceeds unless Borrowers have demonstrated to Lender's satisfaction that the
remaining net Proceeds that will be received from the property insurance
carriers are sufficient to pay 100% of the cost of fully restoring the
Improvements or, if such net Proceeds are to be applied to repay the Debt in
accordance with the terms hereof, that such remaining net Proceeds will be
sufficient to pay the Debt in full.

        7.3     CONDEMNATION.

                7.3.1   NOTICE; RESTORATION. Borrowers shall promptly give
Lender notice of the actual or threatened commencement of any condemnation or
eminent domain proceeding affecting the Property (a "CONDEMNATION") and shall
deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers served in connection with such
Condemnation. Following the occurrence of a Condemnation, Borrowers, regardless
of whether an Award is available, shall promptly proceed to restore, repair,
replace or rebuild the Property in accordance with Legal Requirements to the
extent practicable to be of at least equal value and of substantially the same
character (and to have the same utility) as prior to such Condemnation.

                7.3.2   COLLECTION OF AWARD. If a Condemnation occurs where the
award or payment in respect thereof (an "Award") does not exceed $250,000 or
which results in the taking of 5% or less of the Property, provided no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrowers may make any compromise,
adjustment or settlement in connection with such Condemnation with the prior
consent of Lender, not to be unreasonably withheld, provided such adjustment is
carried out in a competent and timely manner, and Borrowers are hereby

                                       59
<PAGE>

authorized to collect and receipt for the Award. In the event of a Condemnation
where the Award is in excess of $250,000 or which results in the taking of more
than 5% of the Property, Lender is hereby irrevocably appointed as Borrowers'
attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, with exclusive power to collect,
receive and retain such Award and to make any compromise, adjustment or
settlement in connection with such Condemnation with the prior consent of
Borrowers (unless an Event of Default is continuing, in which case, Borrowers'
prior consent shall not be required), not to be unreasonably withheld (which
shall be deemed consented to if Borrowers fail to respond to any request for
consent therefor within 10 days' of request). Notwithstanding any Condemnation
(or any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of such Condemnation),
Borrowers shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided
for in the Loan Documents, and the Debt shall not be reduced unless and until
any Award shall have been actually received and applied by Lender to expenses of
collecting the Award and to discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited
to the interest paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be
entitled to receive out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided in
the Note. If the Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to
the receipt by Lender of such Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not
a deficiency judgment on the Note shall be recoverable or shall have been
sought, recovered or denied, to receive all or a portion of the Award sufficient
to pay the Debt. Borrowers shall cause any Award that is payable to Borrower to
be paid directly to Lender. Lender shall hold such Award in the
Casualty/Condemnation Subaccount and disburse such Award in accordance with the
terms hereof.

        7.4     APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OR AWARD.

                7.4.1   APPLICATION TO RESTORATION. If an Insured Casualty or
Condemnation occurs where (i) the loss is in an aggregate amount less than the
25% of the unpaid Principal, (ii) in the reasonable judgment of Lender, the
Property can be restored within nine months after all applicable restoration
permits have been obtained, and prior to six months before the Stated Maturity
Date and prior to the expiration of the rental or business interruption
insurance with respect thereto, to the Property's pre-existing condition and
utility as existed immediately prior to such Insured Casualty or Condemnation
and to an economic unit not less valuable and not less useful than the same was
immediately prior to the Insured Casualty or Condemnation, and after such
restoration will adequately secure the Debt, (iii) less than (x) 30%, in the
case of an Insured Casualty or (y) 15%, in the case of a Condemnation, of the
rentable area of the Improvements has been damaged, destroyed or rendered
unusable as a result of such Insured Casualty or Condemnation; (iv) Leases
demising in the aggregate at least 65% of the total rentable space in the
Property and in effect as of the date of the occurrence of such Insured Casualty
or Condemnation remain in full force and effect during and after the completion
of the Restoration (hereinafter defined); and (v) no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be then continuing, then the Proceeds or the Award, as the case may
be (after reimbursement of any expenses incurred by Lender), shall be applied to
pay for or reimburse Borrowers for the cost of restoring, repairing, replacing
or rebuilding the Property (the "Restoration"), in the manner set forth herein.
Borrowers shall commence and diligently prosecute such Restoration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Lender be obligated to apply
the Proceeds or Award to reimburse any Borrower for the cost of Restoration
unless, in addition to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, both (x)
Borrowers shall pay (and if required by Lender, Borrowers shall deposit with
Lender in advance) all costs of such Restoration in excess of the net amount of
the Proceeds or

                                       60
<PAGE>

the Award made available pursuant to the terms hereof; and (y) Lender shall have
received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that during the period of the
Restoration, the Rents will be at least equal to the sum of the operating
expenses and Debt Service, as reasonably determined by Lender.

                7.4.2   APPLICATION TO DEBT. Except as provided in Section
7.4.1, any Proceeds and/or Award may, at the option of Lender in its discretion,
be applied to the payment of (i) accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, (ii)
the unpaid Principal and (iii) other charges due under the Note and/or any of
the other Loan Documents, or applied to reimburse Borrowers for the cost of any
Restoration, in the manner set forth in Section 7.4.3. Any such prepayment of
the Loan shall be without any Yield Maintenance Premium, unless an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing at the time the Proceeds are received
from the insurance company or the Award is received from the condemning
authority, as the case may be, in which event Borrowers shall pay to Lender an
additional amount equal to the Yield Maintenance Premium, if any, that may be
required with respect to the amount of the Proceeds or Award applied to the
unpaid Principal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
any Proceeds or Award are not required to be made available for a Restoration
and are retained and applied by Lender toward the payment of the Debt, Borrowers
may prepay the entire outstanding Principal without payment of any Yield
Maintenance Premium provided that (x) such prepayment is made within 90 days
after Lender applies such Proceeds or Award to the Debt and (y) together with
such prepayment, Borrowers pay to Lender all accrued and unpaid interest and all
other sums payable under the Loan Documents.

                7.4.3   PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATION TO RESTORATION. If any
Borrower is entitled to reimbursement out of the Proceeds or an Award held by
Lender, such Proceeds or Award shall be disbursed from time to time from the
Casualty/Condemnation Subaccount upon Lender being furnished with (i) evidence
satisfactory to Lender of the estimated cost of completion of the Restoration,
(ii) a fixed price or guaranteed maximum cost construction contract for
Restoration satisfactory to Lender, (iii) prior to the commencement of
Restoration, all immediately available funds in addition to the Proceeds or
Award that in Lender's judgment are required to complete the proposed
Restoration, (iv) such architect's certificates, waivers of lien, contractor's
sworn statements, title insurance endorsements, bonds, plats of survey, permits,
approvals, licenses and such other documents and items as Lender may reasonably
require and approve in Lender's discretion, and (v) all plans and specifications
for such Restoration, such plans and specifications to be approved by Lender
prior to commencement of any work. Lender may, at Borrowers' expense, retain a
consultant to review and approve all requests for disbursements, which approval
shall also be a condition precedent to any disbursement. No payment made prior
to the final completion of the Restoration shall exceed 90% of the value of the
work performed from time to time; funds other than the Proceeds or Award shall
be disbursed prior to disbursement of such Proceeds or Award; and at all times,
the undisbursed balance of such Proceeds or Award remaining in the hands of
Lender, together with funds deposited for that purpose or irrevocably committed
to the satisfaction of Lender by or on behalf of Borrowers for that purpose,
shall be at least sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Lender to pay for the
cost of completion of the Restoration, free and clear of all Liens or claims for
Lien. Provided no Default or Event of Default then exists, any surplus that
remains out of the Proceeds held by Lender after payment of such costs of
Restoration shall be paid to Borrowers. Any surplus that remains out of the

                                       61
<PAGE>

Award received by Lender after payment of such costs of Restoration shall, in
the discretion of Lender, be retained by Lender and applied to payment of the
Debt or returned to Borrowers.

8.      DEFAULTS

        8.1     EVENTS OF DEFAULT. An "Event of Default" shall exist with
respect to the Loan if any of the following shall occur:

                (a)     any portion of the Debt is not paid when due or any
other amount under Section 3.11(a)(i) through (viii) is not paid in full on each
Payment Date (provided, however, if adequate funds are available in the Deposit
Account for such payments, the failure by the Deposit Bank to allocate such
funds into the appropriate Subaccounts shall not constitute an Event of
Default);

                (b)     any of the Taxes are not paid when due (unless Lender is
paying such Taxes pursuant to Section 3.3), subject to Borrowers' right to
contest Taxes in accordance with Section 5.2;

                (c)     the Policies are not kept in full force and effect, or
are not delivered to Lender pursuant to Section 7.1.2(v) within 10 days after
request;

                (d)     a Transfer other than a Permitted Transfer occurs;

                (e)     any representation or warranty made by any Borrower or
Guarantor or in any Loan Document, or in any report, certificate, financial
statement or other instrument, agreement or document furnished by any Borrower
or Guarantor in connection with any Loan Document, shall be false or misleading
in any material respect as of the date the representation or warranty was made;

                (f)     any Borrower or Guarantor shall make an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or shall generally not be paying its debts as they
become due; provided that so long as no other Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, an assignment for the benefit of creditors by any
one Guarantor (other than Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC or Robert M.
Behringer) shall not be an Event of Default hereunder if the tenant-in-common
ownership interest indirectly owned by such Guarantor is purchased by any
Borrower (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Agreement) within 30 days of such assignment in accordance with Section 9.1 of
the Tenant in Common Agreement, and the owner/guarantor of such purchasing
Borrower reaffirms its obligations under its Guaranty of Recourse Obligations in
connection therewith;

                (g)     a receiver, liquidator or trustee shall be appointed for
any Borrower or Guarantor; or any Borrower or Guarantor shall be adjudicated a
bankrupt or insolvent; or any petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or
arrangement pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state
law, shall be filed by or against, consented to, or acquiesced in by, any
Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may be; or any proceeding for the dissolution
or liquidation of any Borrower or Guarantor shall be instituted; provided,
however, (i) if such appointment, adjudication, petition or proceeding was
involuntary and not consented to by such Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may
be, only upon the same not being discharged, stayed or

                                       62
<PAGE>

dismissed within 60 days and (ii) so long as no other Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the occurrence of any event described in this
subsection (g) with respect to any one Guarantor (other than Behringer Harvard
Holdings, LLC or Robert M. Behringer) shall not be an Event of Default hereunder
if the tenant-in-common ownership interest indirectly owned by such Guarantor is
purchased by any Borrower (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
contained in this Agreement) within 30 days of the occurrence of such event in
accordance with Section 9.1 of the Tenant in Common Agreement, and the
owner/guarantor of such purchasing Borrower reaffirms its obligations under its
Guaranty of Recourse Obligations in connection therewith;

                (h)     any Borrower breaches any covenant contained in Sections
5.12.1 (a) - (f), 5.13, 5.15, 5.22, 5.25, 5.28 or 5.31;

                (i)     except as expressly permitted hereunder, the alteration,
improvement, demolition or removal of all or any of portion of the Improvements
without the prior written consent of Lender (if such consent is required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement);

                (j)     an Event of Default as defined or described elsewhere in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document occurs; or any other event shall
occur or condition shall exist, if the effect of such event or condition is to
accelerate or to permit Lender to accelerate the maturity of any portion of the
Debt;

                (k)     a default occurs under any term, covenant or provision
set forth herein or in any other Loan Document which specifically contains a
notice requirement or grace period and such notice has been given and such grace
period has expired;

                (l)     any of the assumptions contained in any substantive
non-consolidation opinion, delivered to Lender by Borrowers' counsel in
connection with the Loan or otherwise hereunder, were not true and correct as of
the date of such opinion or thereafter became untrue or incorrect;

                (m)     if Key Principal fails to Control (as defined in clause
(ii) of the defined term "Control" in Section 1.1) the Manager and the day to
day management and operations of the Property (unless the Manager is replaced
with a successor manager in accordance with and subject to satisfaction of the
terms and conditions set forth in Section 5.12.2); or

                (n)     a default shall be continuing under any of the other
terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document not
otherwise specified in this Section 8.1, for ten days after notice to Borrowers
(and Guarantor, if applicable) from Lender, in the case of any default which can
be cured by the payment of a sum of money, or for 30 days after notice from
Lender in the case of any other default; provided, however, that if such
non-monetary default is susceptible of cure but cannot reasonably be cured
within such 30-day period, and Borrowers (or Guarantor, if applicable) shall
have commenced to cure such default within such 30-day period and thereafter
diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such 30-day period shall
be extended for an additional period of time as is reasonably necessary for
Borrowers (or Guarantor, if applicable) in the exercise of due diligence to cure
such default, such additional period not to exceed 60 days.

        8.2     REMEDIES.

                8.2.1   ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in
paragraph (f) or (g) of Section 8.1) and at any time and from time to time
thereafter during the continuance of such Event of Default, in addition to any
other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to the Loan Documents or at
law or in equity, Lender may take such action, without notice or demand, that
Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against any or all
Borrowers and in and to the Property; including declaring the Debt to be
immediately due and payable (including unpaid interest), Default Rate interest,
Late Payment Charges, Yield Maintenance Premium and any other amounts owing by
Borrowers), without notice or demand; and upon any Event of Default described in
paragraph (f) or (g) of Section 8.1, the Debt (including unpaid interest,
Default Rate interest, Late Payment Charges, Yield Maintenance Premium and any
other amounts owing by Borrowers) shall immediately and automatically become due
and payable, without notice or demand, and each Borrower hereby expressly waives
any such notice or demand, anything contained in any Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding.

                8.2.2   REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights,
powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrowers
under the Loan Documents or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at
any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be
declared, or be automatically, due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall
have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of
its rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents. Any such actions taken
by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently,
singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Lender may determine in its discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender
permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth in the Loan Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower agrees that if
an Event of Default is continuing, (i) to the extent permitted by applicable
law, Lender is not subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or
rule, and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to
Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of
its remedies against the Property, the Mortgage has been foreclosed, the
Property has been sold and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the
Debt or the Debt has been paid in full. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, nothing contained in any Loan Document shall be construed as requiring
Lender to resort to any particular Property or any portion of the Property for
the satisfaction of any of the Debt in preference or priority to any other
portion, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of the entire Property or any part
thereof, in its discretion.

                8.2.3   SEVERANCE. Lender shall have the right from time to time
to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes,
mortgages and other security documents in such denominations and priorities of
payment and liens as Lender shall determine in its discretion for purposes of
evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies. Each Borrower shall execute
and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a
severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to
effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Each Borrower hereby absolutely and
irrevocably appoints Lender as its

                                       64
<PAGE>

true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to
make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect such severance,
each Borrower ratifying all that such attorney shall do by virtue thereof.

                8.2.4   DELAY. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy,
right or power accruing upon an Event of Default, or the granting of any
indulgence or compromise by Lender shall impair any such remedy, right or power
hereunder or be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or
power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed
expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of Default shall not be construed to
be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default or to impair any
remedy, right or power consequent thereon. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, Lender reserves the right to seek a deficiency judgment or
preserve a deficiency claim in connection with the foreclosure of the Mortgage
to the extent necessary to foreclose on all or any portion of the Property, the
Rents, the Cash Management Accounts or any other collateral.

                8.2.5   LENDER'S RIGHT TO PERFORM. If any Borrower fails to
perform any covenant or obligation contained herein and such failure shall
continue for a period of five Business Days after Borrowers' receipt of written
notice thereof from Lender, without in any way limiting Lender's right to
exercise any of its rights, powers or remedies as provided hereunder, or under
any of the other Loan Documents, Lender may, but shall have no obligation to,
perform, or cause performance of, such covenant or obligation, and all costs,
expenses, liabilities, penalties and fines of Lender incurred or paid in
connection therewith shall be payable by Borrowers to Lender upon demand and if
not paid shall be added to the Debt (and to the extent permitted under
applicable laws, secured by the Mortgage and other Loan Documents) and shall
bear interest thereafter at the Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender shall have no obligation to send notice to any Borrower of any such
failure. Additionally, during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make any Protective Advance
(hereinafter defined) (provided, however, that Lender will only make such
Protective Advance from its own funds if there are insufficient funds in the
Cash Management Accounts), and the same shall be added to the Debt (and to the
extent permitted under applicable laws, secured by the Mortgage and other Loan
Documents) and shall bear interest thereafter at the Default Rate. As used
herein, "PROTECTIVE ADVANCE" means all sums advanced for the purpose of payment
of real estate taxes (including special payments in lieu of real estate taxes),
maintenance costs, insurance premiums, operating expenses, trade payables or
other items with respect to the Property (including capital items) reasonably
necessary to protect the Property or any other security given for the Loan or to
preserve any of Lender's rights or remedies under the Loan Documents.

9.      SPECIAL PROVISIONS

        9.1     SALE OF NOTE AND SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTION.

                9.1.1   GENERAL; BORROWER COOPERATION. Lender shall have the
right at any time and from time to time (i) to sell or otherwise transfer the
Loan or any portion thereof or the Loan Documents or any interest therein to one
or more investors, (ii) to sell participation interests in the Loan to one or
more investors or (iii) to securitize the Loan or any portion thereof in a
single asset securitization or a pooled loan securitization of rated single or
multi-class securities (the

                                       65
<PAGE>

"SECURITIES") secured by or evidencing ownership interests in the Note and the
Mortgage (each such sale, assignment, participation and/or securitization is
referred to herein as a "SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTION"). In connection with any
Secondary Market Transaction, Borrowers shall use all reasonable efforts and
cooperate fully and in good faith with Lender and otherwise assist Lender in
satisfying the market standards to which Lender customarily adheres or which may
be reasonably required in the marketplace or by the Rating Agencies in
connection with any such Secondary Market Transactions, including: (a) to (i)
provide such financial and other information with respect to the Property,
Borrowers and their Affiliates, Manager and any tenants of the Property, (ii)
provide business plans and budgets relating to the Property and (iii) perform or
permit or cause to be performed or permitted such site inspection, appraisals,
surveys, market studies, environmental reviews and reports, engineering reports
and other due diligence investigations of the Property, as may be reasonably
requested from time to time by Lender or the Rating Agencies or as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction or
Exchange Act requirements (the items provided to Lender pursuant to clauses (i)
and (ii) of this paragraph (a) being called the "PROVIDED INFORMATION"),
together, if customary, with appropriate verification of and/or consents to the
Provided Information through letters of auditors or opinions of counsel of
independent attorneys acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies; (b) at
Borrowers' expense, cause counsel to render opinions as to non-consolidation
(which may be an update of an existing non-consolidation opinion) and any other
opinion customary in securitization transactions with respect to the Property,
Borrowers and their Affiliates, which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Lender and the Rating Agencies; (c) make such representations
and warranties as of the closing date of any Secondary Market Transaction with
respect to the Property, Borrowers and the Loan Documents as are customarily
provided in such transactions and as may be reasonably requested by Lender or
the Rating Agencies and consistent with the facts covered by such
representations and warranties as they exist on the date thereof, including the
representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents; (d) provide current
certificates of good standing and qualification with respect to Borrowers from
appropriate Governmental Authorities; and (e) execute such amendments to the
Loan Documents and Borrowers' organizational documents, as may be requested by
Lender or the Rating Agencies or otherwise to effect a Secondary Market
Transaction, provided that nothing contained in this subsection (e) shall result
in changes to Loan terms adverse to Borrowers or require Borrowers to incur any
additional liabilities. Borrowers' cooperation obligations set forth herein
shall continue until the Loan has been paid in full.

                9.1.2   USE OF INFORMATION. Borrowers understand that all or any
portion of the Provided Information and the Required Records may be included in
disclosure documents in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction,
including a prospectus or private placement memorandum (each, a "DISCLOSURE
DOCUMENT") and may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), or the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE
ACT"), or provided or made available to investors or prospective investors in
the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service providers or other parties
relating to the Secondary Market Transaction. If the Disclosure Document is
required to be revised, Borrowers shall cooperate with Lender in updating the
Provided Information or Required Records for inclusion or summary in the
Disclosure Document or for other use reasonably required in connection with a
Secondary Market Transaction by providing all current information pertaining to
Borrowers, Manager and

                                       66
<PAGE>

the Property necessary to keep the Disclosure Document accurate and complete in
all material respects with respect to such matters.

                9.1.3   BORROWER OBLIGATIONS REGARDING DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS. In
connection with a Disclosure Document, Borrowers' Designee (on behalf of
Borrowers) shall: (a) if requested by Lender, certify in writing that Borrowers
have carefully examined those portions of such Disclosure Document, pertaining
to Borrowers, the Property Manager and the Loan, and that such portions do not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (b) indemnify (in
a separate instrument of indemnity, if so requested by Lender) (i) any
underwriter, syndicate member or placement agent (collectively, the
"UNDERWRITERS") retained by Lender or its issuing company affiliate (the
"ISSUER") in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction, (ii) Lender and
(iii) the Issuer that is named in the Disclosure Document or registration
statement relating to a Secondary Market Transaction (the "REGISTRATION
STATEMENT"), and each of the Issuer's directors, each of its officers who have
signed the Registration Statement and each person or entity who controls the
Issuer or the Lender within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 30 of the Exchange Act (collectively within (iii), the "CITIGROUP
GROUP"), and each of its directors and each person who controls each of the
Underwriters, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section
20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "UNDERWRITER GROUP") for any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (the "LIABILITIES") to which Lender, the
Citigroup Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject (including
reimbursing all of them for any legal or other expenses actually incurred in
connection with investigating or defending the Liabilities) insofar as the
Liabilities arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement of any material
fact contained in any of the Provided Information or in any of the applicable
portions of such sections of the Disclosure Document applicable to Borrowers,
Manager, the Property or the Loan, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the
applicable portions of such sections or necessary in order to make the
statements in the applicable portions of such sections in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that Borrowers shall not be required to indemnify Lender for any Liabilities
relating to (i) untrue statements or omissions which Borrowers identified to
Lender in writing at the time of Borrowers' examination of such Disclosure
Document or (ii) any information or document not provided to or certified by
Borrowers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
9.1.3, nothing contained herein shall impose liability upon Borrowers for any
losses, claims, damages or liability arising out of or based upon an untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any statement, report or document
provided to Lender on behalf of Borrowers by a party who is not an Affiliate of
a Borrower (a "THIRD PARTY REPORT"), unless Borrowers had actual knowledge at
the time Borrowers provided such statement, report or document to Lender that
such Third Party Report contains such untrue statement.

                9.1.4   BORROWER INDEMNITY REGARDING FILINGS. In connection with
filings under the Exchange Act, Borrowers shall (i) indemnify Lender, the
Citigroup Group and the Underwriter Group for any Liabilities to which Lender,
the Citigroup Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as the
Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the omission to state in the Provided
Information a material fact required to be stated in the Provided Information in
order to make the statements in the Provided Information, in light of the

                                       67
<PAGE>

circumstances under which they were made not misleading and (ii) reimburse
Lender, the Citigroup Group or the Underwriter Group for any legal or other
expenses actually incurred by Lender, Citigroup Group or the Underwriter Group
in connection with defending or investigating the Liabilities. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.1.4, nothing contained
herein shall impose liability upon Borrowers for any Liabilities arising out of
or based upon an untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Third
Party Report, unless Borrowers had actual knowledge at the time Borrowers
provided such statement, report or document to Lender that such Third Party
Report contains such untrue statement.

                9.1.5   INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under Section 9.1.3 or 9.1.4 of notice of the commencement of
any action for which a claim for indemnification is to be made against
Borrowers, such indemnified party shall notify Borrowers in writing of such
commencement, but the omission to so notify Borrowers will not relieve Borrowers
from any liability that they may have to any indemnified party hereunder except
to the extent that failure to notify causes prejudice to Borrowers. If any
action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies Borrowers of
the commencement thereof, Borrowers will be entitled, jointly with any other
indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it (or they)
may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after
receiving the aforesaid notice of commencement, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party in its discretion. After
notice from Borrowers to such indemnified party under this Section 9.1.5,
Borrowers shall not be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in
any such action include both Borrowers and an indemnified party, and any
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to Borrowers, then the indemnified party
or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal
defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of
such indemnified party or parties. Borrowers shall not be liable for the
expenses of more than one separate counsel unless there are legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to
another indemnified party.

                9.1.6   CONTRIBUTION. In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in
Section 9.1.3 or 9.1.4 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any Liabilities (or action in respect thereof)
referred to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 9.1.3
or 9.1.4, Borrowers shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such Liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which the
respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered: (i)
the Citigroup Group's and Borrowers' relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted;
(ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii)
any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrowers hereby agree that it may not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

                                       68
<PAGE>

                9.1.7   SEVERANCE OF LOAN. Lender shall have the right, at any
time (whether prior to, in connection with, or after any Secondary Market
Transaction), with respect to all or any portion of the Loan, to modify, split
and/or sever all or any portion of the Loan as hereinafter provided. Without
limiting the foregoing, Lender may (i) cause the Note and the Mortgage to be
split into a first and second mortgage loan, (ii) create one more senior and
subordinate notes (I.E., an A/B or A/B/C structure), (iii) create multiple
components of the Note or Notes (and allocate or reallocate the principal
balance of the Loan among such components) or (iv) otherwise sever the Loan into
two or more loans secured by mortgages and by a pledge of partnership or
membership interests (directly or indirectly) in Borrowers (I.E., a senior
loan/mezzanine loan structure), in each such case, in whatever proportion and
whatever priority Lender determines; provided, however, in each such instance
the outstanding principal balance of all the Notes evidencing the Loan (or
components of such Notes) immediately after the effective date of such
modification equals the outstanding principal balance of the Loan immediately
prior to such modification and the weighted average of the interest rates for
all such Notes (or components of such Notes) immediately after the effective
date of such modification equals the interest rate of the original Note
immediately prior to such modification. If requested by Lender, Borrowers (and
Borrowers' constituent members, if applicable, and Guarantor) shall execute
within seven (7) Business Days after such request, such documentation as Lender
may reasonably request to evidence and/or effectuate any such modification or
severance.

        9.2     COSTS AND EXPENSES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article 9, Borrowers shall not be required to incur
out-of-pocket expenses in the performance of their obligations under Sections
9.1.1 (other than with respect to the delivery or update of non-consolidation
opinions), 9.1.2 and clause (a) of Section 9.1.3 and 9.1.7.

10.     MISCELLANEOUS

        10.1    EXCULPATION. (a) Subject to the qualifications below, Lender
shall not enforce the liability and obligation of any Borrower to perform and
observe the obligations contained in the Loan Documents by any action or
proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against such Borrower,
except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, an action for specific
performance or any other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to
enforce and realize upon its interest and rights under the Loan Documents, or in
the Property, the Rents or any other collateral given to Lender pursuant to the
Loan Documents; provided, however, that, except as specifically provided herein,
any judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable against a
Borrower only to the extent of such Borrower's interest in the Property, in the
Rents and in any other collateral given to Lender, and Lender shall not sue for,
seek or demand any deficiency judgment against a Borrower in any such action or
proceeding under or by reason of or under or in connection with any Loan
Document. The provisions of this Section shall not, however, (i) constitute a
waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or secured by any Loan
Document; (ii) impair the right of Lender to name one or more Borrowers as a
party defendant in any action or suit for foreclosure and sale under the
Mortgage; (iii) affect the validity or enforceability of any of the Loan
Documents or any guaranty made in connection with the Loan or any of the rights
and remedies of Lender thereunder; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the
appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the Assignment of
Leases; (vi) constitute a prohibition against Lender to commence any other
appropriate action or proceeding in order for Lender to fully realize the
security granted by the Mortgage or to

                                       69
<PAGE>

exercise its remedies against the Property; or (vii) constitute a waiver of the
right of Lender to enforce the liability and obligation of Borrowers, by money
judgment or otherwise, to the extent of any loss, damage, cost, expense,
liability, claim or other obligation incurred by Lender (including attorneys'
fees and costs reasonably incurred) (collectively, "LENDER'S LOSSES") arising
out of or in connection with the following (all such liability and obligation of
Borrower for any or all of the following being referred to herein as "BORROWERS'
RECOURSE LIABILITIES"): (a) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by any
Borrower, or Guarantor in connection with obtaining the Loan; (b) physical waste
of the Property or any portion thereof (other than acts committed by a third
party non-affiliated property manager), or after an Event of Default the removal
or disposal of any portion of the Property (other than acts committed by a third
party non-affiliated property manager); (c) any Proceeds paid by reason of any
Insured Casualty or any Award received in connection with a Condemnation or
other sums or payments attributable to the Property not applied in accordance
with the provisions of the Loan Documents (other than acts committed by a third

not have the legal right, because of a bankruptcy, receivership or similar
judicial proceeding, to direct disbursement of such sums or payments); (d) all
Rents of the Property received or collected by or on behalf of any Borrower
after an Event of Default and not applied to payment of Principal and interest
due under the Note, and to the payment of actual and reasonable operating
expenses of the Property, as they become due or payable (other than acts
committed by a third party non-affiliated property manager) (except to the
extent that such application of such funds is prevented by bankruptcy,
receivership, or similar judicial proceeding in which such Borrower is legally
prevented from directing the disbursement of such sums); (e) misappropriation
(including failure to turn over to Lender on demand following an Event of
Default) of tenant security deposits and rents collected in advance, or of funds
held by any Borrower for the benefit of another party (other than acts committed
by a third party non-affiliated property manager); (f) the failure to pay Taxes,
provided Borrowers shall not be liable (A) to the extent funds to pay such
amounts are available in the Tax and Insurance Subaccount and Lender failed to
pay same or has elected not to pay the same pursuant to Section 3.3 or (B) Rents
are insufficient to yield sufficient funds to pay such amounts; (g) the breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or indemnification in any Loan
Document concerning Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, including
Sections 4.21 and 5.8, and clauses (viii) through (xi) of Section 5.30; (h) the
breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5.13 (other than a breach of any of
the covenants described in clauses (x) and (xxi) (with respect to unsecured
trade payables) set forth in the definition of "Special Purpose Bankruptcy
Remote Entity" on Schedule 5, if the same occurs as a result of the economic
performance of the Property); (i) any Borrower or any Guarantor of such Borrower
or any of their direct or indirect Affiliates taking any action or making any
omission intended or reasonably likely to hinder, delay, impair or prevent
Lender in or from enforcing any and all of its rights and remedies under or
pursuant to the Loan Documents or at law or in equity (unless the same is
brought in good faith and is determined in favor of such Borrower or Guarantor
pursuant to a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction); (j) the termination of the Management Agreement or the removal of
Behringer Harvard TIC Management Services, L.P. as property manager thereunder
without Lender's consent (provided that only the Borrower(s) that voted in favor
of such termination or removal shall be liable for such losses); or (k) subject
to the next succeeding sentence, the failure by any Borrower to consent to a
modification of the terms of the Loan after a minimum of other Borrowers
representing a collective 66% tenancy in common

<PAGE>

interest in the Property (as such percentage shall be automatically increased by
each percentage point by which the Behringer Minimum Tenant-in-Common Interest
exceeds 5%) have approved the same. For purposes of the foregoing clause (k),
Lender's Losses with respect to the occurrence of any event giving rise to such
matter (A) shall be deemed to be equal to any unpaid portion of the Debt that
remains outstanding after Lender completes its realization with respect to the
Property (and all of its other collateral for the Loan pursuant to any of the
Loan Documents) and applies the proceeds of such realization to the Debt and (B)
Lender's Losses with respect to any applicable Borrower shall be limited to an
amount equal to the product of (1) the original principal amount of the Loan and
(2) the applicable Borrower's respective undivided tenant in common interest in
the Property (expressed as a percentage).

        (b)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
any of the Loan Documents, (A) Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any
right which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of
the Debt or to require that all collateral shall continue to secure all of the
Debt in accordance with the Loan Documents, and (B) Lender's agreement not to
pursue personal liability of Borrowers as set forth above SHALL BECOME NULL AND
VOID and shall be of no further force and effect, and the Debt shall be fully
recourse to the applicable Borrower or Borrowers in an amount equal to the
greater of (x) Lender's Losses arising out of or in connection with the
following matters or (y) an amount equal to the product of (1) the unpaid
balance of the Debt and (2) the applicable Borrower's respective undivided
tenant in common interest in the Property (expressed as a percentage), in the
event that one or more of the following occurs (each, a "SPRINGING RECOURSE
EVENT"): (i) an Event of Default described in Section 8.1(d) shall have
occurred, (ii) the occurrence of any condition or event described in either
Section 8.1(f) (with respect to Borrowers only) or Section 8.1(g) (with respect
to Borrowers only) (each, an "INSOLVENCY ACTION") and, with respect to such
Insolvency Action described in Section 8.1(g), either any Borrower, Guarantor or
any Person owning an interest (directly or indirectly) in any Borrower, or
Guarantor consents to, aids, solicits, supports, or otherwise cooperates or
colludes to cause such Insolvency Action or fails to contest such Insolvency
Action, except in the event that any such party has a fiduciary or legal duty to
take such action, (iii) any involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is brought by any
Borrower or its Guarantor or any of such Borrower's or its Guarantor's
Affiliates against any other Borrower; (iv) if subsequent to the commencement of
any voluntary bankruptcy proceeding with respect to any Borrower, any
involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is brought by Lender against one or more
Borrowers and any Borrower or such Borrower's Guarantor files any motion
contesting the same; or (v) any Borrower, such Borrower's Guarantor or any
Affiliate of such Borrower brings or joins in any action or proceeding for the
partition of the Property or any portion thereof or interest therein.

        (c)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.1 or
in any Loan Document, Lender hereby agrees that (1) with respect to the matters
described in clauses (a) through (f), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of Borrowers'
Recourse Liabilities, each TIC Borrower shall be liable for its own acts, and no
TIC Borrower (or any other Borrower) shall be liable for such Borrowers'
Recourse Liabilities occasioned as a result of the acts of any other Borrower
(or property manager) and (2) with respect to the matters described clauses (i)
through (v) of the Springing Recourse Events, if any such Springing Recourse
Event is caused by one or more TIC Borrowers, then only such TIC Borrower or TIC
Borrowers (and such TIC Borrower's or TIC

                                       71
<PAGE>

Borrowers' Guarantor or Guarantors (as applicable)) shall have the liability set
forth in clause (b) above, and no other TIC Borrower (or any other Borrower)
shall be liable as a result of such matter.

        10.2    BROKERS AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS. Each Borrower hereby represents
that it has dealt with no financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement
agents, agents or finders in connection with the Loan, other than NorthMarq
Capital, Inc., whose fee shall be paid by Borrowers. Borrowers shall indemnify
and hold Lender harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees, whether incurred in connection with
enforcing this indemnity or defending claims of third parties) of any kind in
any way relating to or arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted
on behalf of Borrowers in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.
The provisions of this Section 10.2 shall survive the expiration and termination
of this Agreement and the repayment of the Debt.

        10.3    RETENTION OF SERVICER. Lender reserves the right to retain the
Servicer to act as its agent hereunder with such powers as are specifically
delegated to the Servicer by Lender, whether pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, any pooling and servicing agreement or similar agreement entered into
as a result of a Secondary Market Transaction, the Deposit Account Agreement or
otherwise, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Borrowers shall pay any reasonable fees and expenses of the Servicer in
connection with a release of the Property, assumption or modification of the
Loan, enforcement of the Loan Documents or any other action taken by Servicer
hereunder on behalf of Lender, to the extent such actions are permitted to be
taken pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, but only to the extent that
Borrowers are expressly required to pay such expenses pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to
the extent any matter described in this Agreement requires the consent or
approval of the special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement (or
other similar agreement) entered into in connection with a Securitization, such
special servicer shall be afforded a consent period for such matter equal to the
greater of (i) the period of time given to Lender hereunder within which to
consent or approve such matter, (ii) 15 Business Days (to the extent such 15
Business Day period is required under the terms of such pooling and servicing
agreement).

        10.4    SURVIVAL. This Agreement and all covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made herein and in the certificates delivered
pursuant hereto shall survive the making by Lender of the Loan and the execution
and delivery to Lender of the Note, and shall continue in full force and effect
so long as any of the Debt is unpaid or such longer period if expressly set
forth in this Agreement. All Borrowers' covenants and agreements in this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the respective legal representatives,
successors and assigns of Lender.

        10.5    LENDER'S DISCRETION. Whenever pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, Lender exercises any right given to it to approve or
disapprove, or consent or withhold consent, or any arrangement or term is to be
satisfactory to Lender or is to be in Lender's discretion, the decision of
Lender to approve or disapprove, to consent or withhold consent, or to decide
whether arrangements or terms are satisfactory or not satisfactory, or
acceptable or unacceptable or in Lender's discretion shall (except as is
otherwise specifically herein provided) be in the sole discretion of Lender and
shall be final and conclusive.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM TO ASSERT THAT THE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION
GOVERNS THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTE, AND THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTE SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
PURSUANT TO ss. 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW.

                (b)     ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST LENDER OR
ANY BORROWER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INSTITUTED IN
ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK AND EACH BORROWER WAIVES

        10.7    MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING. No modification, amendment,
extension, discharge, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or of any other Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by any Borrower
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in a writing
signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance, and for the purpose,
for which given. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to or
demand on any Borrower shall entitle any Borrower to any other or future notice
or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. Neither any failure nor
any delay on the part of Lender in insisting upon strict performance of any
term, condition, covenant or agreement, or exercising any right, power, remedy
or privilege hereunder, or under any other Loan Document, shall operate as or
constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of any other right, power,
remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of limitation, by accepting
payment after the due date of any amount payable under any Loan Document, Lender
shall not be deemed to have waived any right either to require prompt payment
when due of all other amounts due under the Loan Documents, or to declare an
Event of Default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

        10.8    TRIAL BY JURY. EACH BORROWER AND LENDER HEREBY AGREE NOT TO
ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS
GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY EACH BORROWER AND LENDER, AND IS INTENDED TO
ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EITHER PARTY IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE
A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER
BY THE OTHER.

        10.9    HEADINGS/EXHIBITS. The Section headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Agreement for any other purpose. The Exhibits attached hereto, are
hereby incorporated by reference as a part of the Agreement with the same force
and effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

        10.10   SEVERABILITY. Wherever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

                                       74
<PAGE>

        10.11   PREFERENCES. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply any and
all payments by Borrowers to any portion of the Debt. To the extent Borrowers
make a payment to Lender, or Lender receives proceeds of any collateral, which
is in whole or part subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the
Debt or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in
full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by
Lender. This provision shall survive the expiration or termination of this
Agreement and the repayment of the Debt.

        10.12   WAIVER OF NOTICE. No Borrower shall be entitled to any notices
of any nature whatsoever from Lender except with respect to matters for which
this Agreement or any other Loan Document specifically and expressly requires
the giving of notice by Lender to such Borrower and except with respect to
matters for which such Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal
Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of notice. Each Borrower hereby
expressly waives the right to receive any notice from Lender with respect to any
matter for which no Loan Document specifically and expressly requires the giving
of notice by Lender to such Borrower.

        10.13   REMEDIES OF BORROWER. If a claim or adjudication is made that
Lender or any of its agents, including Servicer, has acted unreasonably or
unreasonably delayed acting in any case where by law or under any Loan Document,
Lender or any such agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act
reasonably or promptly, Borrowers agree that neither Lender nor its agents,
including Servicer, shall be liable for any monetary damages, and Borrowers'
sole remedy shall be to commence an action seeking injunctive relief or
declaratory judgment. Any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has
acted reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment.
Each Borrower specifically waives any claim against Lender and its agents,
including Servicer, with respect to actions taken by Lender or its agents on
Borrowers' behalf.

        10.14   PRIOR AGREEMENTS. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements,
understandings and negotiations among or between such parties, whether oral or
written, are superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

        10.15   OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES. Each Borrower hereby waives
the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any
action or proceeding brought against one or more Borrowers by Lender or its
agents, including Servicer, or otherwise offset any obligations to make payments
required under the Loan Documents. Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to
the Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which one or more Borrowers may otherwise have
(including with respect to any Future Funding Obligation or any default or
dispute relating thereto) against any assignor of such documents, and no such
offset, counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by one or more
Borrowers in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee

                                       75
<PAGE>

upon such documents, and any such right to interpose or assert any such offset,
counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly
waived by Borrowers.

        10.16   PUBLICITY. All news releases, publicity or advertising by any
Borrower or its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general
public, which refers to the Loan Documents, the Loan, Lender or any member of
the Citigroup Group, a Loan purchaser, the Servicer or the trustee in a
Secondary Market Transaction, shall be subject to the prior written approval of
Lender; provided however, that Lender's consent shall not be required by any
Borrower, Borrower's Affiliates, or any broker dealer or investor representative
related to the marketing or sale of any investment fund or investment trust
managed by Borrower's Affiliates which disclosure is required under the
Securities Act of 1933 or 1934 or to any potential purchaser of an interest in
the Property. Lender shall have the right to issue any of the foregoing without
any Borrower's approval.

        10.17   NO USURY. Borrowers and Lender intend at all times to comply
with applicable state law or applicable United States federal law (to the extent
that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a
greater amount of interest than under state law) and that this Section 10.17
shall control every other agreement in the Loan Documents. If the applicable law
(state or federal) is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any
amount called for under the Note or any other Loan Document, or contracted for,
charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to the Debt, or if Lender's
exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity of the Loan or any prepayment
by Borrowers results in Borrowers having paid any interest in excess of that
permitted by applicable law, then it is Borrowers' and Lender's express intent
that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender shall be credited
against the unpaid Principal and all other Debt (or, if the Debt has been or
would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrowers), and the provisions of the
Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter
collectible thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any
new document, so as to comply with applicable law, but so as to permit the
recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for thereunder. All sums paid or
agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the Loan
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Debt does not
exceed the maximum lawful rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the
Debt for so long as the Debt is outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, it is not the intention of Lender to
accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such
acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration.

        10.18   CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the other Loan
Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The parties hereto
acknowledge that each is represented by separate counsel in connection with the
negotiation and drafting of the Loan Documents and that the Loan Documents shall
not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party
that drafted them.

        10.19   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The Loan Documents are solely for
the benefit of Lender and Borrowers and nothing contained in any Loan Document
shall be deemed to confer

                                       76
<PAGE>

upon anyone other than the Lender and Borrowers any right to insist upon or to
enforce the performance or observance of any of the obligations contained
therein.

        10.20   YIELD MAINTENANCE PREMIUM. Borrowers acknowledge that (a) Lender
is making the Loan in consideration of the receipt by Lender of all interest and
other benefits intended to be conferred by the Loan Documents and (b) if
payments of Principal are made to Lender prior to the Stated Maturity Date, for
any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary, as a result of Lender's acceleration
of the Loan after an Event of Default, by operation of law or otherwise, Lender
will not receive all such interest and other benefits and may, in addition,
incur costs. For these reasons, and to induce Lender to make the Loan, Borrowers
agree that, except as expressly provided in Section 7, all prepayments, if any,
whether voluntary or involuntary, will be accompanied by the Yield Maintenance
Premium. Such Yield Maintenance Premium shall be required whether payment is
made by one or more Borrowers, by a Person on behalf of one or more Borrowers,
or by the purchaser at any foreclosure sale, and may be included in any bid by
Lender at such sale. Borrowers further acknowledge that (A) they are
knowledgeable real estate developers and/or investors; (B) they fully understand
the effect of the provisions of this Section 10.20, as well as the other
provisions of the Loan Documents; (C) the making of the Loan by Lender at the
Interest Rate and other terms set forth in the Loan Documents are sufficient
consideration for Borrowers' obligation to pay a Yield Maintenance Premium (if
required); and (D) Lender would not make the Loan on the terms set forth herein
without the inclusion of such provisions. Borrowers also acknowledge that the
provisions of this Agreement limiting the right of prepayment and providing for
the payment of the Yield Maintenance Premium and other charges specified herein
were independently negotiated and bargained for, and constitute a specific
material part of the consideration given by Borrowers to Lender for the making
of the Loan except as expressly permitted hereunder.

        10.21   ASSIGNMENT. The Loan, the Note, the Loan Documents and/or
Lender's rights, title, obligations and interests therein may be assigned by
Lender and any of its successors and assigns to any Person at any time in its
discretion, in whole or in part, whether by operation of law (pursuant to a
merger or other successor in interest) or otherwise. Upon such assignment, all
references to Lender in this Loan Agreement and in any Loan Document shall be
deemed to refer to such assignee or successor in interest and such assignee or
successor in interest shall thereafter stand in the place of Lender. No Borrower
may assign its rights, title, interests or obligations under this Loan Agreement
or under any of the Loan Documents.

        10.22   BORROWERS' DESIGNEE. Each of the Borrowers hereby authorizes,
designates and directs Borrowers' Designee to give Lender directions of any
kind, to take the actions or make such deliveries specified herein to be taken
or delivered by Borrowers' Designee (including under Sections 5.11, 6.3 and 9.1,
and including with respect to any requisitions from any reserve accounts under
Article 3) and to give and receive notices of any kind on behalf of such
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Any notice
given by Lender to Borrowers' Designee shall be deemed to have been given to
each and every Borrower.

        10.23   INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

        10.24   JOINT AND SEVERAL. Except to the extent expressly provided
otherwise in the Loan Documents, each of the Borrowers shall be jointly and
severally liable for payment of the Debt

                                       77
<PAGE>

and performance of all other obligations of Borrowers (or any of them) under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

        10.25   SET-OFF. IN ADDITION TO ANY RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF LENDER
PROVIDED BY THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND BY LAW, LENDER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT, WITHOUT
PRIOR NOTICE TO ANY BORROWER, ANY SUCH NOTICE BEING EXPRESSLY WAIVED BY EACH
BORROWER TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UPON ANY AMOUNT BECOMING DUE
AND PAYABLE BY ANY BORROWER HEREUNDER (WHETHER AT THE STATED MATURITY, BY
ACCELERATION OR OTHERWISE) TO SET-OFF AND APPROPRIATE AND APPLY AGAINST SUCH
AMOUNT ANY AND ALL DEPOSITS (GENERAL OR SPECIAL, TIME OR DEMAND, PROVISIONAL OR
FINAL), IN ANY CURRENCY, AND ANY OTHER CREDITS, INDEBTEDNESS OR CLAIMS, IN ANY
CURRENCY, IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT, ABSOLUTE OR CONTINGENT,
MATURED OR UNMATURED, AT ANY TIME HELD OR OWING BY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE
THEREOF TO OR FOR THE CREDIT OR THE ACCOUNT OF BORROWERS. LENDER AGREES PROMPTLY
TO NOTIFY BORROWERS AFTER ANY SUCH SET-OFF AND APPLICATION MADE BY LENDER;
PROVIDED THAT THE FAILURE TO GIVE SUCH NOTICE SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF
SUCH SET-OFF AND APPLICATION.

        10.26   1031 EXCHANGE. Borrowers acknowledge that they have established
a tenancy in common ownership structure for the Property in order to, among
other things, obtain certain tax benefits afforded under the provisions of
Section 1031 of the Code. Each Borrower expressly acknowledges that, together
with its own professional advisors and legal counsel, it has performed its own
due diligence and legal analysis relating to a tenancy in common ownership
structure and to the financial, tax, legal and other issues as it had deemed
necessary or appropriate to make an informed investment decision to purchase a
tenancy in common interest in the Property. Each Borrower expressly acknowledges
that Lender has not acted in any way whatsoever as an advisor to any Borrower
with respect to the foregoing and agrees that Lender shall have no
responsibility or express or implied liability whatsoever with respect to any of
the foregoing.

        10.27   COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

address at 388 Greenwich Street, Floor 11, New York, New York 10013.

        Trustor and Beneficiary have entered into a Loan Agreement dated as of

from time to time, the "LOAN AGREEMENT") pursuant to which Beneficiary is making
a secured loan to Trustor in the maximum principal amount of up to Thirty-Seven
Million and No/Dollars ($37,000,000) (the "LOAN"). Capitalized terms used herein
without definition are used as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan is
evidenced by a Note dated the date hereof made by Trustor to Beneficiary in such
principal amount (as the same may be amended, modified, restated, severed,
consolidated, renewed, replaced, or supplemented from time to time, the "NOTE").

        Trustor is the owner of fee simple title to certain parcels of real

located thereon (the "IMPROVEMENTS").

        To secure the payment of the Note and all sums which may or shall become
due thereunder or under any of the other documents evidencing, securing or
executed in connection with the Loan (the Note, this Deed of Trust, the Loan
Agreement and such other documents, as any of the same may, from time to time,
be modified, amended or supplemented, being hereinafter collectively referred to
as the "LOAN DOCUMENTS"), including (i) the payment of interest and other
amounts which would accrue and become due but for the filing of a petition in
bankruptcy (whether or not a claim is allowed against Trustor for such interest
or other amounts in any such bankruptcy proceeding) or the operation of the
automatic stay under Section 362(a) of Title 11 of the United States Code (the
"BANKRUPTCY CODE"), and (ii) the costs and expenses of enforcing any provision
of any Loan Document (all such sums being hereinafter collectively referred to
as the "DEBT"), Trustor has given, granted, bargained, sold, alienated,
enfeoffed, conveyed, confirmed, warranted, pledged, assigned and hypothecated
and by these presents does hereby give, grant, bargain, sell, alien, enfeoff,
convey, confirm, warrant, pledge, assign and hypothecate unto Trustee in trust
for the benefit of Beneficiary, WITH POWER OF SALE, the Premises and the
Improvements;

Code), purchase options or other similar rights afforded to any tenant in common
under the Tenant in Common Agreement; and

        (i)     all proceeds, products, offspring, rents and profits from any of

Deed of Trust shall automatically extend to all Rents acquired by the Trustor
after the commencement of the case and shall constitute cash collateral under
Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

        TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Trust Property unto and to the use and benefit
of Beneficiary and its successors and assigns, forever;

        PROVIDED, HOWEVER, these presents are upon the express condition that,
if Trustor shall well and truly pay to Beneficiary the Debt at the time and in
the manner provided in the Loan Documents and shall well and truly abide by and
comply with each and every covenant

                                       3
<PAGE>

and condition set forth in the Loan Documents in a timely manner, these presents
and the estate hereby granted shall cease, terminate and be void;

        AND Trustor represents and warrants to and covenants and agrees with
Beneficiary as follows:

                           PART I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

        1.      PAYMENT OF DEBT AND INCORPORATION OF COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND
AGREEMENTS. Trustor shall pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided in
the Loan Documents. All the covenants, conditions and agreements contained in
the Loan Documents are hereby made a part of this Deed of Trust to the same
extent and with the same force as if fully set forth herein. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Trustor (i) agrees to insure, repair, maintain
and restore damage to the Trust Property, pay Taxes and Other Charges, and
comply with Legal Requirements, in accordance with the Loan Agreement, and (ii)
agrees that the Proceeds of Insurance and Awards for Condemnation shall be
settled, held and applied in accordance with the Loan Agreement.

        2.      LEASES AND RENTS.

        (a)     Trustor does hereby absolutely and unconditionally assign to
Beneficiary all of Trustor's right, title and interest in all current and future
Leases and Rents, it being intended by Trustor that this assignment constitutes
a present, absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security
only. Such assignment shall not be construed to bind Beneficiary to the
performance of any of the covenants or provisions contained in any Lease or
otherwise impose any obligation upon Beneficiary. Nevertheless, subject to the
terms of this paragraph, Beneficiary grants to Trustor a revocable license to
operate and manage the Trust Property and to collect the Rents subject to the
requirements of the Loan Agreement (including the deposit of Rents into the
Clearing Account). Upon an Event of Default, without the need for notice or
demand, the license granted to Trustor herein shall automatically be revoked,
and Beneficiary shall immediately be entitled to possession of all Rents in the
Clearing Account, the Deposit Account (including all Subaccounts thereof) and
all Rents collected thereafter (including Rents past due and unpaid), whether or
not Beneficiary enters upon or takes control of the Trust Property. Trustor
hereby grants and assigns to Beneficiary the right, at its option, upon
revocation of the license granted herein, to enter upon the Trust Property in
person, by agent or by court-appointed receiver to collect the Rents. Unless
prohibited by applicable law, any Rents collected after the revocation of such
license may be applied toward payment of the Debt in such priority and
proportions as Beneficiary in its sole discretion shall deem proper.

        (b)     Trustor shall not enter into, modify, amend, cancel, terminate
or renew any Lease except as provided in Section 5.10 of the Loan Agreement.

        3.      USE OF TRUST PROPERTY. Trustor shall not initiate, join in,
acquiesce in or consent to any change in any private restrictive covenant,
zoning law or other public or private restriction, limiting or defining the uses
which may be made of the Trust Property. If under applicable zoning provisions
the use of the Trust Property is or shall become a nonconforming use, Trustor
shall not cause or permit such nonconforming use to be discontinued or abandoned

                                       4
<PAGE>

without the consent of Beneficiary. Trustor shall not (i) change the use of the
Trust Property, (ii) permit or suffer to occur any waste on or to the Trust
Property or (iii) take any steps to convert the Trust Property to a condominium
or cooperative form of ownership.

        4.      TRANSFER OR ENCUMBRANCE OF THE TRUST PROPERTY.

        (a)     Trustor acknowledges that (i) Beneficiary has examined and
relied on the creditworthiness and experience of the principals of Trustor in
owning and operating properties such as the Trust Property in agreeing to make
the Loan, (ii) Beneficiary will continue to rely on Trustor's ownership of the
Trust Property as a means of maintaining the value of the Trust Property as
security for the Debt, and (iii) Beneficiary has a valid interest in maintaining
the value of the Trust Property so as to ensure that, should Trustor default in
the repayment of the Debt, Beneficiary can recover the Debt by a sale of the
Trust Property. Trustor shall not sell, convey, alienate, Deed of Trust,
encumber, pledge or otherwise transfer the Trust Property or any part thereof,
or suffer or permit any Transfer to occur, other than a Permitted Transfer.

        (b)     Beneficiary shall not be required to demonstrate any actual
impairment of its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in order
to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon Transfer in violation of
this Paragraph 4. This provision shall apply to every sale, conveyance,
alienation, Deed of Trust, encumbrance, pledge or transfer of the Trust Property
(and every other Transfer) regardless of whether voluntary or not. Any Transfer
made in contravention of this Paragraph 4 shall be null and void and of no force
and effect. Trustor agrees to bear and shall pay or reimburse Beneficiary on
demand for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, title search costs and title insurance endorsement premiums)
incurred by Beneficiary in connection with the review, approval and
documentation of any Permitted Transfer.

        5.      CHANGES IN LAWS REGARDING TAXATION. If any law is enacted or
adopted or amended after the date of this Deed of Trust which deducts the Debt
from the value of the Trust Property for the purpose of taxation or which
imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on the Debt or Beneficiary's
interest in the Trust Property, Trustor will pay such tax, with interest and
penalties thereon, if any. If Beneficiary is advised by its counsel that the
payment of such tax or interest and penalties by Trustor would be unlawful,
taxable to Beneficiary or unenforceable, or would provide the basis for a
defense of usury, then Beneficiary shall have the option, by notice of not less
than 90 days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable.

        6.      NO CREDITS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEBT. Trustor shall not claim or
demand or be entitled to any credit on account of the Debt for any part of the
Taxes or Other Charges assessed against the Trust Property, and no deduction
shall otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Trust Property
for real estate tax purposes by reason of this Deed of Trust or the Debt. If
such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, Beneficiary shall have
the option, by notice of not less than 90 days, to declare the Debt immediately
due and payable.

        7.      FURTHER ACTS, ETC. Trustor shall, at its sole cost, do execute,
acknowledge and deliver all and every such further acts, deeds, conveyances,
mortgages, assignments, notices of assignment, transfers and assurances as
Beneficiary shall, from time to

                                       5
<PAGE>

time, require, for the better assuring, conveying, assigning, transferring, and
confirming unto Beneficiary the property and rights hereby mortgaged, given,
granted, bargained, sold, alienated, enfeoffed, conveyed, confirmed, pledged,
assigned and hypothecated or intended now or hereafter so to be, or which
Trustor may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to Beneficiary,
or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of the terms
of this Deed of Trust, or for filing, registering or recording this Deed of
Trust or for facilitating the sale and transfer of the Loan and the Loan
Documents in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction as described in
Section 9.1 of the Loan Agreement. Upon foreclosure, the appointment of a
receiver or any other relevant action, Trustor shall, at its sole cost,
cooperate fully and completely to effect the assignment or transfer of any
license, permit, agreement or any other right necessary or useful to the
operation of the Trust Property. Trustor grants to Beneficiary an irrevocable
power of attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose of exercising and
perfecting any and all rights and remedies available to Beneficiary at law and
in equity, including such rights and remedies available to Beneficiary pursuant
to this paragraph. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately
preceding sentence, Beneficiary shall not execute any document as
attorney-in-fact of Trustor unless (x) Trustor shall have failed or refused to
execute the same within five (5) Business Days after Beneficiary's request
therefor, or (y) in Beneficiary's good faith determination it would be
materially prejudiced by the delay involved in making such a request.
Beneficiary shall give prompt notice to Trustor of any exercise of the power of
attorney as provided for in this Paragraph 7, along with copies of all documents
executed in connection therewith.

        8.      RECORDING OF DEED OF TRUST, ETC. Trustor forthwith upon the
execution and delivery of this Deed of Trust and thereafter, from time to time,
shall cause this Deed of Trust, and any security instrument creating a lien or
security interest or evidencing the lien hereof upon the Trust Property and each
instrument of further assurance to be filed, registered or recorded in such
manner and in such places as may be required by any present or future law in
order to publish notice of and fully to protect the lien or security interest
hereof upon, and the interest of Beneficiary in, the Trust Property. Trustor
shall pay all filing, registration or recording fees, all expenses incident to
the preparation, execution and acknowledgment of and all federal, state, county
and municipal, taxes, duties, imposts, documentary stamps, assessments and
charges arising out of or in connection with the execution and delivery of, this
Deed of Trust, any Deed of Trust supplemental hereto, any security instrument
with respect to the Trust Property or any instrument of further assurance,
except where prohibited by law so to do. Trustor shall hold harmless and
indemnify Beneficiary, its successors and assigns, against any liability
incurred by reason of the imposition of any tax on the making or recording of
this Deed of Trust.

        9.      RIGHT TO CURE DEFAULTS. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default, Beneficiary may, but without any obligation to do so and without notice
to or demand on Trustor and without releasing Trustor from any obligation
hereunder, perform the obligations in Default in such manner and to such extent
as Beneficiary may deem necessary to protect the security hereof. Beneficiary is
authorized to enter upon the Trust Property for such purposes or appear in,
defend or bring any action or proceeding to protect its interest in the Trust
Property or to foreclose this Deed of Trust or collect the Debt, and the cost
and expense thereof (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements to
the extent permitted by law), with interest thereon at the Default Rate for the
period after notice from Beneficiary that such cost or expense

                                       6
<PAGE>

was incurred to the date of payment to Beneficiary, shall constitute a portion
of the Debt, shall be secured by this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents
and shall be due and payable to Beneficiary upon demand.

        10.     REMEDIES.

        (a)     Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Beneficiary may
take such action, without notice or demand, as it deems advisable to protect and
enforce its rights against Trustor and in and to the Trust Property, by
Beneficiary itself or otherwise, including the following actions, each of which
may be pursued concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Beneficiary may determine, in its sole discretion, without impairing or
otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Beneficiary:

                (i)     declare the entire Debt to be immediately due and
        payable;

                (ii)    give such notice of default and of election to cause the
        Trust Property to be sold as may be required by law or as may be
        necessary to cause Beneficiary to exercise the power of sale granted
        herein; Beneficiary shall then record and give such notice of
        Beneficiary's sale as then required by law and, after the expiration of
        such time as may be required by law, may sell the Trust Property at the
        time and place specified in the notice of sale, as a whole or in
        separate parcels as directed by Beneficiary, or by Trustor to the extent
        required by law, at public auction to the highest bidder for cash in
        lawful money of the United States, payable at time of sale, all in
        accordance with applicable law. Beneficiary, from time to time, may
        postpone or continue the sale of all or any portion of the Trust
        Property by public declaration at the time and place last appointed for
        the sale and no other notice of the postponed sale shall be required
        unless provided by applicable law. Upon any sale, Beneficiary shall
        deliver its deed conveying the property sold, without any covenant or
        warranty, expressed or implied, to the purchaser or purchasers at the
        sale. The recitals in such deed of any matters or facts shall be
        conclusive as to the accuracy thereof;

                (iii)   institute a proceeding or proceedings, judicial or
        nonjudicial, to the extent permitted by law, by advertisement, by action
        or otherwise, for the complete foreclosure of this Deed of Trust, in
        which case the Trust Property may be sold for cash or upon credit in one
        or more parcels or in several interests or portions and in any order or
        manner;

                (iv)    with or without entry, to the extent permitted and
        pursuant to the procedures provided by applicable law, institute
        proceedings for the partial foreclosure of this Deed of Trust for the
        portion of the Debt then due and payable, subject to the continuing lien
        of this Deed of Trust for the balance of the Debt not then due;

                (v)     sell for cash or upon credit the Trust Property and all
        estate, claim, demand, right, title and interest of Trustor therein and
        rights of redemption thereof, pursuant to the power of sale, to the
        extent permitted by law, or

                                       7

        otherwise, at one or more sales, as an entirety or in parcels, at such
        time and place, upon such terms and after such notice thereof as may be
        required or permitted by law;

                (vi)    institute an action, suit or proceeding in equity for
        the specific performance of any covenant, condition or agreement
        contained herein or in any other Loan Document;

                (vii)   recover judgment on the Note either before, during or
        after any proceeding for the enforcement of this Deed of Trust;

                (viii)  apply for the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
        liquidator or conservator of the Trust Property, without notice and
        without regard for the adequacy of the security for the Debt and without
        regard for the solvency of the Trustor or of any person, firm or other
        entity liable for the payment of the Debt;

                (ix)    enforce Beneficiary's interest in the Leases and Rents
        and enter into or upon the Trust Property, either personally or by its
        agents, nominees or attorneys and dispossess Trustor and its agents and
        employees therefrom, and thereupon Beneficiary may (A) use, operate,
        manage, control, insure, maintain, repair, restore and otherwise deal
        with the Trust Property and conduct the business thereat; (B) complete
        any construction on the Trust Property in such manner and form as
        Beneficiary deems advisable; (C) make alterations, additions, renewals,
        replacements and improvements to or on the Trust Property; (D) exercise
        all rights and powers of Trustor with respect to the Trust Property,
        whether in the name of Trustor or otherwise, including the right to
        make, cancel, enforce or modify Leases, obtain and evict tenants, and
        demand, sue for, collect and receive Rents; and (E) unless prohibited by
        applicable law, apply the receipts from the Trust Property to the
        payment of the Debt, after deducting therefrom all expenses (including
        reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred in connection
        with the aforesaid operations and all amounts necessary to pay the
        Taxes, insurance and other charges in connection with the Trust
        Property, as well as just and reasonable compensation for the services
        of Beneficiary, and its counsel, agents and employees;

                (x)     require Trustor to pay monthly in advance to
        Beneficiary, or any receiver appointed to collect the Rents, the fair
        and reasonable rental value for the use and occupation of any portion of

        and surrender possession of the Trust Property to Beneficiary or to such
        receiver, and, in default thereof, evict Trustor by summary proceedings
        or otherwise; or

                (xi)    pursue such other rights and remedies as may be
        available at law or in equity or under the UCC, including the right to
        receive and/or establish a lock box for all Rents and proceeds from the
        Intangibles and any other receivables or rights to payments of Trustor
        relating to the Trust Property.

<PAGE>

In the event of a sale, by foreclosure or otherwise, of less than all of the
Trust Property, this Deed of Trust shall continue as a lien on the remaining
portion of the Trust Property.

                (b)     The proceeds of any sale made under or by virtue of this
Paragraph 10, together with any other sums which then may be held by Beneficiary
under this Deed of Trust, whether under the provisions of this paragraph or
otherwise, shall be applied by Beneficiary to the payment of the Debt in such
priority and proportion as Beneficiary in its sole discretion shall deem proper.

                (c)     Beneficiary may adjourn from time to time any sale by it
to be made under or by virtue of this Deed of Trust by announcement at the time
and place appointed for such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales; and,
except as otherwise provided by any applicable law, Beneficiary, without further
notice or publication, may make such sale at the time and place to which the
same shall be so adjourned.

                (d)     Upon the completion of any sale or sales pursuant
hereto, Beneficiary, or an officer of any court empowered to do so, shall
execute and deliver to the accepted purchaser or purchasers a good and
sufficient instrument, or good and sufficient instruments, conveying, assigning
and transferring all estate, right, title and interest in and to the property
and rights sold. Beneficiary is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful
attorney of Trustor, in its name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances,
assignments, transfers and deliveries of the Trust Property and rights so sold
and for that purpose Beneficiary may execute all necessary instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, and may substitute one or more persons with
like power, Trustor hereby ratifying and confirming all that its said attorney
or such substitute or substitutes shall lawfully do by virtue hereof. Any sale
or sales made under or by virtue of this Paragraph 10, whether made under the
power of sale herein granted or under or by virtue of judicial proceedings or of
a judgment or decree of foreclosure and sale, shall operate to divest all the
estate, right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever, whether at law or
in equity, of Trustor in and to the properties and rights so sold, and shall be
a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against Trustor and against any and
all persons claiming or who may claim the same, or any part thereof, from,
through or under Trustor.

                (e)     Upon any sale made under or by virtue of this Paragraph
10, whether made under a power of sale or under or by virtue of judicial
proceedings or of a judgment or decree of foreclosure and sale, Beneficiary may
bid for and acquire the Trust Property or any part thereof and in lieu of paying
cash therefor may make settlement for the purchase price by crediting upon the
Debt the net sales price after deducting therefrom the expenses of the sale and
costs of the action and any other sums which Beneficiary is authorized to deduct
under this Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document.

                (f)     No recovery of any judgment by Beneficiary and no levy
of an execution under any judgment upon the Trust Property or upon any other
property of Trustor shall affect in any manner or to any extent the lien of this
Deed of Trust upon the Trust Property or any part thereof, or any liens, rights,
powers or remedies of Beneficiary hereunder, but such liens, rights, powers and
remedies of Beneficiary shall continue unimpaired as before.

                                       9
<PAGE>

                (g)     Beneficiary may terminate or rescind any proceeding or
other action brought in connection with its exercise of the remedies provided in
this Paragraph 10 at any time before the conclusion thereof, as determined in
Beneficiary's sole discretion and without prejudice to Beneficiary.

                (h)     Beneficiary may resort to any remedies and the security
given by this Deed of Trust or in any other Loan Document in whole or in part,
and in such portions and in such order as determined by Beneficiary's sole
discretion. No such action shall in any way be considered a waiver of any
rights, benefits or remedies evidenced or provided by any Loan Document. The
failure of Beneficiary to exercise any right, remedy or option provided in any
Loan Document shall not be deemed a waiver of such right, remedy or option or of
any covenant or obligation secured by any Loan Document. No acceptance by
Beneficiary of any payment after the occurrence of any Event of Default and no
payment by Beneficiary of any obligation for which Trustor is liable hereunder
shall be deemed to waive or cure any Event of Default, or Trustor's liability to
pay such obligation. No sale of all or any portion of the Trust Property, no
forbearance on the part of Beneficiary, and no extension of time for the payment
of the whole or any portion of the Debt or any other indulgence given by
Beneficiary to Trustor, shall operate to release or in any manner affect the
interest of Beneficiary in the remaining Trust Property or the liability of
Trustor to pay the Debt. No waiver by Beneficiary shall be effective unless it
is in writing and then only to the extent specifically stated. All costs and
expenses of Beneficiary in exercising its rights and remedies under this
Paragraph 10 (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements to the
extent permitted by law), shall be paid by Trustor immediately upon notice from
Beneficiary, with interest at the Default Rate for the period after notice from
Beneficiary, and such costs and expenses shall constitute a portion of the Debt
and shall be secured by this Deed of Trust.

                (i)     The interests and rights of Beneficiary under the Loan
Documents shall not be impaired by any indulgence, including (i) any renewal,
extension or modification which Beneficiary may grant with respect to any of the
Debt, (ii) any surrender, compromise, release, renewal, extension, exchange or
substitution which Beneficiary may grant with respect to the Trust Property or
any portion thereof or (iii) any release or indulgence granted to any maker,
endorser, guarantor or surety of any of the Debt.

                11.     RIGHT OF ENTRY. In addition to any other rights or
remedies granted under this Deed of Trust, Beneficiary and its agents shall have
the right to enter and inspect the Trust Property at any reasonable time during
the term of this Deed of Trust. The cost of such inspections or audits shall be
borne by Trustor should Beneficiary determine that an Event of Default exists,
including the cost of all follow up or additional investigations or inquiries
deemed reasonably necessary by Beneficiary. The cost of such inspections, if not
paid for by Trustor following demand, may be added to the principal balance of
the sums due under the Note and this Deed of Trust and shall bear interest
thereafter until paid at the Default Rate.

                12.     SECURITY AGREEMENT.

                (a)     This Deed of Trust is both a real property Deed of Trust
and a "security agreement" within the meaning of the UCC. The Trust Property
includes both real and personal property and all other rights and interests,
whether tangible or intangible in nature, of Trustor in

                                       10
<PAGE>

the Trust Property. Trustor by executing and delivering this Deed of Trust has
granted and hereby grants to Beneficiary, as security for the Debt, a security
interest in the Trust Property to the full extent that the Trust Property may be
subject to the UCC (such portion of the Trust Property so subject to the UCC
being called in this paragraph the "COLLATERAL"). This Deed of Trust shall also
constitute a "fixture filing" for the purposes of the UCC. As such, this Deed of
Trust covers all items of the Collateral that are or are to become fixtures.
Information concerning the security interest herein granted may be obtained from
the parties at the addresses of the parties set forth in the first paragraph of
this Deed of Trust. If an Event of Default shall occur, Beneficiary, in addition
to any other rights and remedies which it may have, shall have and may exercise
immediately and without demand, any and all rights and remedies granted to a
secured party upon default under the UCC, including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the right to take possession of the Collateral or
any part thereof, and to take such other measures as Beneficiary may deem
necessary for the care, protection and preservation of the Collateral. Upon
request or demand of Beneficiary, Trustor shall at its expense assemble the
Collateral and make it available to Beneficiary at a convenient place acceptable
to Beneficiary. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary on demand any and all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by
Beneficiary in protecting the interest in the Collateral and in enforcing the
rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral. Any notice of sale, disposition
or other intended action by Beneficiary with respect to the Collateral, sent to
Trustor in accordance with the provisions hereof at least ten days prior to such
action, shall constitute commercially reasonable notice to Trustor. The proceeds
of any disposition of the Collateral, or any part thereof, may be applied by
Beneficiary to the payment of the Debt in such priority and proportions as
Beneficiary in its sole discretion shall deem proper. In the event of any change
in name, identity or structure of Trustor, Trustor shall notify Beneficiary
thereof and promptly after request shall execute, file and record such UCC forms
as are necessary to maintain the priority of Beneficiary's lien upon and
security interest in the Collateral, and shall pay all expenses and fees in
connection with the filing and recording thereof. If Beneficiary shall require
the filing or recording of additional UCC forms or continuation statements,
Trustor shall, promptly after request, execute, file and record such UCC forms
or continuation statements as Beneficiary shall deem necessary, and shall pay
all expenses and fees in connection with the filing and recording thereof, it
being understood and agreed, however, that no such additional documents shall
increase Trustor's obligations under the Loan Documents. Trustor hereby
irrevocably appoints Beneficiary as its attorney-in-fact, coupled with an
interest, to file with the appropriate public office on its behalf any financing
or other statements signed only by Beneficiary, as secured party, in connection
with the Collateral covered by this Deed of Trust.

                (b)     Trustor hereby absolutely and unconditionally pledges
and assigns to Beneficiary as additional security all of Trustor's right, title
and interest in, to and under the: (i) Tenant in Common Agreement, and (ii) the
Property and Asset Management Agreement ("MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT") among each
entity constituting Trustor and Behringer Harvard TIC Management Services LP
executed in connection with the Loan, (collectively, the "TENANCY IN COMMON
AGREEMENTS"); provided that Beneficiary shall have no obligation or liability
under any of the Tenancy In Common Agreements.

                13.     ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS. Beneficiary has the right to
appear in and defend any action or proceeding brought with respect to the Trust
Property and to bring any action or proceeding, in the name and on behalf of
Trustor, which Beneficiary, in its sole

                                       11
<PAGE>

discretion, decides should be brought to protect its or their interest in the
Trust Property. Beneficiary shall, at its option, be subrogated to the lien of
any deed of trust or other security instrument discharged in whole or in part by
the Debt, and any such subrogation rights shall constitute additional security
for the payment of the Debt.

                14.     MARSHALLING AND OTHER MATTERS. Trustor hereby waives, to
the extent permitted by law, the benefit of all homestead, appraisement,
valuation, stay, extension, reinstatement and redemption laws now or hereafter
in force and all rights of marshalling in the event of any sale hereunder of the
Trust Property or any part thereof or any interest therein. Further, Trustor
hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption from sale under any
order or decree of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust on behalf of Trustor, and
on behalf of each and every person acquiring any interest in or title to the
Trust Property subsequent to the date of this Deed of Trust and on behalf of all
persons to the extent permitted by applicable law. The lien of this Deed of
Trust shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not in any manner be
affected or impaired by any acts or omissions whatsoever of Beneficiary and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the lien hereof shall not be
impaired by (i) any acceptance by Beneficiary of any other security for any
portion of the Debt, (ii) any failure, neglect or omission on the part of
Beneficiary to realize upon or protect any portion of the Debt or any collateral
security therefor or (iii) any release (except as to the property released),
sale, pledge, surrender, compromise, settlement, renewal, extension, indulgence,
alteration, changing, modification or disposition of any portion of the Debt or
of any of the collateral security therefor; and Beneficiary may foreclose, or
exercise any other remedy available to Beneficiary under other Loan Documents
without first exercising or enforcing any of its remedies under this Deed of
Trust, and any exercise of the rights and remedies of Beneficiary hereunder
shall not in any manner impair the Debt or the liens of any other Loan Document
or any of Beneficiary's rights and remedies thereunder.

                15.     NOTICES. All notices, consents, approvals and requests
required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be sent, and
shall be deemed effective, as provided in the Loan Agreement.

                16.     INAPPLICABLE PROVISIONS. If any term, covenant or
condition of this Deed of Trust is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, this Deed of Trust shall be construed without such provision.

                17.     HEADINGS. The paragraph headings in this Deed of Trust
are for convenience of reference only and are not to be construed as defining or
limiting, in any way, the scope or intent of the provisions hereof.

                18.     DUPLICATE ORIGINALS. This Deed of Trust may be executed
in any number of duplicate originals and each such duplicate original shall be
deemed to be an original.

                19.     DEFINITIONS. Unless the context clearly indicates a
contrary intent or unless otherwise specifically provided herein, words used in
this Deed of Trust may be used interchangeably in singular or plural form; and
the word "TRUSTOR" shall mean "each Trustor and any subsequent owner or owners
of the Trust Property or any part thereof or any interest therein," the word
"BENEFICIARY" shall mean "Beneficiary and any subsequent holder of the

                                       12
<PAGE>

Note," the words "TRUST PROPERTY" shall include any portion of the Trust
Property and any interest therein, the word "INCLUDING" means "including but not
limited to" and the words "ATTORNEYS' FEES" shall include any and all attorneys'
fees, paralegal and law clerk fees, including fees at the pre-trial, trial and
appellate levels incurred or paid by Beneficiary in protecting its interest in
the Trust Property and Collateral and enforcing its rights hereunder.

                20.     HOMESTEAD. Trustor hereby waives and renounces all
homestead and exemption rights provided by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States and of any state, in and to the Trust Property as against the
collection of the Debt, or any part thereof.

                21.     ASSIGNMENTS. Beneficiary shall have the right to assign
or transfer its rights under this Deed of Trust without limitation. Any assignee
or transferee shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded Beneficiary under
this Deed of Trust.

                22.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TRUSTOR HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THIS DEED OF TRUST OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY
CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER
OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY TRUSTOR, AND IS
INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. BENEFICIARY IS HEREBY
AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE
EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY TRUSTOR.

                23.     CONSENTS. Any consent or approval by Beneficiary in any
single instance shall not be deemed or construed to be Beneficiary's consent or
approval in any like matter arising at a subsequent date, and the failure of
Beneficiary to promptly exercise any right, power, remedy, consent or approval
provided herein or at law or in equity shall not constitute or be construed as a
waiver of the same nor shall Beneficiary be estopped from exercising such right,
power, remedy, consent or approval at a later date. Any consent or approval
requested of and granted by Beneficiary pursuant hereto shall be narrowly
construed to be applicable only to Trustor and the matter identified in such
consent or approval and no third party shall claim any benefit by reason
thereof, and any such consent or approval shall not be deemed to constitute
Beneficiary a venturer or partner with Trustor nor shall privity of contract be
presumed to have been established with any such third party. If Beneficiary
deems it to be in its best interest to retain assistance of persons, firms or
corporations (including attorneys, title insurance companies, appraisers,
engineers and surveyors) with respect to a request for consent or approval,
Trustor shall reimburse Beneficiary for all costs reasonably incurred in
connection with the employment of such persons, firms or corporations.

                24.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN. During the term of this Deed of
Trust, unless Beneficiary shall have previously consented in writing, (i)
Trustor shall take no action that would cause it to become an "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLAN" as defined in 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, or "ASSETS OF A GOVERNMENTAL
PLAN" subject to regulation under the state statutes, and (ii) Trustor

                                       13
<PAGE>

shall not sell, assign or transfer the Trust Property, or any portion thereof or
interest therein, to any transferee that does not execute and deliver to
Beneficiary its written assumption of the obligations of this covenant. Trustor
shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold Beneficiary harmless from and against
all loss, cost, damage and expense (including all attorneys' fees, excise taxes
and costs of correcting any prohibited transaction or obtaining an appropriate
exemption) that Beneficiary may incur as a result of Trustor's breach of this
covenant. This covenant and indemnity shall survive the extinguishment of the
lien of this Deed of Trust by foreclosure or action in lieu thereof;
furthermore, the foregoing indemnity shall supersede any limitations on
Trustor's liability under any of the Loan Documents.

                25.     LOAN REPAYMENT AND DEFEASANCE. Provided no Event of
Default exists, this Deed of Trust will be satisfied and discharged of record by
Beneficiary prior to the Maturity Date only in accordance with the terms and
provisions set forth in the Loan Agreement.

                26.     GOVERNING LAW. THIS DEED OF TRUST SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE TRUST
PROPERTY IS LOCATED WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF.

                27.     EXCULPATION. The liability of Trustor hereunder is
limited pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Loan Agreement.

                28.     JOINT AND SEVERAL. Each Person constituting Trustor
hereunder shall have joint and several liability for the obligations of Trustor
hereunder except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents.

                29.     TRUSTEE; SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. Trustee shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or act done by Trustee, or be otherwise responsible or
accountable under any circumstances whatsoever, except if the result of
Trustee's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Trustee shall not be
personally liable in case of entry by him or anyone acting by virtue of the
powers herein granted him upon the Trust Property for debts contracted or
liability or damages or damages incurred in the management or operation of the
Trust Property. Trustee shall have the right to rely on any instrument, document
or signature authorizing or supporting any action taken or proposed to be taken
by him hereunder or believed by him to be genuine. Trustee shall be entitled to
reimbursement for actual expenses incurred by him in the performance of his
duties hereunder and to reasonable compensation for such of his services
hereunder as shall be rendered. Trustor will, from time to time, reimburse
Trustee for and save and hold him harmless from and against any and all loss,
cost, liability, damage and reasonable expense whatsoever incurred by him in the
performance of his duties. All monies received by Trustee shall, until used or
applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they
were received, but need not be segregated in any manner from any other monies
(except to the extent required by law) and Trustee shall be under no liability
for interest on any monies received by him hereunder. Trustee may resign by
giving of notice of such resignation in writing to Beneficiary. If Trustee shall
die, resign or become disqualified from acting in the execution of this trust or
shall fail or refuse to exercise the same when requested by Beneficiary or if
for any or no reason and without cause Beneficiary shall prefer to appoint a
substitute trustee to act instead of the original Trustee named herein, or any
prior successor or substitute trustee, Beneficiary shall, without any formality
or notice to Trustor or any other person, have full power

                                       14
<PAGE>

to appoint a substitute trustee and, if Beneficiary so elects, several
substitute trustees in succession who shall succeed to all the estate, rights,
powers and duties of the aforenamed Trustee. Each appointment and substitution
shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing which shall recite the parties
to, and the book and page of record of, this Deed of Trust, and the description
of the real property herein described, which instrument, executed and
acknowledged by Beneficiary, shall (i) be conclusive proof of the proper
substitution and appointment of such successor Trustee or Trustees, (ii) duly
assign and transfer all the estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts of
Trustee so ceasing to act and (iii) be notice of such proper substitution and
appointment to all parties in interest. In addition, such Trustee ceasing to act
shall duly assign, transfer, and deliver any of the property and monies held by
Trustee to the successor Trustee so appointed in its or his place. The Trustee
may act in the execution of this trust and may authorize one or more parties to
act on his behalf to perform the ministerial functions required of him
hereunder, including without limitation, the transmittal and posting of any
notices and it shall not be necessary for any Trustee to be present in person at
any foreclosure sale.

                30.     COUNTERPARTS. This Deed of Trust may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument.

<PAGE>

        THIS ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS (this "ASSIGNMENT") dated and
effective as of the ____ day of December, 2004 made by BEHRINGER HARVARD PRATT
H, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company having an address at 15601 Dallas
Parkway, Suite 600, Addison, Texas 75001, and those borrowers set forth on
Schedule 1 attached hereto (collectively, the "ASSIGNOR") to CITIGROUP GLOBAL
MARKETS REALTY CORP., a New York corporation (together with its successors and
assigns, hereinafter referred to as "ASSIGNEE"), having an address at 388
Greenwich Street, Floor 11, New York, New York 10013.

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

        WHEREAS, Assignor is the (i) owner of a fee simple title to that certain
parcel of real property (the "PREMISES") described in EXHIBIT A attached hereto,
together with the buildings, structures, fixtures, additions, enlargements,
extensions, modifications, repairs, replacements and other improvements now or
hereafter located thereon (collectively, the "PROPERTY");

        WHEREAS, Assignor and Assignee have entered into a certain Loan
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (as amended, modified, restated,
consolidated or supplemented from time to time, the "LOAN AGREEMENT") pursuant
to which Assignee has agreed to make a secured loan to Assignor in the maximum
principal amount of up to Thirty-Seven Million and No/Dollars ($37,000,000) (the
"Loan").

        WHEREAS, Assignor has executed a note in such principal amount (as the
same may be amended, modified, restated, severed, consolidated, renewed,
replaced, or supplemented from time to time, the "NOTE"), which is secured by,
INTER ALIA, that certain deed of trust, assignment of leases and rents and
security agreement (as amended from time to time, the "MORTGAGE") on the
Property.

        WHEREAS, it is a condition to the obligation of Assignee to make the
Loan to Assignor pursuant to the Loan Agreement that Assignor execute and
deliver this Assignment;

        WHEREAS, this Assignment is being given as additional security for the
Loan; and

        WHEREAS, capitalized terms used in this Assignment without definition
have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Agreement or the
Mortgage, as the case may be, the terms of each of which are specifically
incorporated by reference herein.

        NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which by
the parties hereto is hereby acknowledged, and additionally for the purpose of
additionally securing the Debt, Assignor hereby assigns, transfers, conveys and
sets over unto Assignee, all right, title and interest of Assignor in and to all
Leases and all Rents;

        TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the same unto Assignee, and its successors and
assigns forever, upon the terms and conditions and for the uses hereinafter set
forth.

        And Assignor hereby further agrees as follows:


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

        1.      CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS. Subject to
the terms of the Loan Agreement, Assignor represents, warrants and covenants to
Assignee that:

                (a)     The payment of the Rents to accrue under any Lease will
not be waived, released, reduced, discounted or otherwise discharged or
compromised by Assignor;

                (b)     Assignor has not performed, and will not perform, any
acts, and has not executed, and will not execute, any instrument that would
prevent Assignee from exercising its rights under this Assignment; and

                (c)     Assignor hereby authorizes and directs any tenant under
any of the Leases and any successor to all or any part of the interests of any
such tenant to pay directly to the Clearing Account, in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Agreement, the Rents due and to become due under such tenant's
Lease, and such authorization and direction shall be sufficient warrant to the
tenant to make future payments of Rents directly to the Clearing Account in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement without the necessity for
further consent by Assignor.

        2.      ASSIGNMENT; DEFERRED EXERCISE OF RIGHTS.

                (a)     As part of the consideration for the Debt, Assignor does
hereby absolutely and unconditionally assign to Assignee all right, title and
interest of Assignor in and to all present and future Leases and Rents, and this
Assignment constitutes a present and absolute assignment and is intended to be
unconditional and not as an assignment for additional security only. It is
further intended that it not be necessary for Assignee to institute legal
proceedings, absent any requirements of law or regulation to the contrary, to
enforce the provisions hereof. Assignor hereby authorizes Assignee or its agents
to collect the Rents; provided, however, that prior to an Event of Default, and
subject at all times to the requirement that payments and deposits of Rents be
made directly to the Clearing Account, Assignor shall have a revocable license,
but limited as provided in this Assignment and in any of the other Loan
Documents, to otherwise deal with, and enjoy the rights of the lessor under, the
Leases.

                (b)     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, and without the necessity of Assignee entering upon and taking
and maintaining full control of the Property in person, by agent or by
court-appointed receiver, the license referred to in paragraph (a) above shall
immediately be revoked and Assignee shall have the right at its option, to
exercise all rights and remedies contained in the Loan Documents, or otherwise
available at law or in equity.

        3.      RENTS HELD IN TRUST BY ASSIGNOR. Rents held or received by
Assignor shall be held or received by Assignor as trustee for the benefit of
Assignee only and shall immediately be deposited directly to the Clearing
Account in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.

        4.      EFFECT ON RIGHTS UNDER OTHER DOCUMENTS. Nothing contained in
this Assignment and no act done or omitted by Assignee pursuant to the powers
and rights granted it hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver by Assignee of
its rights and remedies under any of the other Loan Documents, and this
Assignment is made and accepted without prejudice to any of

                                       2
<PAGE>

the rights and remedies possessed by Assignee under the terms of the other Loan
Documents. The rights of Assignee under the other Loan Documents may be
exercised by Assignee either prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to any
action taken by it hereunder. This Assignment is intended to be supplementary to
and not in substitution for or in derogation of any assignment of rents or grant
of a security interest contained in any of the other Loan Documents.

        5.      EVENT OF DEFAULT. Upon or at any time after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, then in addition to and without
limiting any of Assignee's rights and remedies hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents and as otherwise available at law or in equity:

                (a)     Assignee may, at its option, without waiving such Event
of Default and without regard to the adequacy of the security for the Debt,
either in person or by agent, without bringing any action or proceeding, or by a
receiver appointed by a court, without taking possession of the Property in its
own name, demand, sue for or otherwise collect and receive all Rents, including
those past-due and unpaid, for application to the payment of the Debt in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, and Assignee may enter into,
and to the extent that Assignor would have the right to do so, cancel, enforce
or modify any Lease. The exercise by Assignee of the option granted it in this
Section and the collection of the Rents and the application thereof as herein
provided shall not be considered a waiver of any Event of Default.

                (b)     Assignor hereby acknowledges and agrees that payment of
any item of Rent by a Person to Assignee as hereinabove provided shall
constitute payment in full of such item of Rent by such Person, as fully and
with the same effect as if it had been paid to Assignor.

                (c)     Assignee in respect of the Leases and Rents shall have
all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial
Code as in effect in the State in which such rights and remedies are asserted as
described in Section 12(b) to the extent of such rights thereunder and
additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the
laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may
be asserted.

        6.      APPLICATION OF RENTS AND PROCEEDS. After the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Rents received or held by
Assignor or Assignee shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents.

        7.      ATTORNEY-IN-FACT. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default, Assignor hereby appoints Assignee the attorney-in-fact
of Assignor to take any action and execute any instruments that Assignor is
obligated, or has covenanted and agreed under the Loan Agreement or the other
Loan Documents to take or execute, which appointment as attorney-in-fact is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Assignor does hereby irrevocably appoint
Assignee as its attorney-in-fact with full power, in the name and stead of
Assignor to demand, collect, receive and give complete acquittance for any and
all of the Rents now due or that may hereafter become due, and at

                                       3
<PAGE>

Assignee's discretion, to file any claim, to take any other action, to institute
any proceeding or to make any settlement of any claim, either in its own name or
in the name of Assignor or otherwise, which Assignee may deem necessary or
desirable in order to collect and enforce the payment of Rents.

        8.      TERMINATION. Assignee, by the acceptance of this Assignment,
agrees that when all of the Debt shall have been paid in full, this Assignment
shall terminate, and Assignee shall execute and deliver to Assignor, upon such
termination such instruments of termination or re-assignment and Uniform
Commercial Code termination statements, all without recourse and without any
representation or warranty whatsoever, as shall be reasonably requested by
Assignor.

        9.      EXPENSES. Assignor agrees to pay to Assignee all out-of-pocket
expenses (including expenses for attorneys' fees and costs of every kind) of, or
incident to, the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Assignment or
performance by Assignee of any obligation of Assignor hereunder which Assignor
has failed or refused to perform.

        10.     FURTHER ASSURANCES. Assignor agrees that, from time to time upon
the written request of Assignee, it will give, execute, deliver, file and/or
record any financing statements, notice, instrument, document, agreement or
other papers and do such other acts and things that may be necessary and
desirable to create, preserve, perfect or validate this Assignment, to enable
Assignee to exercise and enforce its rights hereunder with respect to this
Assignment or to otherwise carry out the purposes and intent of this Assignment.

        11.     NO OBLIGATION BY ASSIGNEE. By virtue of this Assignment,
Assignee shall not be obligated to perform or discharge, nor does it hereby
undertake to perform or discharge, any obligation, duty or liability under any
of the Leases. This Assignment shall not operate to constitute Assignee as a
lender in possession of the Property or to place responsibility for the control,
care, management or repair of the Property upon Assignee, nor shall it operate
to make Assignee responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property
by any tenant or other party in possession or for any dangerous or defective
condition of the Property or for any negligence in the management, upkeep,
repair or control thereof.

        12.     MISCELLANEOUS.

                (a)     No failure on the part of Assignee or any of its agents
to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by Assignee or any of its
agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. Subject to
Section 16 hereof, the remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any remedies provided by law.

                (b)     WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO THE CREATION,
PERFECTION AND PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ASSIGNMENT, THIS
ASSIGNMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS
OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE

                                       4
<PAGE>

PROPERTY IS LOCATED, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
ABOVE IN THIS PARAGRAPH AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH
STATE, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN ALL MATTERS RELATING TO
THIS ASSIGNMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ALL OF THE INDEBTEDNESS OR
OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER. ALL PROVISIONS OF THE LOAN
AGREEMENT INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS SET FORTH IN THE
GOVERNING LAW PROVISION OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

                (c)     Subject to Section 16 hereof, all rights and remedies
set forth in this Assignment are cumulative, and Assignee may recover judgment
thereon, issue execution therefor, and resort to every other right or remedy
available at law or in equity, without first exhausting and without affecting or
impairing the security of any right or remedy afforded hereby; and no such right
or remedy set forth in this Assignment shall be deemed exclusive of any of the
remedies or rights granted to Assignee in any of the Loan Documents. Nothing
contained in this Assignment shall be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and
remedies of Assignee under the Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.

                (d)     Until the indebtedness and all other obligations secured
by the Loan Documents is paid in full, Assignor will, upon request, deliver from
time to time to Assignee executed originals to the extent available, otherwise
photocopies certified by Assignor as true, correct and complete, of executed
originals, of any and all existing Leases to which Assignor is a party, and
executed originals, or photocopies of executed originals, so certified by
Assignor, if an executed original is not available, of all other and future
Leases to which Assignor is a party, and upon request of Assignee, will
specifically transfer and assign to Assignee such other and future Leases upon
the same terms and conditions as herein contained.

                (e)     Assignor represents that it: (i) has been advised that
Assignee engages in the business of real estate financings and other real estate
transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive
with the business of Assignor or its affiliates; (ii) is represented by
competent counsel and has consulted counsel before executing this Assignment;
and (iii) has relied solely on its own judgment and on its counsel and advisors
in entering into the transaction(s) contemplated hereby without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Assignee or any
parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Assignee.

        13.     NO ORAL CHANGE. This Assignment may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Assignor and Assignee.

        14.     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Assignor may not assign its rights under
this Assignment except as permitted under the Loan Agreement. Subject to the
foregoing, this Assignment shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit
of, Assignor and Assignee and their respective successors and assigns.

        15.     NOTICES. All notices, requests and other communications provided
for herein shall be given or made in writing in the manner specified in the Loan
Agreement.

except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents.

        18.     COUNTERPARTS. This Assignment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Guarantor hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and save harmless Lender from and
against any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims, causes of action,
expenses and damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,
which Lender may suffer or which otherwise may arise by reason of Borrower's
failure to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when due, irrespective of

damages are incurred by Lender prior or subsequent to (i) Lender's declaring the
Principal, interest and other sums evidenced or secured by the Loan Documents to
be due and payable, (ii) the commencement or completion of a judicial or
non-judicial foreclosure of the Mortgage or (iii) the conveyance of all or any
portion of the Property by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.

                (d)     Each Guarantor agrees that no portion of any sums
applied (other than sums received from Guarantor in full or partial satisfaction
of its obligations hereunder), from time to time, in reduction of the Debt shall
be deemed to have been applied in reduction of the Guaranteed Obligations until
such time as the Debt has been paid in full, or Guarantors shall have made the
full payment required hereunder, it being the intention hereof that the
Guaranteed Obligations shall be the last portion of the Debt to be deemed
satisfied.

        3.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Guarantor hereby represents
and warrants (as to itself) to Lender as follows (which representations and
warranties shall be given as of the date hereof and shall survive the execution

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all necessary power

                                       2
<PAGE>

                (b)     ENFORCEABILITY. This Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

                (c)     NO VIOLATION. The execution, delivery and performance by
Guarantors of their obligations under this Guaranty has been duly authorized by
all necessary action, and do not and will not violate any law, regulation,
order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental body, agency or
other instrumentality applicable to a Guarantor, or result in a breach of any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result
in the creation or imposition of any mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance of
any nature whatsoever upon any of the assets of a Guarantor pursuant to the
terms of a Guarantor's articles of organization, or any mortgage, indenture,
agreement or instrument to which a Guarantor is a party or by which it or any of
its properties is bound. No Guarantor is in default under any other guaranty
which it has provided to Lender.

                (d)     NO LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or
proceedings at law or at equity, pending or, to each Guarantor's best knowledge,
threatened against or affecting a Guarantor or which involve or might involve
the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or which might materially
adversely affect the financial condition of a Guarantor or the ability of a
Guarantor to perform any of its obligations under this Guaranty. No Guarantor is
in default beyond any applicable grace or cure period with respect to any order,
writ, injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental Authority which might
materially adversely affect the financial condition of such Guarantor or the
ability of such Guarantor to perform any of its obligations under this Guaranty.

                (e)     CONSENTS. All consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, all
Governmental Authorities (collectively, the "CONSENTS") that are required in
connection with the valid execution, delivery and performance by Guarantors of
this Guaranty have been obtained and each Guarantor agrees that all Consents
required in connection with the carrying out or performance of any of such
Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty will be obtained when required.

                (f)     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION. All
financial statements of Guarantors heretofore delivered to Lender are true and
correct in all material respects and fairly present the financial condition of
Guarantors as of the respective dates thereof, and no materially adverse change
has occurred in the financial conditions reflected therein since the respective
dates thereof. None of the aforesaid financial statements or any certificate or
statement furnished to Lender by or on behalf of a Guarantor in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the representations and
warranties in this Guaranty contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein or herein not misleading. No Guarantor is insolvent within the
meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law, code
or regulation and the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty will
not render any Guarantor insolvent.

                                       3
<PAGE>

                (g)     CONSIDERATION. Each Guarantor is the owner, directly or

(a) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of BEHRINGER FUNDS, a
complete copy of BEHRINGER FUNDS' annual financial statements, (b) if requested

certified by BEHRINGER FUNDS and in form, content, level of detail and scope
reasonably satisfactory to Lender, and (c) 20 days after request by Lender, such

reasonably request.

        5.      UNCONDITIONAL CHARACTER OF OBLIGATIONS OF GUARANTORS.

                (a)     The obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall be
irrevocable, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the validity,
regularity or enforceability, in whole or in part, of the other Loan Documents
or any provision thereof, or the absence of any action to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any
judgment against Borrower, a Guarantor or any other Person or any action to
enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of the obligations of
Borrower under the other Loan Documents or Guarantors under this Guaranty, or
any setoff, counterclaim, and irrespective of any other circumstances which
might otherwise limit recourse against a Guarantor by Lender or constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety. Lender may
enforce the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty by a proceeding at
law, in equity or otherwise, independent of any loan foreclosure or similar
proceeding or any deficiency action against Borrower or any other Person at any
time, either before or after an action against the Property or any part thereof,
Borrower or any other Person. THIS GUARANTY IS A GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND
PERFORMANCE AND NOT MERELY A GUARANTY OF COLLECTION. Each Guarantor waives
diligence, notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, filing of claims with any
court, any proceeding to enforce any provision of any other Loan Document,
against such Guarantor, Borrower or any other Person, any right to require a
proceeding first against Borrower or any other Person, or to exhaust any
security (including, without limitation, the Property) for the performance of

        document or instrument relating thereto;

                        (iii)   the sale, transfer or conveyance of the Property
        or any interest therein to any Person, whether now or hereafter having

        portion thereof; or

                        (vii)   the transfer to and assumption by any Person of
        any tenancy in common interest in the Property pursuant to Section
        5.26.2 of the Loan Agreement (whether prior to, contemporaneous herewith
        or subsequent hereto), and the execution and delivery of any other
        guaranty of recourse obligations by any other guarantor in accordance
        with the terms thereof.

                (c)     Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Guaranty, each Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably waives all defenses in
an action brought by Lender to enforce this Guaranty based on claims of waiver,
release, surrender, alteration or compromise and all setoffs, reductions, or
impairments, whether arising hereunder or otherwise.

                (d)     Lender may deal with Borrower and Affiliates of Borrower
in the same manner and as freely as if this Guaranty did not exist and shall be
entitled, among other things, to grant Borrower or any other Person such
extension or extensions of time to perform any act or acts as may be deemed
advisable by Lender, at any time and from time to time,

                                       5
<PAGE>

without terminating, affecting or impairing the validity of this Guaranty or the
obligations of Guarantors hereunder.

                (e)     No compromise, alteration, amendment, modification,
extension, renewal, release or other change of, or waiver, consent, delay,
omission, failure to act or other action with respect to, any liability or
obligation under or with respect to, or of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of, the Loan Documents shall in any way alter, impair or affect any
of the obligations of Guarantors hereunder, and Guarantors agree that if any
Loan Document are modified with Lender's consent, the Guaranteed Obligations
shall automatically be deemed modified to include such modifications.

                (f)     Lender may proceed to protect and enforce any or all of
its rights under this Guaranty by suit in equity or action at law, whether for
the specific performance of any covenants or agreements contained in this
Guaranty or otherwise, or to take any action authorized or permitted under
applicable law, and shall be entitled to require and enforce the performance of
all acts and things required to be performed hereunder by Guarantors. Each and
every remedy of Lender shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and
shall be in addition to any other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity.

                (g)     No waiver shall be deemed to have been made by Lender of
any rights hereunder unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Lender,
and any such waiver shall be a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
involved and shall in no way impair the rights of Lender or the obligations of
Guarantors to Lender in any other respect or at any other time.

                (h)     At the option of Lender, any Guarantor may be joined in
any action or proceeding commenced by Lender against Borrower in connection with
or based upon any other Loan Documents and recovery may be had against any
Guarantor in such action or proceeding or in any independent action or
proceeding against such Guarantor to the extent of such Guarantor's liability
hereunder, without any requirement that Lender first assert, prosecute or
exhaust any remedy or claim against Borrower or any other Person, or any
security for the obligations of Borrower or any other Person.

                (i)     Guarantors agree that this Guaranty shall continue to be
effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment
is made by Borrower or a Guarantor to Lender and such payment is rescinded or
must otherwise be returned by Lender (as determined by Lender in its sole and
absolute discretion) upon insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization,
readjustment, composition, dissolution, receivership, conservatorship, winding
up or other similar proceeding involving or affecting Borrower or a Guarantor,
all as though such payment had not been made.

                (j)     In the event that any Guarantor shall advance or become
obligated to pay any sums under this Guaranty or in connection with the
Guaranteed Obligations or in the event that for any reason whatsoever Borrower
or any subsequent owner of the Property or any part thereof is now, or shall
hereafter become, indebted to a Guarantor, such Guarantor agrees that (i) the
amount of such sums and of such indebtedness and all interest thereon shall at
all times be subordinate as to lien, the time of payment and in all other
respects to all sums,

                                       6
<PAGE>

including principal and interest and other amounts, at any time owed to Lender
under the Loan Documents, and (ii) such Guarantor shall not be entitled to
enforce or receive payment thereof until all principal, Interest and other sums
due pursuant to the Loan Documents have been paid in full. Nothing herein
contained is intended or shall be construed to give any Guarantor any right of
subrogation in or under the Loan Documents or any right to participate in any
way therein, or in the right, title or interest of Lender in or to any
collateral for the Loan, notwithstanding any payments made by a Guarantor under
this Guaranty, until the actual and irrevocable receipt by Lender of payment in
full of all principal, Interest and other sums due with respect to the Loan or
otherwise payable under the Loan Documents. If any amount shall be paid to a
Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when any such sums
due and owing to Lender shall not have been fully paid, such amount shall be
paid by such Guarantor to Lender for credit and application against such sums
due and owing to Lender.

                (k)     Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall survive a
foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or similar proceeding involving the
Property and the exercise by Lender of any of all of its remedies pursuant to
the Loan Documents.

                           TENANTS IN COMMON AGREEMENT

        This TENANTS IN COMMON AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and effective as
of the date of recordation hereof (the "Effective Date"), by and among Behringer
Harvard Pratt H, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), and
the other Tenants in Common set forth on Schedule A attached hereto (each of the
Company and the other Tenants in Common shall sometimes individually be referred
to as "Tenant in Common" and collectively, as "Tenants in Common"), with
reference to the facts set forth below.

                                    RECITALS

        A.      The Tenants in Common will acquire the percentage undivided
interests set forth on Exhibit "A" in certain real property and improvements, as
more particularly described in Exhibit "B" attached hereto and incorporated
herein (the "Project", tenant in common interests in the Project shall be
referred to herein as "Interests").

        B.      The Tenants in Common desire to enter into this Agreement to
provide for the orderly administration of their rights and responsibilities as
to each other and as to others and to delegate authority and responsibility for
the intended further operation and management of the Project.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
set forth below.

        1.      NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CO-TENANTS. The Tenants in Common
shall each hold their respective Interests as tenants-in-common. The Tenants in
Common do not intend by this Agreement to create a partnership or a joint
venture, but merely to set forth the terms and conditions upon which each of
them shall hold their respective Interests. Neither do the Tenants in Common
wish to create a partnership or joint venture with the Property Manager (as
defined below). Each Tenant in Common hereby elects to be excluded from the
provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), with respect to the joint ownership of the Project. The
exclusion elected by the Tenants in Common hereunder shall commence with the
execution of this Agreement and shall be equally applicable to all assignees of
a Tenant in Common upon such assignment. Each Tenant in Common hereby covenants
and agrees that each Tenant in Common shall report on such Tenant in Common's
respective federal and state income tax returns such Tenant in Common's
respective share of items of income, gain/loss, deduction and credits that
result from holding the Project in a manner consistent with (i) the treatment of
the co-tenancy as a co-ownership of real property (and not a partnership) for
Federal and state income tax purposes and (ii) the exclusion of the Tenants in
Common from Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Code, commencing with the first
taxable year of such Tenant in Common that includes the Effective Date or, for
assignees of a Tenant in Common, the date of such assignment. No Tenant in
Common shall notify the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that such Tenant

                                       1
<PAGE>

in Common desires that Subchapter K of the Code apply to the Tenants in Common
and each Tenant in Common hereby agrees to indemnify, protect, defend and hold
the other Tenants in Common free and harmless from all costs, liabilities, tax
consequences and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, which
may result from any Tenant in Common so notifying the Commissioner in violation
of this Agreement or otherwise taking a contrary position on any tax return. The
Tenants in Common shall not file a partnership or corporate tax return, conduct
business under a common name, execute an agreement identifying any or all of the
Tenants in Common as partners, shareholders, or members of a business entity, or
otherwise hold themselves out as a partnership or other form of business entity.
Except as expressly provided herein, no Tenant in Common is authorized to act as
agent for, to act on behalf of, or to do any act that will bind any other Tenant
in Common or to incur any obligations with respect to the Project.

        2.      MANAGEMENT.

                2.1     MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. Concurrently with the acquisition
of the Project, the Tenants in Common will enter into a Property and Asset
Management Agreement (the "Management Agreement") with Behringer Harvard TIC
Management Services LP, a Texas limited partnership ("Property Manager").
Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Property Manager shall be the sole and
exclusive manager of the Project, interface with the owner and holder of any
first lien deed of trust encumbering the Project during the term of the
Management Agreement and act as the agent of the Tenants in Common with respect
to the management, operation, maintenance and leasing of the Project during the
term of the Management Agreement. A copy of the Management Agreement is attached
hereto as Exhibit "C" and the terms, covenants and conditions of the Management
Agreement are incorporated herein as if set forth in full. Neither (a) the
death, retirement, removal, withdrawal, termination or resignation of the
Property Manager, (b) any assignment for the benefit of creditors by or the
adjudication of bankruptcy or incompetency of the Property Manager nor (c) the
termination of the Management Agreement shall cause the termination of this
Agreement and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding any such events.

                2.2     UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE TENANTS IN COMMON.

                        2.2.1   The consent of all of the Tenants in Common
shall be required with respect to any sale, exchange, lease or release of all or
a portion of the Project, any loans secured by the Project ("Loan") or
modifications thereof, the approval of any property management agreement or any
extension, renewal or modification thereof. Whenever in this Agreement the
consent or approval of the Tenants in Common is required or otherwise requested,
with respect to any (i) sale or exchange of all or a portion of the Project or
(ii) Loan or modification of any Loan, the Tenants in Common shall have fifteen
(15) days after the date the request for such consent or approval is received
pursuant to Section 10.8 to approve or disapprove of the matter. Whenever in
this Agreement the consent or approval of the Tenants in Common is required or
otherwise requested, with respect to any modification or renewal of the any
property management agreement, the Tenants in Common shall have thirty (30) days
after the date the request for consent or approval is received pursuant to
Section 10.8 to approve or disapprove of the matter. Whenever in this Agreement
the consent or approval of the Tenants in Common is required or otherwise
requested, with respect to any lease or release of all or a portion of the
Project, the Tenants in Common shall have five (5) days after the date the
request for consent or approval is received pursuant to Section 10.8 to the
Tenants in Common for their approval or disapproval of the matter. The Tenants
in Common agree to use their best efforts to respond to any request for consent
or approval. If a Tenant in Common does not disapprove of such matter within the
specified response period described above, the Tenant in Common shall be deemed
to have approved the matter. By execution hereof, the Tenants in Common confirm
their approval of the Management Agreement and that certain Loan made (or to be
made immediately after the execution of this Agreement) by Citigroup Global
Markets Realty Corp.

                                       2

(together with its successors and/or assigns, "Citigroup") secured by, among
other things, a mortgage or deed of trust ("Deed of Trust") on the Project (the
"Citigroup Loan").

                        2.2.2   The consent of 50% of the Tenants in Common
shall be required for the approval of the annual capital and operating budget
("Budget") for the promotion, operation, leasing, repair, maintenance and
improvement of the Project for each calendar year. The Property Manager shall
prepare the Budget. The Budget for the initial calendar year is attached hereto
as Exhibit "C" to the Management Agreement and is hereby approved by each Tenant
in Common. The Property Manager shall deliver each subsequent Budget for each
subsequent calendar year by December 15th of the calendar year before the budget
year, or as soon as possible thereafter. The Tenants in Common shall have
fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Budget to the Tenants in Common to
approve or disapprove of the Budget. The Tenants in Common agree to use their
best efforts to approve the Budget. If a Tenant in Common does not disapprove
the Budget, or any item therein, within such fifteen (15) day specified response
period described above, the Tenant in Common shall have been deemed to have
approved the Budget. In the event the approval is not obtained, the
non-approving Tenant(s) in Common shall negotiate in good faith with the
Property Manager and the other Tenants in Common for fifteen (15) days to
resolve the issue. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the issue
shall be resolved by arbitration as set forth in Section 8.1 with the disputing
Tenants in Common and the other Tenants in Common each paying 50% of the costs
of the arbitration. The Property Manager may proceed under the terms of the
proposed Budget for items that are not objected to and may take any action with
respect to items not approved for Emergency Expenditures (as defined in Section
2.5.2 of the Management Agreement). In the event that the items that are
objected to are operational expenditures, as opposed to capital expenditures,
the Property Manager shall be entitled to operate the Project using the prior
year's budget until approval is obtained. The Property Manager may at any time
submit a revised Budget to the Tenants in Common for their approval which will
be governed by the terms of this Section 2.2.2.

                2.3     MAJORITY CONSENT OF THE TENANTS IN COMMON. Whenever the
approval or consent of the Tenants in Common is required with respect to any
items, other than those set forth in Section 2.2, the approval or consent of the
Tenants in Common holding more than 50% of the undivided Interests in the
Project shall be required to approve such action. The Tenants in Common shall
have fifteen (15) days after the date the request for such consent or approval
is received pursuant to Section 10.8 to approve or disapprove of the matter. The
Tenants in Common agree to use their best efforts to respond to any request for
consent or approval. If a Tenant in Common does not disapprove of any item
requiring the consent of the Tenants in Common pursuant to this Section 2.3
within the fifteen (15) day specified response period described above, the
Tenant in Common shall be deemed to have approved the matter.

        3.      INCOME AND LIABILITIES. Except as otherwise provided herein and
in the Management Agreement, all benefits and obligations of the ownership of
the Project, including, without limitation, income, revenue, operating expenses,
proceeds from sale or refinance or condemnation awards shall be shared by the
Tenants in Common in proportion to their respective undivided Interests in the
Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) each Tenant in Common shall be
responsible for all real estate and personal property taxes, general and special
real property assessments and other like charges (collectively "Taxes")
attributable to its undivided Interest in the Project, (b) fees under the
Management Agreement shall be paid by each of the Tenants in Common as provided
in the Management Agreement and (c) expenses or other costs that are not applied
to the Tenants in Common pro rata based on their Interests in the Project shall
be separately charged to each Tenant in Common. The Tenants in Common shall
receive, within 3 months of receipt by the Property Manager, all cash from
operations of the Project after payment of expenses and debt service and reserve
payments under any Loan, including the Citigroup Loan, in proportion to their
respective undivided Interests in the Project, except for such amounts as may be
determined by the Property Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement to be
retained for reserves or improvements.

        4.      CO-TENANT'S OBLIGATIONS. The Tenants in Common each agree to
perform such acts as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation:

                4.1     DOCUMENTS. The Tenants in Common shall execute any and
all documents required in connection with a sale or refinancing of the Project
in accordance with Section 5 and such additional documents as may be required
under this Agreement or may be reasonably required to effect the intent of the
Tenants in Common with respect to the Project or any Loans.

                4.2     ADDITIONAL FUNDS. Each Tenant in Common will be
responsible for a pro rata share (based on its undivided Interest in the Project
or as otherwise provided with respect to the fees under the Management Agreement
or other items specifically applicable to individual Tenants in Common) with
respect to operating expenses, Taxes (as defined in the Management Agreement),
debt service, the fees payable to the Property Manager pursuant to the
Management Agreement, or other items specifically applicable to individual
Tenants in Common or any future cash needed in connection with the ownership,
operation, management and maintenance of the Project as determined by the
Property Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Tenant in Common agrees that if any Loan for the Project
provides for recourse liability to Behringer or the Company or any affiliate and
non-recourse liability to one or more of the other Tenants in Common, and if
Behringer or the Company or any affiliate pays more than its pro rata share of
the liability related to the Loan (as compared to its ownership Interest) as a
result of such recourse liability ("Excess Payment"), the Tenants in Common
agree to reimburse Behringer or the Company or any affiliate for the Tenants in
Common's pro rata share of such Excess Payment; provided, however, that the
Property Manager has agreed to indemnify the Tenants in Common in Section 13.9.2
of the Management Agreement to the extent a Tenant in Common becomes liable to
any lender as a result of certain actions of the Property Manager. In addition,
each Tenant in Common shall be liable for, and indemnify and hold harmless, the
other Tenants in Common and their affiliates as a result of any action or
inaction by such Tenant in Common that causes any recourse liability or damages
to the Tenants in Common or their affiliates or the Project with respect to any
Loan. To the extent any Tenant in Common fails to advance any funds or fails to
pay its share of expenses pursuant to this Section within fifteen (15) days
after the Property Manager or the Company delivers notice that such additional
funds are required, such Tenant in Common shall be deemed to be a Defaulting
Tenant in Common as defined in Section 7.3 of this Agreement. In addition, the
Property Manager is hereby authorized to withhold from the Defaulting Tenant in
Common's share of proceeds and distributions any amounts due under this Section
4.2 and not paid by any such Defaulting Tenant in Common. In the event any
Tenant in Common becomes a Defaulting Tenant in Common, the ownership Interest
in the Project of the Defaulting Tenant in Common may be purchased in accordance
with Sections 7.3 and 8.3 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall any loans among any
Tenants in Common exist or be deemed to exist at any time that the Citigroup
Loan or any portion thereof is outstanding.

        5.      SALE OR ENCUMBRANCE OF PROJECT.

                5.1     SALE. In accordance with the Management Agreement, the
Property Manager shall be entitled to seek and negotiate the terms of (a)
permanent and other financing for the Project, including Loans, (b) the sale of
the Project (or portions thereof) to third-party purchasers (a "Sale"), and (c)
any lease of all or any portion of the Project. Any Loan and any sale, exchange,
transfer, lease or release of all or a portion of the Project shall be subject
to unanimous approval of the Tenants in Common, which approval shall be as set
forth in Section 2.2.1. Any such written request of the Property Manager shall
be accompanied by a copy of a bona fide offer to purchase, a loan commitment
letter setting forth all the material terms of the transaction or the principal
lease terms.

                                       4
<PAGE>

                5.2     SALE PROCEEDS. To the extent necessary, the proceeds of
a Sale shall (i) first, be, used to pay in full any Loans, (ii) second, be used
to pay all outstanding costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
holding, marketing and sale of the Project and (iii) third, any proceeds of a
Sale remaining after payment of the items set forth above shall be paid as
provided in Section 3.

        6.      POSSESSION. The Tenants in Common intend to lease the Project at
all times and no Tenant in Common shall have the right to occupy or use the
Project at any time during the term of this Agreement.

        7.      TRANSFER OR ENCUMBRANCE.

                7.1     TRANSFER. Each Tenant in Common may sell, transfer,
convey, pledge, encumber or hypothecate its Interest or any part thereof (each a
"Transfer"), provided that any transferee shall take such Interest subject to
this Agreement and the Management Agreement, to the extent the Management
Agreement is in effect at the time of the Transfer, and the transferor and
transferee shall execute and cause to be recorded an assignment and assumption
agreement ("Assumption Agreement") whereby (i) the transferor assigns to the
transferee all of its right, title and interest in and to this Agreement and the
Management Agreement; and (ii) the transferee assumes and agrees to perform
faithfully and to be bound by all of the terms, covenants, conditions,
provisions and agreements of this Agreement and the Management Agreement with
respect to the Interest to be transferred. Upon execution and recordation of
such Assumption Agreement the transferor shall be relieved of all liability
under this Agreement accruing after the date of recordation of the Assumption
Agreement and the transferee shall become a party to this Agreement without
further action by the other Tenants in Common. The Tenants in Common acknowledge
that Behringer Harvard Pratt S, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Behringer") is selling Interests pursuant to the Confidential Private
Placement Memorandum of Tenant in Common Interests in 250 West Pratt dated
November 11, 2004 ("Offering Memorandum"). Each Tenant in Common shall be
responsible for compliance with applicable securities laws with respect to any
sale of its Interest.

                7.2     RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. If a Tenant in Common (a "Selling
Tenant") desires to sell its Interest or any portion thereof, then such Selling
Tenant shall first allow the Company or its affiliates or assigns, and second
the Tenants in Common other than the Selling Tenant (each an "Offeror" and
collectively the "Offerors") to make an offer to purchase the Selling Tenant's
Interest pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section;
provided, however, no right of first offer will be required with respect to (i)
sales by Behringer of undivided Interests in the Project pursuant to the
Offering Memorandum, or (ii) transfers from Behringer or the Company to their
affiliates. If a Selling Tenant desires to sell its Interest, such Selling
Tenant shall provide written notice (the "First Refusal Notice") of its intent
to sell its Interest to each Offeror. The Company or its affiliates or its
assigns shall first have the right, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
the First Refusal Notice pursuant to Section 10.8, to deliver a written offer to
the Selling Tenant to purchase the Selling Tenant's entire Interest. If the
Selling Tenant does not accept an offer from the Company or its affiliates or
assigns within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the First Refusal Notice
pursuant to Section 10.8 then each Tenant in Common other than the Selling
Tenant shall have the right within the next fifteen (15) days after the end of
the first fifteen (15) day period, to deliver an offer to the Selling Tenant to
purchase the Selling Tenant's Interest for a price that is greater than the
price offered by the Company or its affiliates or assigns. Each Tenant in Common
shall be entitled to purchase a portion of the Selling Tenant's Interest in
proportion to their undivided Interest in the Project. If any Tenant in Common
elects not to purchase such Tenant in Common's share of the Selling Tenant's
Interest, then the other Tenants in Common shall be entitled to purchase
additional portions of the Selling Tenant's Interests based on their Interest in
the Project. If the Selling Tenant accepts any offer pursuant to the preceding
three sentences, it must also accept all other offers at a purchase price at or
above the offers it accepts. If the Selling Tenant does not accept the offers

                                       5
<PAGE>

for the sale of the Selling Tenant's entire Interest from either the Company or
its affiliates or assigns or the Tenants in Common other than the Selling Tenant
for any portion of the Selling Tenant's Interest, then the Selling Tenant shall
be free to sell its Interest (or remaining Interest) in the Project to a
purchaser other than an Offeror; provided that the sale of the Selling Tenant's
Interest to a purchaser (other than an Offeror) is (a) for a price greater than
any purchase price offered by an Offeror and not accepted by the Selling Tenant
pursuant to this Section 7.2, (b) in compliance with the terms of any Loan, and
(c) completed within 120 days of such Selling Tenant's refusal of the last offer
from either the Company or its affiliates or assigns or the Tenants in Common
other than the Selling Tenant. If such sale is not completed within such 120 day
period, the Selling Tenant must again provide each Offeror with its right of
first offer granted hereunder if it wishes to sell its Interest or any portion
thereof. Any offer provided hereunder by the Company or its affiliates or
assigns or a Tenant in Common and any acceptance of such an offer shall be
irrevocable and may be enforced through an action for specific performance
without the necessity of posting bond. The closing of any such offer shall occur
not later than ninety (90) days after the date of acceptance at the offices of
the Company. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to the sale of any
Tenant in Common's Interest if the process for purchase of such Interest has
begun under any other provision of this Agreement, including under Section 7.3,
7.4, 8.1 or 9, and this Section may not be invoked after any such process is
begun unless and until that process is abandoned.

                7.3     PURCHASE OPTION OF DISSENTING OR DEFAULTING TENANT IN
COMMON'S INTEREST. The Tenants in Common agree that the Company or any of its
affiliates or assigns shall have the right, while this Agreement remains in
effect, to purchase a Dissenting Tenant in Common's (as defined below) interest
or a Defaulting Tenant in Common's (as defined below) Interest in the Project as
set forth in this Section 7.3. A "Dissenting Tenant in Common" shall mean a
Tenant in Common who votes against or fails to consent to any item that requires
the unanimous approval or consent of the Tenants in Common pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement when Tenants in Common holding more than fifty percent (50%)
of the undivided Interests in the Project have voted or provided consent for
such action. A "Defaulting Tenant in Common" shall mean a Tenant in Common who
is in default under any Loan or any documents in respect of any such Loan ("Loan
Documents"), the Management Agreement or this Agreement. In order to exercise
this option, the Company or its affiliates or assigns shall provide written
notice of its election to exercise this option (i) if to a Dissenting Tenant in
Common at any time prior to forty-five (45) days after the approval period for
such vote or consent has terminated as provided in any request for such vote or
consent or (ii) if to a Defaulting Tenant in Common during the period such
Defaulting Tenant in Common is in default and for a period of forty-five (45)
days thereafter. The purchase price of the Dissenting Tenant in Common or the
Defaulting Tenant in Common's Interest shall be equal to the Fair Market Value
of its Interest (as determined pursuant to Section 8.3 of this Agreement). In
the event a Defaulting Tenant in Common's Interest is purchased pursuant to this
Section and the Defaulting Tenant in Common is liable to any party under the
Management Agreement, this Agreement or any Loan, including any Lender, for its
losses or for any principal or interest of a Loan as a result of any
non-recourse carve-out or springing recourse under the Loan Documents, the
Defaulting Tenant in Common hereby authorizes the Company (although the Company
will have no obligation hereunder) to withhold from the payment of the purchase
price an amount equal to such losses or principal or interest and to pay such
amounts directly to the Lender or other party claiming under the applicable Loan
on behalf of the Defaulting Tenant in Common.

                7.4     PURCHASE OPTION BY THE COMPANY. In the event Behringer
Harvard REIT I, Inc. or any other real estate fund affiliated with or directly
or indirectly sponsored by Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC (a "BH Fund") becomes
the direct or indirect owner of the Company, the Company or its affiliates or
assigns shall have the option, but not the obligation, to purchase all of the
Tenants in Common's Interests as set forth in this Section 7.4 beginning no
sooner than the earlier of (i) one year prior to the end of any Loan term, (ii)
the announcement by BH Fund of its intention to liquidate its assets, or (iii)
the announcement by the BH Fund of its intention to liquidate its investment
portfolio or

                                       6
<PAGE>

list its equity securities on any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ
stock market (collectively, an "Exchange"). In order to exercise this option,
the Company or its affiliates or assigns shall provide written notice of its
election to so exercise to the Tenants in Common. The purchase price of any
Interest purchased under this Section 7.4 shall be equal to the Fair Market
Value of such Interest (as determined pursuant to Section 8.3 of this
Agreement).

        8.      RIGHT OF PARTITION.

                8.1     Subject to Section 8.2, the Tenants in Common agree that
any Tenant in Common and any of its successors-in-interests shall have the
right, while this Agreement remains in effect, to have the Project partitioned,
and to file a complaint or institute any proceeding at law or in equity to have
the Project partitioned in accordance with and to the extent provided by
applicable law. The Tenants in Common acknowledge that partition of the Project
may result in a forced sale by all of the Tenants in Common. To avoid the
inequity of a forced sale and the potential adverse effect on the investment by
the Tenants in Common, the Tenants in Common agree that, as a condition
precedent to filing a partition action, the Tenant in Common filing such action
("Partition Seller") shall first make a written offer to sell its Interest first
to the Company or its affiliates or assigns and second to the other Tenants in
Common at a price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Interest (as determined
pursuant to Section 8.3 of this Agreement). If the Company or its affiliates or
assigns do not accept such offer within such twenty (20) day period, then the
other Tenants in Common shall be entitled to purchase a portion of the Partition
Seller's Interest in proportion to their undivided Interests in the Project at a
price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Interest (as determined in
accordance with Section 8.3 of this Agreement) within the next twenty (20) days.
If any Tenant in Common elects not to purchase its share of the Partition
Seller's Interest, the other Tenants in Common shall be entitled to purchase
additional Interests based on their percentage Interests in the Project.

                8.2     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.1,
so long as the Citigroup Loan or any portion thereof is outstanding, each Tenant
in Common agrees that it will not seek or be entitled to seek and obtain a
partition of all or any part of the Project without first obtaining the prior
written consent of Citigroup. Accordingly, each Tenant in Common expressly
waives any right it may have to partition the Project or any part thereof,
whether such rights arise under the law of the State of Maryland, or otherwise,
unless Citigroup has consented in writing to such party's exercise of such
rights.

                8.3     DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CLOSING
                        MECHANICS.

                        8.3.1   For purposes of this Agreement, the "Fair Market
Value" of a Tenant in Common seller's ("Seller") Interest in the Project in
connection with any sales made under Section 7.3, 7.4, 8.1 or 9 hereof shall
mean the fair market value of Seller's undivided Interest (determined by
multiplying the selling Tenant in Common's percentage Interest in the Project on
the date of an offer or exercise of an option, as applicable, by the fair market
value of the Project reduced by (i) liabilities secured by the Project or
liabilities taken subject to, (ii) Seller's proportionate share of any fee or
other amount that would be payable to the Property Manager or any affiliates
(including any real estate commission) under the Management Agreement upon the
sale of the Project and (iii) selling, closing, prepayment (to the extent
reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the other Tenants in Common) or other
costs that would apply in the event the Project was sold on the date of the
offer or exercise of the option, as applicable) as determined in accordance with
the procedures set forth below, including any unpaid advances made pursuant to
Section 4.2 on behalf of Seller. Closing costs and prorations shall be allocated
as is standard practice where the Project is located. Upon the exercise of an
option under Sections 7.3, 7.4 or 9 or acceptance of an offer under Section 8.1
by the Company or its affiliates or assigns or any or all of the other Tenants
in Common ("Purchaser"), as applicable, Purchaser shall submit to Seller its
estimate of the fair market value of the Project, along with all documentation
supporting such estimate

                                       7
<PAGE>

which Purchaser deems appropriate. If Seller does not accept such estimate
within fifteen (15) days, Purchaser may either (a) abandon and rescind its
option exercise or offer acceptance by written notice to Seller or (b) select an
independent certified MAI real estate appraiser to determine the fair market
value of the Project, which determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
of the appointment of such appraiser. Seller shall have fifteen (15) days after
receipt of the appraisal to accept or reject such appraisal. If the Seller does
not respond or any Seller rejects the appraisal, Purchaser may either (a)
abandon and rescind its option exercise or offer acceptance by written notice to
Seller or (b) select a second independent certified MAI real estate appraiser
within five (5) days of such rejection. The first appraiser and the second
appraiser shall then select a third certified MAI real estate appraiser within
fifteen (15) days of the selection of the second appraiser, and the third
appraiser shall make a determination of the fair market value of the Project
within 30 days of its appointment. The determination by the third appraiser
shall be binding on the parties. The cost of such appraisal shall be paid
equally by Seller (and all other Sellers acquiring in connection with the same
process) and Purchaser. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing shall prevent a
Seller from agreeing to the price to be paid for its Interest regardless of the
above procedure. The consummation of the purchase of Interests under any of
Sections 7.3, 7.4, 8.1 or 9 hereof may be made contingent upon the occurrence of
some other event (the "Contingent Event") if so provided in the notice of option
exercise or offer acceptance; provided that the notice shall be deemed rescinded
if the specified event fails to occur within one hundred eighty (180) days after
the date of receipt of such notice as determined under Section 10.8. Any such
rescission shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of the options under Sections
7.3, 7.4 or 9, all of which remain open to exercise after the event giving rise
to the option. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, offer
Seller the option to exchange its Interest for equity securities of the BH Fund
or, if applicable, its umbrella partnership (the "Exchange Securities") at an
amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Interest (as determined above) and
at then current fair market value of the BH Fund shares or units. The fair
market value of such Exchange Securities shall be the average daily closing
price of such securities on the main Exchange on which they are listed for the
five trading days after the date of the Company's notice of exercise of the
option or acceptance of the offer, as applicable, or if not so listed and the BH
Fund is offering the Exchange Security to the public in connection with its
listing on an Exchange, the offering price for the Exchange Securities in such
offering, or if not so listed, as last established by an independent process in
the ordinary course by the BH Fund or, in the BH Fund's sole discretion, an
appraisal by an independent appraiser for the purpose of establishing such fair
market value in connection therewith. For valuation purposes, the value of any
umbrella partnership units of a BH Fund shall be the value established for the
common stock of such BH Fund as adjusted for the ratio of conversion of such
units into such common stock if not one for one. In the event that the Company
exercises the option and does not offer the Tenants in Common the option to
exchange their Interest for Exchange Securities or a Tenant in Common elects not
to exchange its Interest for Exchange Securities, the purchase price for the
Seller's Interest shall be paid in cash.

                        8.3.2   Any Interest to be purchased under this Section
8.3 or any of Sections 7.3, 7.4, 8.1 or 9 hereof shall be transferred to the
Purchaser as of the date of notice of exercise of option or acceptance of offer
pursuant to Section 10.8 or, if applicable, the date of the occurrence of the
Contingent Event; provided, however, the Company or its affiliates or assigns
may delay the transfer of the Interest for any length of time as specified in
such notice up and through the date of the payment date and provided, further,
that, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.3, 7.4, 8.1 or 9 hereof, the
transfer, and effective date of such transfer, shall be subject to any consent
of any Lender, if required. The closing of the purchase of Seller's Interest
shall occur at the offices of the Company within thirty (30) days from the date
a fair market value of the Project is determined or Seller otherwise agrees to
the price to be paid. The obligation to pay the purchase price shall bear
interest at the short-term Applicable Federal Rate from the date of exercise of
the option or acceptance of the offer through the payment date. The Purchaser
shall take Seller's Interest subject to the liabilities included in the
determination of fair market value of the Project secured by the Project and the
Management Agreement which may include

                                       8
<PAGE>

unpaid fees due to the Property Manager. For purposes of this Section 8.3, there
will be multiple Sellers in the event that (i) multiple Tenants in Common
simultaneously have on file a partition action, (ii) a simultaneous transaction
results in multiple Dissenting Tenants in Common or Defaulting Tenants in
Common, (iii) multiple Tenant in Common Interests are purchased pursuant to
Section 7.4 or (iv) a simultaneous transaction results in multiple Bankrupt
Tenants in Common.

        9.      BANKRUPTCY OPTION.

                9.1     OPTION. If, during the term of this Agreement, a Tenant
in Common becomes Bankrupt, it shall so notify the Company in writing (the
"Bankrupt Tenant's Notice"). After such notification or after the Company
independently becomes aware that the Tenant in Common has become Bankrupt and
the Company provides written notice of such fact to the Tenant in Common (the
"Notice of Bankruptcy"), the Company or its affiliates or assigns shall have the
right, to be exercised by written notice ("Bankruptcy Call Notice") to the
Bankrupt Tenant in Common, to purchase all of the Bankrupt Tenant in Common's
Interest in the Project. Upon receipt of the Bankruptcy Call Notice, the
Bankrupt Tenant in Common shall be obligated to sell to the Company or its
affiliates or assigns or in the event that the Company or its affiliates or
assigns do not elect to exercise the option within twenty (20) days of the first
to occur of Bankrupt Tenant's Notice or the Notice of Bankruptcy without receipt
of the Bankruptcy Call Notice, sell to the other Tenants in Common who by
written notice within twenty (20) days thereafter exercise an option to purchase
the Bankrupt Tenant in Common's entire Interest for the Fair Market Value of the
Bankrupt Tenant in Common's Interest (as determined pursuant to Section 8.3). If
any Tenant in Common elects not to purchase its share of the Bankrupt Tenant in
Common's Interest, the other Tenants in Common shall be entitled to purchase
additional Interests based on their percentage Interests in the Project.

                9.2     BANKRUPT. For purposes of this Agreement, a Tenant in
Common shall be considered Bankrupt if such Tenant in Common: (1) is unable to
pay debts as they come due, including any debt associated with the Project; (2)
admits in writing to his or her inability to pay debts as they due, including
any debt associated with the Project; (3) makes a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors; (4) files any petition or answer seeking to adjudicate it
bankrupt or insolvent; (5) seeks liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of its debts; (6)
seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the entry of an order for relief or the
appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or other similar official or for
any substantial part of its property; (7) the entry of an order for relief or
approving a petition for relief or reorganization, arrangement, composition,
readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any present or
future bankruptcy, insolvency or similar statute, law or regulation or the
filing of any such petition that is not dismissed in 90 days; (8) entry of an
order appointing a trustee, custodian, receiver or liquidator of all or any
substantial portion of its property, which order is not dismissed within sixty
(60) days or (9) is considered bankrupt under the Loan Documents.

                9.3     RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. If, under federal bankruptcy
law, similar debtor relief laws, or other laws affecting the Project, the option
to purchase granted under this Section 9 is voided or declared unenforceable,
the Company or its affiliates or assigns shall have a right of first refusal to
buy any Interest in the Project of a Bankrupt Tenant in Common in the event of
any proposed transfer by a trustee, receiver, conservator, liquidator, guardian,
or other transferee. Such right of first refusal shall provide that the Company
or its affiliates or assigns may purchase the Bankrupt Tenant in Common's
interest in the Project at the same price and on the same terms as the Project
is proposed to be sold by such trustee, receiver, conservator, liquidator,
guardian or other transferee.

        10.     GENERAL PROVISIONS.

                10.1    MUTUALITY, RECIPROCITY, RUNS WITH THE LAND. All
provisions, conditions, covenants, restrictions, obligations and agreements
contained herein or in the Management Agreement are made for the direct, mutual
and reciprocal benefit of each and every part of the Project; shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the Tenants in Common and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, devisees,
representatives, lessees and all other persons acquiring any undivided Interest
or any portion thereof whether by operation of law or any manner whatsoever
(collectively, "Successors"); shall create mutual, equitable servitudes and
burdens upon the Interest of each Tenant in Common in favor of the Interest of
every other Tenant in Common; shall create reciprocal rights and obligations
between the respective Tenants in Common, their Interests, and their Successors;
and shall, as to each of the Tenants in Common and their Successors operate as
covenants running with the land, for the benefit of the other Tenants in Common
pursuant to applicable law. It is expressly agreed that each covenant contained
herein or in the Management Agreement (i) is for the benefit of and is a burden
upon the undivided Interests of each of the Tenants in Common, (ii) runs with
the undivided Interest of each Tenant in Common and (iii) benefits and is
binding upon each Successor owner during its ownership of any Interest, and each
owner having any interest therein derived in any manner through any Tenant in
Common or Successor. Every person or entity who now or hereafter owns or
acquires any right, title or interest in or to any portion of the Project is and
shall be conclusively deemed to have consented and agreed to every restriction,
provision, covenant, right and limitation contained herein or in the Management
Agreement, whether or not such person or entity expressly assumes such
obligations or whether or not any reference to this Agreement or the Management
Agreement is contained in the instrument conveying such interest in the Project
to such person or entity. The Tenants in Common agree that any Successor shall
become a party to this Agreement and the Management Agreement upon acquisition
of an Interest as if such person was a Tenant in Common initially executing this
Agreement.

                10.2    BINDING ARBITRATION. Any controversy between the parties
hereto arising out of or related to this Agreement or the breach thereof or an
investment in the Interests shall be settled by arbitration in Dallas County,
Texas, in accordance with the rules of The American Arbitration Association, and
judgment entered upon the award rendered may be enforced by appropriate judicial
action. The arbitration panel shall consist of one member, which shall be the
mediator if mediation has occurred or shall be a person agreed to by each party
to the dispute within 30 days following notice by one party that he or she
desires that a matter be arbitrated. If there was no mediation and the parties
are unable within such 30 day period to agree upon an arbitrator, then the panel
shall be one arbitrator selected by the Dallas office of The American
Arbitration Association, which arbitrator shall be experienced in the area of
real estate and limited liability companies and who shall be knowledgeable with
respect to the subject matter area of the dispute. The losing party shall bear
any fees and expenses of the arbitrator, other tribunal fees and expenses,
reasonable attorneys' fees of both parties, any costs of producing witnesses and
any other reasonable costs or expenses incurred by the losing party or the
prevailing party or such costs shall be allocated by the arbitrator. The
arbitration panel shall render a decision within 30 days following the close of
presentation by the parties of their cases and any rebuttal. The parties shall
agree within 30 days following selection of the arbitrator to any prehearing
procedures or further procedures necessary for the arbitration to proceed,
including interrogatories or other discovery; provided, in any event each Tenant
in Common shall be entitled to discovery in accordance with the Texas
Arbitration Act, ss. 171.001 et. seq. of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code.

                10.3    ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any action or proceeding is
instituted between all or any of the Tenants in Common arising from or related
to or with this Agreement, the Tenant in Common or Tenants in Common prevailing

Tenant in Common or Tenants in Common all of its or their costs of action or
proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs as fixed by
the court or arbitrator therein.

                10.4    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the
Management Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and all prior and contemporaneous
agreements, representations, negotiations and understandings of the parties
hereto, oral or written, are hereby superseded and merged herein.

Dallas, Texas.

                10.7    MODIFICATION. No modification, waiver, amendment,
discharge or change of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same is in
writing and signed by the party against which the enforcement of such
modification, waiver, amendment, discharge or change is or may be sought and,
except for amendments occurring as a result of a transfer of any Interest that
is made pursuant to the loan documents in respect of the Citigroup Loan (the
"Citigroup Loan Documents") is consented to in writing by Citigroup and, after
securitization of the Citigroup Loan, unless the Property Manager shall have
provided written confirmation from each rating agency that provides a rating in

withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of such rating. Citigroup is expressly
intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section and shall have the

become illegal, null or void or against public policy, for any reason, or shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, null or void or
against public policy, the remaining portions of this Agreement shall not be
affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent
permissible by law.

        11.     ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS REGARDING THE "CITIGROUP
                LOAN.

                11.1    Each Tenant in Common agrees that this Agreement, and
all rights and privileges and remedies of each Tenant in Common hereunder,
including without limitation, (i) any rights of first refusal (including any
such rights arising under Section 363(i) of Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code), purchase options or other similar rights under this Agreement,
are subject and subordinate to the deed of trust and the other loan documents
with respect to the Citigroup Loan ("Loan Documents") and the liens created
thereby, and to all rights of the Lender thereunder. No party may exercise any
remedy provided for herein (including any rights of indemnification) against any
other party for as long as the Citigroup Loan (or any portion thereof) is
outstanding; provided, however, that as long as no Event of Default (as defined
in the Loan Documents) currently exists, the parties subject to the rights
described above and in Sections 7.3, 7.4, 8 and 9 shall be entitled to exercise
such options.

                11.2    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, each Tenant in Common hereby waives, for so long as the Citigroup Loan
(or any portion thereof) is outstanding, any lien rights, whether statutory or
otherwise, that it may have against the co-tenancy interest of any other Tenant
in Common.

                                       12
<PAGE>

                11.3    For so long as the Citigroup Loan (or any portion
thereof) is outstanding, the Lender shall be a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

                11.4    For so long as the Citigroup Loan (or any portion
thereof) is outstanding, this Agreement may not be terminated or cancelled,
modified, changed, supplemented, altered or amended in any manner whatsoever,
without the prior written consent of the Lender except pursuant to any Permitted
Transfers allowed under the Loan Documents.

                11.5    Each Tenant in Common covenants and agrees not to take
any action with respect to the Project or its respective co-tenancy interest in
the Project that would constitute a default under the Citigroup Loan, or create
personal liability for any Tenant in Common under the provisions of the Loan
Documents.

                11.6    This Agreement as it may be amended from time to time in
accordance with the provisions hereof, and all of the terms and conditions
hereof, are hereby made and shall continue to be fully subject and subordinate
in all respects to all of the liens, terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.
Such subordination shall be automatic and no further agreement or document shall
be necessary to effect such subordination but, without detracting from the
automatic nature of such subordination, upon Citigroup's request, each Tenant in
Common shall execute and deliver to Citigroup an instrument of subordination
satisfactory to Citigroup in form and substance.

                11.7    Each Tenant in Common hereby irrevocably assigns to
Citigroup its claim and rights to vote in any bankruptcy or similar proceeding
of any other Tenant in Common.

                11.8    In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between
the provisions of this Section 11 and any other provision of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 11 shall control.

        12.     POWER OF ATTORNEY. The Company shall at all times during the
term of this Agreement have a special and limited power of attorney as the
attorney-in-fact for any Tenant in Common whose Interest is to be purchased
pursuant to the option rights granted in Sections 7.3, 7.4, 8.1 and 9, with the
power and authority to act in the name and on behalf of each such Tenant in
Common to execute, acknowledge, and swear to in the execution, acknowledgment
and filing of documents that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement and which may include, but is not limited to, any contract for
purchase or sale of real estate, and any deed, deed of trust, mortgage, or other
instrument of conveyance or encumbrance, with respect to the Interests and/or
the Project or any other instrument or document that may be required to
effectuate the sale of the Project or an Interest.

                12.1    This power of attorney may be exercised by the Company
for such Tenant in Common by the signature of the Company acting as
attorney-in-fact for such Tenant in Common, or by such method as may be required
or requested in connection with the recording or filing of any instrument or
other document so executed.

                12.2    This power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall
survive an assignment by the Tenant in Common of all or any portion of its
Interest. Furthermore, this power of attorney shall survive the bankruptcy,
death, dissolution, liquidation, termination, incapacity or incompetency of the
Tenant in Common.

                12.3    The Company shall promptly furnish to Tenant in Common a
copy of any document executed by the Company pursuant to this power of attorney.

                2.1     STATUS OF THE PROPERTY MANAGER. The Tenants in Common
and the Property Manager do not intend to form a joint venture, partnership or
similar relationship. Instead, the parties intend that the Property Manager
shall act solely in the capacity of an independent contractor for the Tenants in
Common. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause the Property Manager and the
Tenants in Common to be joint venturers or partners of each other, and neither
shall have the power to bind or obligate the other party by virtue of this
Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall deprive or otherwise affect the right of either party to own,
invest in, manage, or operate, or to conduct business activities which compete
with the business of the Project.

                2.2     MANAGEMENT. The Property Manager shall manage, operate
and maintain the Project in an efficient, economic, and satisfactory manner and
shall arrange the performance of everything reasonably necessary for the proper
operation of the Project for the tenants thereof, subject to (a) applicable
governmental requirements and (b) the terms and provisions of this Agreement. At
the expense of the Tenants in Common, the Property Manager shall keep the
Project clean and in good repair, shall order and supervise the completion of
such repairs as may be required and shall generally do and perform, or cause to
be done or performed, all things necessary, required or desirable for the proper
and efficient management, operation, and maintenance of the Project; provided
the Tenants in Common, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Property
Manager, make available to the Property Manager such sums as are reasonably
necessary to pay the costs thereof. In addition to the foregoing, Property
Manager shall have exclusive responsibility for interfacing and communicating
with the owner and holder of any deed of trust upon the Project, including,
without limitation, Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp. (the

                                       1
<PAGE>

current holder of the deed of trust on the Project) and its successors and
assigns ("Citigroup"), and shall (i) make all day to day business decisions
customarily provided by a property manager and (ii) perform all services
customarily provided by a property manager, with respect to interfacing with a
lender, including, without limitation, designating changes in address, receiving
any and all notices including, without limitation default notices on behalf of
the Tenants in Common, requesting waivers of loan document provisions and
negotiating conditions to any such requested waivers that might be granted by
any such owner and holder, depositing rents or other revenues in any lockbox
account maintained under such loan documents, receiving into an operating
account to be maintained by Property Manager for the benefit of the Tenants in
Common all disbursements made out of any such lockbox to the Tenants in Common
as the borrower thereunder for the payment of operating expenses of the Project,
or otherwise to be made to or to the account of the Tenants in Common as such
borrower, requesting and receiving any amounts out of any reserve accounts or
escrow accounts maintained by such lender on account of repairs, capital
improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, real estate taxes and
assessments and insurance proceeds or otherwise. The Property Manager shall
perform all services in a diligent and professional manner.

                2.3     EMPLOYEES: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. The Property Manager
shall employ, directly or through third party contractors (e.g. employee leasing
company), at all times a sufficient number of capable employees to enable the
Property Manager to properly, adequately, safely and economically manage,
operate and maintain the Project. All matters pertaining to the supervision of
such employees shall be the responsibility of the Property Manager. All salaries
and benefits and positions of employees who perform work in connection with the
Project shall be consistent with the Budget (as defined in Section 2.5.1).

                2.4     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, MORTGAGES AND OTHER MATTERS.

                        2.4.1   The Property Manager shall use reasonable
efforts to comply with any deed of trust, mortgage or other loan documents
affecting the Project and all governmental requirements, including Board of Fire
Underwriters or other similar body, relative to the performance of its duties
hereunder and cause the Project to comply with any deed of trust, mortgage or
other loan documents affecting the Project and all governmental requirements,
including Board of Fire Underwriters or other similar body. Property Manager may
implement such procedures with respect to the Project as the Property Manager
may deem advisable for the more efficient and economic management and operation
thereof. The Property Manager shall pay from the Operating Account (defined in
Section 6.1) expenses incurred to remedy violations.

                        2.4.2   The Property Manager shall furnish to the
Tenants in Common, promptly after receipt, any notice of violation of any
governmental requirement or order issued by any governmental entity, any Board
of Fire Underwriters or other similar body against the Project, any notice of
default from the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust encumbering the Project
or any notice of termination or cancellation of any insurance policy.

                2.5     BUDGETS AND OPERATING PLAN.

                        2.5.1   The Property Manager shall prepare and submit to
the Tenants in Common annually an annual capital and operating budget ("Budget")
for the promotion, operation, leasing, repair, maintenance and improvement for
such calendar year. The Budget for the initial calendar year (2005) is attached
hereto as Exhibit "B" and is hereby approved by each Tenant in Common. The
Property Manager shall deliver each subsequent Budget for each subsequent
calendar year prior to December 15th of the calendar year before the budget
year, or as soon as possible thereafter. The Tenants in Common shall approve or
disapprove of the Budget as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Tenants in Common
Agreement and the Property Manager agrees to comply with the terms and
conditions of Section 2.3 of the Tenants in Common Agreement. The Property
Manager may proceed under the terms of the proposed Budget for items that are
not objected to and may take any action with respect to items not approved for
Permitted Expenditures (as defined in Section 2.5.2). In the event that the
items that are objected to are operational expenditures, as opposed to capital
expenditures, the Property Manager shall be entitled to operate the Project
using the prior year's budget until the approval is obtained. The Property
Manager shall provide the Tenants in Common with such information regarding the
Budget as may be, from time to time, reasonably requested by the Tenants in
Common. The Property Manager may at any time submit a revised Budget to the
Tenants in Common for their approval consistent with the terms of this Section.

                        2.5.2   The Property Manager shall charge all expenses
to the proper account as specified in the Budget, provided that the Property
Manager may reallocate savings from one line item to other line items. The
Property Manager shall submit (subject to the same procedures as set forth in
Section 2.5.1) a revised Budget to the Tenants in Common before making any
expenditure not within the Budget unless the expenditure is (a) less than Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000), or (b) is, in the Property Manager's reasonable
judgment, required to avoid personal injury, significant property damage, a
default under any loan encumbering the Project, a violation of applicable law or
the suspension of a service (collectively, "Permitted Expenditures").

                        2.5.3   During each calendar year, in the regular
quarterly reports sent to the Tenants in Common, the Property Manager shall
inform the Tenants in Common of any material increases in costs and expenses not
foreseen and not included in the Budget within a reasonable time after the
Property Manager learns of such changes.

                        2.5.4   Together with the submission of the Budget, the
Property Manager shall submit each year to the Tenants in Common for information
purposes only an operating plan for the general operation of the Project,
including a proposed list of improvements to the Project, general insurance
plan, marketing plan and plan for the general operation and maintenance of the
Project (the "Operating Plan"). The Property Manager may submit a revised
Operating Plan to the Tenants in Common at any time.

                        2.5.5   Any controversy between the parties hereto
arising out of or related to the Budget shall be settled as set forth in Section
2.2.2 of the Tenants in Common Agreement.

                        2.5.6   The Property Manager shall be required to

they would be contractually entitled. The Property Manager shall not lease any
space in the Project to itself or to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.

                        2.6.4   The Property Manager shall reasonably
investigate all prospective tenants, and shall not rent to persons not meeting
credit standards reasonable for the market. The Property Manager may obtain a

similar service ("Credit Check Companies"). The Property Manager shall retain
such information for the duration of the tenancy, and shall make it available to
the Tenants in Common upon reasonable notice, subject to compliance with any
confidentiality restrictions required by Credit Check Companies. The Property
Manager does not guarantee the accuracy of any such information or the financial
condition of any tenant.

                        2.6.5   The Property Manager and the Tenants in Common
agree that there shall be no discrimination against or segregation of any person
or group of persons on account of age, race, color, religion, creed, handicap,
sex or national origin in the leasing of the Project, nor shall the Tenants in
Common or the Property

                                       3
<PAGE>

Manager permit any such practice or practices of discrimination or segregation

any further consent, provided that the Property Manager follows the bidding
requirements set forth in this Section 2.9 for a capital expenditure in excess
of $50,000. All other capital expenditures other than Permitted Expenditures
shall be subject to submittal of a revised Budget to the Tenants in Common.
Unless the Tenants in Common specifically waive such requirements, or approve a
particular contract, the Property Manager shall award any contract for a capital
improvement exceeding $50,000 in cost on the basis of competitive bidding,
solicited from a minimum of two (2) written bids. The Property Manager shall
accept the bid of the lowest bidder determined by the Property Manager to be
responsible and qualified.

        3.      BASIC INSURANCE.

                3.1     INSURANCE.

                        3.1.1   The Property Manager, at the Tenants in Common's
expense, will obtain and keep in force adequate insurance against physical
damage (such as fire with extended coverage endorsement, boiler

                                       5
<PAGE>

and machinery) and against liability for loss, damage or injury to property or
persons that might arise out of the occupancy, management, operation or
maintenance of the Project, as contemplated by the Operating Plan and any loan
documents affecting the Project (including the Citigroup Loan Documents) and to
the extent available at commercially reasonable rates. The Property Manager
shall not be required to maintain earthquake or flood insurance unless expressly
directed to do so by a specific written notice from the Tenants in Common or as
required by any loan documents affecting the Project, but may do so in the
Property Manager's reasonable discretion. The Property Manager shall be a named
insured on all property damage insurance and an additional insured on all
liability insurance maintained with respect to the Project. In the event the
Property Manager receives insurance proceeds for the Project, the Property

affecting the Project. In the event that the Property Manager receives insurance
proceeds that are not governed by the terms of any loan documents affecting the
Project, the Property Manager will either (i) use such proceeds to replace,
repair or refurbish the Project or (ii) distribute such proceeds to the Tenants
in Common, as directed by the Tenants in Common. Any insurance proceeds

                        3.1.2   As part of the Operating Plan, the Property
Manager shall advise the Tenants in Common in writing and make recommendations
with respect to the proper insurance coverage for the Project, taking into
account the insurance requirements set forth in any deed of trust or mortgage on
the Project, shall furnish such information as the Tenants in Common may
reasonably request to obtain insurance coverage and shall reasonably aid and
cooperate with respect to such insurance and any loss thereunder. The Tenants in
Common acknowledge that the Property Manager is not a licensed insurance agent
or insurance expert. Accordingly, the Property Manager shall be entitled to rely
on the advice of a reputable insurance broker or consultant regarding the proper
insurance for the Project.

                        3.1.3   The Property Manager shall investigate and
submit, as soon as reasonably possible, a written report to the insurance
carrier and the Tenants in Common as to all accidents, claims for damage
relating to the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Project, any damage
to or destruction of the Project and the estimated costs of repair thereof, and
prepare and file with the insurance company in a timely manner required reports
in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Property Manager
shall not be required to give such notice to the Tenants in Common if the amount
of such claims, damage or destruction, as reasonably estimated by the Property
Manager, does not exceed $50,000 for any one occurrence. The Property Manager
shall settle all claims against insurance companies arising out of any policies,
including the execution of proofs of loss, the adjustment of losses, signing and
collection of receipts and collection of money, except that the Property Manager
shall not settle claims in excess of $50,000 without the prior approval of the
Tenants in Common as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Tenants in Common
Agreement.

                3.2     ADDITIONAL INSURANCE. Any insurance obtained by the
Property Manager for its own account and not for the benefit of the Tenants in
Common or the Project shall be at the Property Manager's own expense.

                3.3     CONTRACTOR'S AND SUBCONTRACTOR'S INSURANCE. The Property
Manager shall require all contractors and subcontractors entering upon the
Project to perform services to have insurance coverage at the contractor's or
subcontractor's expense, in the following minimum amounts: (a) worker's
compensation - statutory amount; (b) employer's liability (if required under
applicable law) - $500,000 (minimum); and (c) comprehensive general liability
insurance, including comprehensive auto liability insurance covering the use of
all owned, non-owned and hired automobiles, with bodily injury and property
damage limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence. The Property Manager may waive such
requirements in its reasonable discretion. The Property Manager shall obtain and
keep on file a certificate of insurance that shows that each contractor and
subcontractor is so insured.

                3.4     WAIVER OF SUBROGATION. To the extent available at
commercially reasonable rates, all property damage insurance policies required
hereunder shall contain language whereby the insurance carrier thereunder waives
any right of subrogation it may have with respect to the Tenants in Common or
the Property Manager.

                4.1     BOOKS OF ACCOUNTS. The Property Manager shall maintain
adequate and separate books and records for the Project with the entries

to the Project. Such books and records shall contain a separate allocation of
income and expenses to each Tenant in Common. The Tenants in Common agree to
provide to the Property Manager any financial or other information reasonably
requested by the Property Manager to carry out its services hereunder. The
Property Manager shall maintain such books and records at the Property Manager's
office at the Property Manager's address as set forth in Section 12 or at the
subcontractor to the Property Manager or at the Project or at a designated
office in the region of the Project. The Property Manager shall ensure such
control over accounting and financial transactions as is reasonably necessary to
protect the Tenants in Common's assets from theft, error or fraudulent activity
by the Property Manager's employees. The Property Manager shall bear losses
arising from such instances, including, without limitation, the following: (a)
theft of assets by the Property Manager's employees, principals, or officers or
those individuals associated or affiliated with the Property Manager; (b)
overpayment or duplicate payment of invoices arising from either fraud or gross
negligence, unless credit is subsequently received; (c) overpayment of labor
costs arising from either fraud or gross negligence, unless credit is
subsequently received by the Tenants in Common; (d) overpayment resulting from
payment from suppliers to the Property Manager's employees or associates arising
from the purchase of goods or services for the Project; and (e) unauthorized use
of facilities by the Property Manager or the Property Manager's employees or
associates.

                4.2     FINANCIAL REPORTS. On or about the forty-fifth (45th)
day following each quarter, the Property Manager shall furnish to the Tenants in
Common a report of all significant transactions occurring during the prior
quarter. These reports shall show all collections, delinquencies, uncollectible
items, vacancies and other matters pertaining to the management, operation, and
maintenance of the Project during the quarter. The Property Manager also shall
deliver to the Tenants in Common within a reasonable time after (i) the close of
a calendar year and (ii) the termination of this Agreement, a balance sheet for
the Project. The statement of income and expenses, the balance sheet, and all
other financial statements and reports shall be prepared on an accrual basis
according, to the extent possible, to generally accepted accounting principles
(except that footnote disclosures are not required). The Property Manager may,
but shall not be required, to obtain audited financial statements for the
Project. The Property Manager shall also comply with all reporting requirements
relating to the operation of the Project required under any deed of trust
affecting the Project.

                4.3     SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION. As additional support to the
quarterly financial statement, unless otherwise directed by the Tenants in
Common, and at the expense of the Tenants in Common, the Property Manager shall

Manager's address as set forth in Section 12 or at the subcontractor to the
Property Manager or at the Project or at a designated office in the region of
the Project the following: (a) all bank statements, bank deposit slips, bank
debit and credit memos, canceled checks, and bank reconciliations; (b) detailed
cash receipts and disbursement records; (c) detailed trial balance for
receivables and payables and billed and unbilled revenue items; (d) rent roll of

records; (i) information regarding the operation of the Project necessary for
preparation of the tax returns for the Tenants in Common; and (j) market study
of competition (quarterly only). The Property Manager shall deliver a copy of
the documents described in (a) through (j) above to any Tenant in Common upon
written request. The Property Manager shall maintain within such items separate
income and expense accounts for each Tenant in Common, where and as appropriate.

                4.4     TAX INFORMATION. The Property Manager shall provide the
Tenants in Common with sufficient information so that the Tenants in Common can
prepare their income tax returns with appropriate adjustments to convert the
information prepared on an accrual basis to the cash method of accounting.

        5.      RIGHT TO AUDIT. Each of the Tenants in Common and their
representatives may examine all books, records and files maintained for the
Tenants in Common by the Property Manager. The Tenants in Common may perform any
audit or investigations relating to the Property Manager's activities at any
office of the Property Manager if such audit or investigation relates to the
Property Manager's activities for the Tenants in Common. Should any of the
Tenants in Common discover defects in internal control or errors in record
keeping, the Property Manager shall undertake with all appropriate diligence to
correct such discrepancies either upon discovery or within

                                       7

a reasonable period of time. The Property Manager shall inform the Tenants in
Common in writing of the action taken to correct any audit discrepancies.

        6.      BANK ACCOUNTS.

                6.1     OPERATING ACCOUNT. To the extent funds are not required
to be placed in a lockbox pursuant to any loan documents affecting the Project,
the Property Manager shall deposit all rents and other funds collected from the
operation of the Project in a reputable bank or financial institution in a
special trust or depository account or accounts for the Project maintained by
the Property Manager for the benefit of the Tenants in Common. The Property
Manager shall maintain books and records of the funds deposited in the accounts
and withdrawals therefrom (including records of deposits and withdrawals
credited and charged to each Tenant in Common) (such accounts together with any
interest earned thereon, shall collectively be referred to herein as the
"Operating Account"). The Tenants in Common shall maintain the Operating Account
so that an amount at least as great as the budgeted expenses for such month is
in such Operating Account as of the first of each month. The Property Manager
shall pay from the Operating Account the operating expenses of the Project and
any other payments relative to the Project as required by this Agreement. If
more than one account is necessary to operate the Project, each account shall
have a unique name, except to the extent any Lender requires sub-accounts within
any account.

                6.2     SECURITY DEPOSIT ACCOUNT. If law or a Lender requires a
segregated account of security deposits, the Property Manager will open a
separate account at a reputable bank or other financial institution. The
Property Manager shall maintain such account in accordance with applicable law
and/or the applicable loan agreement. The Property Manager shall use the account
only to maintain security deposits. The Property Manager shall inform the bank
or financial institution to hold the funds in trust for the Tenants in Common.
The Property Manager shall maintain detailed records of all security deposits
deposited, and allow the Tenants in Common or its designees access to such
records. The Property Manager may return such deposits to any tenant in the
ordinary course of business in accordance with the terms of the applicable
lease.

                6.3     ACCESS TO ACCOUNT. As authorized by signature cards,
representatives of the Property Manager shall have access to and may draw upon
all funds in the accounts described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 without the approval
of the Tenants in Common. Additionally, representatives of the Property Manager
shall have access to and may draw upon any funds escrowed or held in reserve for
capital expenditures without the approval of the Tenants in Common, provided
that the requirements of Section 2.9 and any additional Lender requirements with
respect to such amounts are satisfied. The Tenants in Common may not withdraw
funds from such accounts without the Property Manager's signature except
following the Property Manager's default beyond any applicable notice and cure
period or the termination of this Agreement.

        7.      PAYMENTS OF EXPENSES. The Property Manager shall pay all
expenses of the operation, maintenance and repair with respect to the Project
contemplated by the Budget directly from the Operating Account or shall be
reimbursed by the Tenants in Common, subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 2, including the following: (a) costs of the gross salary and wages or
proportional shares thereof, payroll taxes, worker's compensation insurance, and
all other benefits of employees required to manage, operate and maintain the
Project properly, adequately, safely and economically, subject to this
Agreement, provided that the Property Manager shall not pay such employees in
advance; (b) cost to correct the violation of any governmental requirement
relating to the leasing, use, repair and maintenance of the Project, or relating
to the rules, regulations or orders of the local Board of Fire Underwriters or
other similar body, if such cost is not the result of the Property Manager's
gross negligence or willful misconduct; (c) actual and reasonable cost of making
all repairs, decorations and alterations if such cost is not the result of the
Property Manager's gross negligence or willful misconduct; (d) cost incurred by
the Property Manager in connection with all service agreements; (e) cost of

the cost of services, contractors and insurance; (r) reimbursement of the
Property Manager's out-of-pocket costs and expenses to the extent not prohibited
by Section 8; (s) general accounting and reporting services within the
reasonable scope of the Property Manager's responsibility to the Tenants in

                                       8

including personal computers located at the Property Manager's office off the
Project for preparation of reports, information and returns to be prepared by
the Property Manager under the terms of this Agreement; (v) cost of electronic

supplies (paper, envelopes, business forms, checks, payroll forms and record
cards, forms for governmental reports, etc.), printing, equipment, insurance,
fidelity bonds, taxes and license fees, and general office expenses allocable to
the Project. All other amounts payable with respect to the Project shall be
payable from the Operating Account only after a revised Budget has been
submitted to the Tenants in Common, as provided in this Agreement. If there are
not sufficient funds in the account to make any such payment, the Property
Manager shall notify the Tenants in Common, if possible, at least ten (10) days
prior to any delinquency so that the Tenants in Common have an opportunity to
deposit sufficient funds in the Operating Account to allow for such payment
before the imposition of any penalty or late charge. No later than the end of
the succeeding month, the Property Manager shall remit to the Tenants in Common
all unexpended funds for the prior month, except for reserves reflected in the
Budget or required by the Lender which shall remain in the Operating Account in
the amount equal to the expenses budgeted for the month in which the remittance
is to be made. Except with respect any expenses that are determined to be
properly allocable on other than a pro rata basis, all expenses of the Project
shall be allocated to the Tenants in Common on a pro rata basis.

        8.      PROPERTY MANAGER'S COSTS NOT TO BE REIMBURSED.

                8.1     NON-REIMBURSABLE COSTS. The following expenses or costs
incurred by or on behalf of the Property Manager in connection with the
management and leasing of the Project shall be at the sole cost and expense of
the Property Manager and shall not be reimbursed by the Tenants in Common: (a)
costs attributable to losses arising from gross negligence, willful misconduct
or fraud on the part of the Property Manager, the Property Manager's associates
or employees; and (b) cost of insurance purchased by the Property Manager for

insurance), discrimination or wrongful termination, including legal fees and
other expenses.

        9.      COMPENSATION.

                9.1     PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEE. The Property Manager shall
receive, for its services in managing the day-to-day operations of the Project
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, a monthly property management
fee (the "Property Management Fee") equal to three percent (3%) of the Gross
Revenues (defined below), which Property Management Fee shall be in addition to
the Asset Management Fee (defined in Section 9.2) and any out-of-pocket and
on-site personnel costs that are reimbursable pursuant to Section 7. "Gross
Revenues" shall be all gross billings from the operations of the Project
including rental receipts, lease buy-out payments, and reimbursements by tenants
for common area expenses, operating expenses and taxes and similar pass-through
obligations paid by tenants, but excluding (i) security deposits received from
tenants and interest accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant until such
deposits or interest are included in the taxable income of the Tenants in
Common; (ii) advance rents (but not lease buy-out payments) until the month in
which payments are to apply as rental income; (iii) reimbursements by tenants
for work done for that particular tenant, (iv) proceeds from the sale or other

capital, financing and any other transactions not in the ordinary course of the
operation of the Project, (ix) income derived from interest on investments or

domain, discounts and dividends on insurance policies, and (xi) rental
concessions not paid by third parties. The Property Management Fee shall be

prorate the Management Fee on a daily basis to the effective date of such
cancellation or termination. Upon a sale of the Project, the Property Manager
shall receive additional compensation equal to the previous month's Property
Management Fee as compensation for work to be performed in connection with the
sale or completion of managing matters relating to each tenant.

                9.2     ASSET MANAGEMENT FEE. The Property Manager shall
receive, for its services in supervising the overall management and operation of
the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, an annual asset
management fee (the "Asset Management Fee") equal to $180,000 for each calendar
year and pro rated for any partial year, which Asset Management Fee shall be in
addition to the Property Management Fee (defined in Section 9.1) and shall be
payable pro rata on a monthly basis on the first day of each month (or in the
case of the first partial month beginning on the date hereof a pro rata amount
payable on the date hereof) plus any out-of-pocket and on-site personnel costs
that are reimbursable pursuant to Section 7. The Property Manager may defer, in
its sole discretion, all or any portion of such annual Asset Management Fee. Any
such unpaid Asset Management Fees shall, in all event, be paid upon the earliest
to occur of the following events: (i) the termination of this Agreement, (ii)
the sale of the Project or (iii) 10 years from the accrual of any such unpaid
Asset Management Fee. Upon termination of this Agreement or upon a sale of the
Project, the parties will prorate the Asset Management Fee on a daily basis to
the effective date of such cancellation or termination. In the event the
Property Manager hires a local property manager to assist in the management of
the Project, the Property Manager will be responsible for the compensation of
such local property manager.

                9.3     LEASING COMMISSIONS. The Property Manager, or an
affiliate, shall receive, for its services in leasing the Project in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, a leasing commission (the "Leasing
Commission") as set forth on the Schedule of Leasing Commissions attached hereto
as Exhibit "C".

                9.4     CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FEE. The Property Manager, or an

amount of any loan obtained by or for the Tenants in Common; provided, however,
no separate financing fee shall be paid with respect to the original loan made
(or to be made immediately upon execution of this Agreement) by the Lender. This
fee will be payable to the Property Manager or its affiliate whether or not an
outside loan broker is used. The financing fee will be pro rated among the
Tenants in Common.

                9.6     SELLING COMMISSION. If, during the term of this
Agreement, the Tenants in Common determine to sell or exchange the Project, or
any portion thereof (including an undivided interest of a single Tenant in
Common in the event the Property Manager participates in such sale), the Tenants
in Common hereby grant the Property Manager, or an affiliate, for a 180-day
term, the right to participate in the marketing of the Project on terms
acceptable to the Tenants in Common. The Tenants in Common shall notify the
Property Manager in writing of the determination to sell or exchange, which
notification shall specify the commencement and termination date of such 180-day
term. If the Project is sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of as a result of
offers received during such 180-day term, and the Property Manager or its
designee, subcontractor or assignee participated in the sale, a commission
("Broker Fee") shall be paid by the Tenants in Common to the Property Manager
equal to two percent (2%) of the sales price. In addition to the foregoing, the
Property Manager may at any time negotiate with potential purchasers and submit
offers to purchase to the Tenants in Common for approval. If the Project is
sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of as a result of any such offers, the
Property Manager shall be entitled to a commission paid by the Tenants in Common
in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the sales price. If another broker
participates in the transaction, then the Property Manager may cooperate with
that broker, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Property Manager and
approved by the Tenants in Common, with commissions to the other broker to be
paid by the Tenants in Common. Notwithstanding the above, if there is a broker
fee paid to a third party broker, the total commission paid to the Property
Manager, or its affiliate, and the third party broker shall not exceed two
percent (2%).

                9.7     APPLICATION OF FEES. Each Tenant in Common shall be
responsible for his or her percentage share, based on percentage ownership
interests in the Project, of all of the fees set forth in this Agreement.

                9.8     AFFILIATE OF BEHRINGER. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 9, in the event that Behringer or any of its affiliates own an
interest in the Project and such party is subject to the National Association

                                       10

under such guidelines.

                10.1    TERMINATION BY THE TENANTS IN COMMON. This Agreement
shall terminate on December 31, 2030; provided, however, that this Agreement
shall terminate on December 31, 2004 and each anniversary of such date unless
all of the Tenants in Common consent to the extension of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 1.2.1.

                10.2    TERMINATION BY THE PROPERTY MANAGER.

                        10.2.1  The Property Manager shall have the right to

uncured for thirty (30) days following the Property Manager's giving of written
notice of such default to the Tenants in Common.

                        10.2.2  The Property Manager shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement for any reason upon 60 days written notice.

                10.3    FINAL ACCOUNTING. Within forty-five (45) days after
termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Property Manager shall: (a)
deliver to the Tenants in Common a final accounting, setting forth the balance
of income and expenses on the Project as of the date of termination; (b)
transfer to any account indicated by the Tenants in Common any balance or monies
of the Tenants in Common or tenant security deposits held by the Property
Manager with respect to the Project (or transfer the accounts in which such sums

subsequent property manager or other agent indicated by the Tenants in Common
all materials and supplies, keys, books and records, contracts, leases, receipts
for deposits, unpaid bills and other papers or documents that pertain to the

cancellation for any reason other than the Tenants in Common's default, the
Property Manager shall be available, through its senior executives familiar with
the Project, to consult with and advise the Tenants in Common or any person or
entity succeeding to the Tenants in Common as owner of the Project or such other
person or persons selected by the Tenants in Common regarding the operation and
maintenance of the Project. In addition, the Property Manager shall cooperate
with the Tenants in Common in notifying all tenants of the Project of the
expiration and termination of this Agreement, and shall use reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Tenants in Common to accomplish an orderly transfer of the
operation and management of the Project to a party designated by the Tenants in
Common. The Property Manager shall receive its monthly Management Fee for such
services. The Property Manager shall, at its cost and expense, promptly remove
all signs wherever located indicating that it is the Property Manager and
replace and repair any damage resulting therefrom. Termination of this Agreement
shall not release either party from liability for failure to perform any of the
duties or obligations as expressed herein and required to be performed by such
party for the period before the termination.

        11.     CONFLICTS. The Property Manager shall not deal with or engage,

                13.1    ASSIGNMENT. The Property Manager may not assign this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Tenants in Common, except
with respect to an assignment to an affiliate, including, but not limited to a
wholly-owned subsidiary, which shall be permissible under this Agreement, which
consent may be withheld in the Tenants in Common's sole and absolute discretion;
provided, however, that the Property Manager may assign, subcontract or delegate
the day-to-day management responsibilities, leasing services and/or disposition
services to one or more local property managers or leasing companies so long as
the Property Manager continues to supervise the overall management of the
Project and provide other customary asset management services. Subject to the
Tenants in Common Agreement, a Tenant in Common may assign its rights under this
Agreement to a party acquiring its undivided interest ("Successor Tenant in
Common"). A Successor Tenant in Common shall take such interest subject to this
Agreement, and the Tenant in Common and Successor Tenant in Common shall execute
an agreement whereby (i) the assigning Tenant in Common assigns to the Successor
Tenant in Common all of its right, title and interest in and to this Agreement;
and (ii) the Successor Tenant in Common assumes and agrees to perform faithfully
and to be bound by all of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions and
agreements of this Agreement with respect to the undivided interest to be
transferred. Upon execution of such assignment and assumption agreement, the

effective date of the assignment and, without further action by the Property
Manager or the other Tenants in Common, the Successor Tenant in Common shall
become a party to this Agreement.

                13.2    GENDER. Each gender shall include each other gender. The
singular shall include the plural and vice-versa.

                13.3    AMENDMENTS. Except as otherwise provided, each
amendment, addition or deletion to this Agreement shall not be effective unless
approved by the parties in writing. Except for amendments occurring as a result
of a transfer of a Tenant in Common Interest that is made pursuant to the
Citigroup Loan Documents, any amendment to this Agreement must be consented to
in writing by Citigroup, and, after securitization of the Citigroup Loan, from
each rating agency that provides a rating in connection with the Citigroup Loan
unless the Property Manager shall have provided written confirmation from each
rating agency that provides a rating in connection with the Citigroup Loan that
such amendment shall not result in any withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of
such rating. Citigroup is expressly intended to be a third party beneficiary of
this Section and shall have the right to enforce the obligations of the parties
hereunder.

                13.4    ATTORNEYS' FEES. In any action or proceeding between the
Property Manager and the Tenants in Common arising from or relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement or interpretation hereof, the party prevailing in
such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all
of its reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses of the action or
proceeding.

Agreement shall be brought only in a court of competent jurisdiction located in

provision of this Agreement.

                13.8    REPRESENTATIONS. The Property Manager represents and
warrants that it is fully qualified and licensed, to the extent required by law,
to manage and lease real estate and perform all obligations assumed by the
Property Manager hereunder. The Property Manager shall use reasonable efforts to

                13.9    INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PROPERTY MANAGER.

                        13.9.1  The Property Manager shall indemnify, defend and
hold the Tenants in Common and their shareholders, officers, directors, and
employees harmless from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses,
damages, fines, penalties, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs, sustained or incurred by or asserted against
the Tenants in Common by reason of the acts of the Property Manager which arise
out of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Property
Manager, its agents or employees or the Property Manager's breach of this
Agreement. If any person or entity makes a claim or institutes a suit against
the Tenants in Common on a matter for which the Tenants in Common claim the
benefit of the foregoing indemnification, then (a) the Tenants in Common shall
give the Property Manager prompt notice thereof in writing; (b) the Property
Manager may defend such claim or action by counsel of its own choosing provided
such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Tenants in Common; and (c)
neither the Tenants in Common nor the Property Manager shall settle any claim
without the other's written consent.
13.9.2 The Property Manager acknowledges that the Tenants in Common have or will
be entering into loan documents, which may include provisions for personal
liability for the Tenants in Common on certain "nonrecourse carve-outs." The
Property Manager hereby agrees that to the extent that the Tenants in Common are
required to make payments on such indemnification as a direct result of (i) the
Property Manager's fraud, willful misconduct or misappropriation, (ii) the
Property Manager's commission of a criminal act, (iii) the misapplication by
Property Manager of any funds derived from the Project received by the Property
Manager, including any failure to apply such proceeds in accordance with the
requirements of any existing loan documents applicable to the Project, or (iv)
damage or destruction to the Project caused by acts of the Property Manager that
are grossly negligent, the Property Manager will indemnify the Tenants in Common
for any such liability that was caused by such actions.

                13.10   INDEMNIFICATION BY THE TENANTS IN COMMON. The Tenants in
Common shall indemnify, defend and hold the Property Manager and its
shareholders, officers, directors and employees harmless from any and all
claims, demands, causes of action, losses, damages, fines, penalties,
liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court
costs, sustained or incurred by or asserted against the Property Manager by
reason of the operation, management, and maintenance of the Project and the
performance by the Property Manager of the Property Manager's obligations under
this Agreement but only to the extent of each Tenants in Common's interest in
the Project, except those which arise from the Property Manager's gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud. If any person or entity makes a claim
or institutes a suit against the Property Manager on matter for which the
Property Manager claims the benefit of the foregoing indemnification, then (a)
the Property Manager shall give the Tenants in Common prompt notice thereof in
writing; (b) the Tenants in Common may defend such claim or action by counsel of
their own choosing provided such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the
Property Manager; (c) neither the Property Manager nor the Tenants in Common
shall settle any claim without the other's written consent; and (d) this
subsection shall not be so construed as to release the Tenants in Common or the
Property Manager from any liability to the other for a breach of any of the
covenants agreed to be performed under the terms of this Agreement. Each Tenant
in Common agrees that this Section 13.10 is subject and subordinate to the
Citigroup Loan Documents and the liens created thereby and to all rights of
Citigroup thereunder.

                13.11   COMPLETE AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall supersede and
take the place of any and all previous agreements entered into between the
parties with respect to the Project.

                13.12   SEVERABILITY. If any provisions of this Agreement or
application to any party or circumstances shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable to any extent, the
remainder of this Agreement, where the application of such provisions or
circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid or
unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each provision hereof shall be
valid and shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

                13.13   NO WAIVER. The failure by either party to insist upon
the strict performance of or to seek remedy of any one of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement or to exercise any right, remedy, or election set
forth herein or permitted by law shall not constitute or be construed as a
waiver or relinquishment for the future of such term, condition, right, remedy
or election, but such item shall continue and remain in full force and effect.
All rights or remedies of the parties specified in this Agreement and all other
rights or remedies that they may have at law, in equity or otherwise shall be
distinct, separate and cumulative rights or remedies, and no one of them,
whether exercised or not, shall be deemed to be in exclusion of any other right
or remedy of the parties.

                13.14   BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall be binding and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

                13.15   ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROPERTY MANAGER'S RIGHTS. In the
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, the Property Manager shall not
seek or obtain a money judgment or any other right or remedy against any
shareholders or disclosed or undisclosed principals of the Tenants in Common.
The Property Manager shall enforce its rights and remedies solely against the
estate of the Tenants in Common in the Project or the proceeds of any sale of
all or any portion of the Tenants in Common's interest therein.

                13.16   COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, and all so executed shall constitute one Agreement, binding on all
of the parties hereto, notwithstanding that all of the parties are not signatory
to the original or the same counterpart.

        14.     SPECIAL LENDER PROVISIONS.

                14.1    The Tenants in Common hereby grant to Property Manager
the power and authority (i) to discuss with the owner and holder of the
Citigroup Loan (as hereinafter defined) ("Lender") in connection with all
matters arising under the Loan Documents (as hereinafter defined) that involve
the Project and its management, on behalf of the Tenants in Common, and (ii) to
carry out all of Property Manager's obligations, authority and duties under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 2. The
Property Manager is expressly empowered and authorized to make disbursement
requests from, and to receive draws or disbursements from all reserve accounts
established under the Loan Documents on behalf of Tenants in Common and to
receive disbursements from any lockboxes on behalf of Tenants in Common. Each
Tenant in Common by its execution or assumption hereof acknowledges and confirms
the authorization hereby expressly given to Lender to confer with Property
Manager on all matters arising under the Loan Documents insofar as they relate
to the management and operation of the Property and the obligations of the
Tenants in Common to Lender in connection therewith, Lender may rely upon the
provisions of this Section 14.1, and the actions of the Property Manager taken
pursuant thereto, without further inquiry, and Tenants in Common shall be bound
by any such action Property Manager may take; provided, however, that nothing
set forth herein shall excuse the Property Manager from obtaining the consent of
the Tenants in Common if required hereunder or pursuant to the Tenants in Common
Agreement.

                14.2    In addition, the power and authority granted by the
Tenants in Common shall include the power and authority to execute, acknowledge,
swear to the execution, acknowledgment of and the filing of documents involving
the ownership, financing, management, and operation of the Project consistent
with this Agreement and the Tenants in Common Agreement, and any and all such
other documents as may be necessary to implement the management powers of
Property Manager set forth in this Agreement and the Tenants in Common
Agreement.

                14.3    Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Section
14, as between Property Manager, on the one hand, and Tenants in Common, on the
other hand, this power and authority shall in no event empower Property Manager
to purchase, transfer, sell, exchange or encumber the Project or execute any
document or instrument for any Tenant in Common.

<PAGE>

                14.4    The Property Manager may exercise the power and
authority set forth in this Agreement by facsimile signature.

                14.5    Each Tenant in Common and Property Manager hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp. is making a
loan of up to $37,000,000 (the "Citgroup Loan") to be secured by a deed of trust
upon the Project and that for all purposes hereunder such deed of trust shall
qualify as and be the first lien deed of trust encumbering the Project.

                14.6    Each of the Tenants in Common and the Property Manager
hereby acknowledges and agrees that its rights and remedies provided for
anywhere in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights of
indemnity or defense provided for above, and any and all fees payable hereunder
are subject and subordinate as to payment and in all other respects to the terms
and provisions of and the liens and interests of the Citigroup Loan and the
documents and instruments evidencing, securing or governing the Lender Loan
(collectively, the "Loan Documents"); provided, however, that nothing set forth
herein shall prohibit the current payment of amounts due under this Agreement.
Each of the Tenants in Common and the Property Manager hereby waives during the
term of the Citigroup Loan any and all lien rights that it may have against any
Tenant in Common's undivided interest or in the Property as a whole as a result
of any default hereunder or for the payment of any sum due hereunder. In
addition, each of the Tenants in Common and the Property Manager hereby
irrevocably agrees to stand still and not to enforce any of its rights or
remedies hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, by
bringing any legal action or proceeding (including, without limitation, any
involuntary bankruptcy proceeding) or by prosecuting any claim in any
foreclosure proceeding or other legal action or proceeding commenced by Lender,
until the Citigroup Loan has been indefeasibly paid in full. Each of the Tenants
in Common and the Property Manager agrees that all applicable statutes of
limitation shall be tolled during any such stand still period. Each of the
Tenants in Common and the Property Manager hereby irrevocably assigns to Lender,
during the term of the Citigroup Loan, its right to vote in any bankruptcy or
similar proceeding of any other Tenant in Common or Property Manager. Each of
the Tenants in Common and Property Manager hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere set forth in this Agreement,
Lender is an intended third-party beneficiary of the terms and provisions of
this Section 14, that this Section 14 may be enforced by Lender and that the
terms and provisions of this Section 14 may not be terminated or modified
without the prior written consent of Lender in its sole and absolute discretion,
until the Citigroup Loan has been indefeasibly paid in full.

                14.7    Each Tenant in Common hereby designates Property Manager
as the party to receive all notices (including but not limited to service of
process) on behalf of the Tenants in Common pursuant to the Loan Documents,
including all notices from the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust secured
by the Project pursuant to the Citigroup Loan Documents. Property Manager shall
have the right to communicate with Citigroup on behalf of the Tenants in Common
and to handle all matters as directed by the Tenants in Common under the terms
of the Citigroup Loan Documents. Without limitation of the foregoing, Property
Manager shall provide to Citigroup all reports and other information required
pursuant to the terms of the Citigroup Loan Documents and request the approval
of Citigroup for any matters requiring such approval in accordance with the
terms of the Citigroup Loan Documents. All reporting covenants contained in the
Citigroup Loan Documents, while constituting the obligation of the Tenants in
Common thereunder, shall be performed by Property Manager on behalf of the
Tenants in Common.

                14.8    This Agreement and all of the terms and provisions
hereof shall in all respects be subject to and subordinate to the terms of the
Citigroup Loan Documents.

                                   EXHIBIT "B"

<PAGE>

                                   EXHIBIT "C"

                               LEASING COMMISSIONS

        (1)     For new leases (collectively, "Leases") or expansions of Leases
that are not co-brokered, six percent (6%) of first year base rent, four percent
(4%) of second and third year base rent, three percent (3%) of fourth and fifth
year base rent and two percent (2%) of all subsequent years base rent (such
commission rates referred to herein as the "Baltimore Rates").

        (2)     For new Leases or expansions of Leases that are co-brokered, the
Property Manager receives one-half (1/2) of the Baltimore Rates and the
co-broker receives the full Baltimore Rates (the net being 1.5 times the
Baltimore Rates).

        (3)     Two percent (2%) of base rent of Lease extensions and renewals
that are not co-brokered.

        (3)     Two percent (2%) of base rent of Lease extensions and renewals
that are co-brokered and an additional two percent (2%) to the co-broker (unless
otherwise agreed by the Property Manager to be lesser with no reduction retained
by the Property Manager, or agreed by the Tenants in Common to be greater).

        (4)     For the purpose of computing any leasing commission due and
payable hereunder, the term "base rent" shall mean the fixed or minimum rent
stated in the Lease in question (regardless of how such rent is denominated),
but excluding the following items of additional rent (regardless of how such
items are denominated and whether or not they are identified separately from the
fixed rent under such Lease or payable as part of, or an increase in, the fixed
rent):

        (a)     any additional rent payable pursuant to any escalation provision
                in such Lease and representing the Lessee's share of owner's
                operating costs and expenses, real estate taxes, utilities,
                insurance and the like or any increase therein, including any
                such escalation provision which is determined on the basis of a
                consumer price or other index;

        (b)     any additional rent representing reimbursement to owner for
                electricity, gas, oil or other utility charges or service paid
                by the owner in respect to the lessee's leased space which are
                not to be provided by the owner during regular building hours
                pursuant to the applicable standard form of lease;

        (c)     any additional rent representing an amortization of the lessee's
                contribution to the owner for tenant finish which is
                non-standard tenant finish or unique to a specific lessee's use
                or occupancy, or any increase in the base rent (over the
                prevailing base rent quoted by the owner to other prospective
                lessees) which represents an amortization of the cost of such
                tenant finish;

        (d)     any service charge or late charge; and

        (e)     any security deposit or payment of rent in advance as security.

        (5)     The Property Manager shall be entitled to receive the leasing
commissions specified herein with respect to any new Lease for which it
commenced negotiations during the term of this Agreement, provided that (i) the
Property Manager lists such Lessee as a prospect in a certificate delivered to
owners within forty-five (45) days after the termination of this Agreement and
(ii) such Lease is executed and delivered by the lessee and the owner within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the termination of this Agreement (or such
longer period not to exceed one (1) year following termination of this Agreement
if, as of the end of the 180 day period, active negotiations continue with a
prospect and those negotiations culminate in the execution of a Lease). The
owner or its then acting property manager or leasing agent shall negotiate in
good faith with the lessee or prospective lessee in question in an effort to
consummate the Lease in question within said 180 day period.

        (6)     Leasing commissions due with respect to new leases shall be
payable fifty percent (50%) upon the execution of the Lease by both the owner
and the lessee and receipt by the owner of any required security deposit

<PAGE>

and fifty percent (50%) within ten (10) days of the date the lessee accepts its
leased premises, as confirmed by a commencement date agreement or other similar
writing. Leasing commissions with respect to extensions, renewals or expansions
shall be payable upon the execution by both the owner and lessee of the
amendment or other instrument effecting such extension, renewal or expansion,
provided that if a lessee exercises a unilateral extension, renewal or expansion
right contained in its Lease and no further instrument is required to effect
such extension, renewal or expansion, the leasing commission shall be payable
upon the lessee's exercise of such right.

        (7)     Unless otherwise agreed for a specific Lease, if a Lease
provides that the lessee shall have the right to cancel the Lease prior to the
expiration of the term thereof, the leasing commission payable with respect
thereto shall be computed only upon the noncancellable portion of the term. If
the lessee elects not to cancel the Lease an additional leasing commission shall
be determined and computed for the balance of the term and shall be payable when
the right to cancel expires. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the lessee's
cancellation right obligates the lessee to repay the leasing commission for the
cancelled portion of the Lease term to the owner upon cancellation, then the
owner shall pay the Property Manager the full leasing commission as if there was
no right to cancel contained in the Lease.

hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the "PROPERTY."

        1.3     PURCHASE PRICE. Seller is to sell and Purchaser is to purchase
the Property for the amount of Fifty-Two Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
and No/100 Dollars ($52,750,000.00) (the "PURCHASE PRICE"); provided, however,
if (a) Purchaser exercises the Equity Transfer Election (as defined in Section
4.8), (b) the parties agree upon the terms of an Equity Transfer, as defined in
and contemplated by Section 4.8 hereof, (c) the parties close the transaction as
an Equity Transaction and (d) if as a result thereof, there is no transfer tax
or similar tax payable in connection with the transaction contemplated in this
Agreement, then the Purchase Price shall be Fifty-Two Million Six Hundred
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($52,600,000.00).

        1.4     PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price, as increased or
decreased by prorations and adjustments as herein provided, shall be payable in
full at Closing in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser prior to the Closing.

        1.5     DEPOSIT. Within three (3) business days after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deposit with Partners Title Company
(the "ESCROW AGENT" or the "TITLE COMPANY"), having its office at 712 Main
Street, Suite 2000E, Houston, Texas 77002-3215 (Attention: Karen Highfield) the
sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,500,000.00) (the
"INITIAL DEPOSIT") in good funds, either by certified bank or cashier's check or
by federal wire transfer. Purchaser agrees that Three Hundred Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($300,000.00) of the Initial Deposit shall be non-refundable
except as otherwise provided herein. On or prior to September 9, 2004, Purchaser
shall deposit with Escrow Agent the sum of One Million and

<PAGE>

No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "FIRST ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT") in good funds,
either by certified bank or cashiers check or by federal wire transfer. On or
prior to October 11, 2004, Purchaser shall deposit with Escrow Agent the sum of
One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "SECOND ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT")
in good funds, either by certified bank or cashiers check or by federal wire
transfer. On or prior to November 9, 2004, Purchaser shall deposit with Escrow
Agent the sum of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "THIRD
ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT") in good funds, either by certified bank or cashiers check
or by federal wire transfer. The Initial Deposit, together with the First
Additional Deposit, the Second Additional Deposit and the Third Additional
Deposit, and all interest earned thereon is collectively called the "DEPOSIT").
The Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit in an interest-bearing account
reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. All interest on such sum shall be deemed income of
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all costs and
fees imposed on the Deposit account. The Deposit shall be delivered to Seller
and applied against the Purchase Price at Closing or otherwise distributed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The failure of Purchaser to timely
deliver any Deposit hereunder shall be a material default, and shall entitle
Seller, at Seller's sole option, to exercise the remedies provided in Section
6.1 hereof, including without limitation to receive the Initial Deposit as
liquidated damages. Prior to expiration of the Inspection Period, the escrow
established pursuant to the Agreement shall be deemed to be a "sole order"
escrow, and Escrow Agent shall disburse the Deposit to Purchaser upon Escrow
Agent's receipt of any notice of termination prior to expiration of the
Inspection Period, without liability to Seller and notwithstanding any objection
by Seller to such disbursement.

        1.6     ESCROW AGENT. Escrow Agent shall hold and dispose of the Deposit
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser agree that
the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are purely ministerial in nature and
shall be expressly limited to the safekeeping and disposition of the Deposit in
accordance with this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall incur no liability in
connection with the safekeeping or disposition of the Deposit for any reason
other than Escrow Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence. In the event
that Escrow Agent shall be in doubt as to its duties or obligations with regard
to the Deposit, or in the event that Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions from Purchaser and Seller with respect to the Deposit, Escrow Agent
shall not be required to disburse the Deposit and may, at its option, continue
to hold the Deposit until both Purchaser and Seller agree as to its disposition,
or until a final judgment is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
directing its disposition, or Escrow Agent may interplead the Deposit in
accordance with the laws of the state in which the Property is located.

        Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any interest on the Deposit
except as is actually earned, or for the loss of any interest resulting from the
withdrawal of the Deposit prior to the date interest is posted thereon.

        Escrow Agent shall execute this Agreement solely for the purpose of
being bound by the provisions of Sections 1.5 and 1.6 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                TITLE AND SURVEY

        2.1     TITLE REVIEW PERIOD. During the period beginning upon the
Effective Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (local time at the Property) on August
27, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "TITLE REVIEW PERIOD"), Purchaser shall
have the right to review (a) a current preliminary title report on the Real
Property prepared by the Title Company which title report shall be obtained by
Purchaser and provided to Seller within five (5) days after the Effective Date;
and (b) Seller's existing survey of the Real Property (the "SURVEY"), which
Seller has delivered to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date. Purchaser may
obtain an updated survey of the Real Property (the "UPDATED SURVEY"). Purchaser
shall provide a copy of any Updated Survey to Seller upon Purchaser's receipt of
same.

        2.2     TITLE EXAMINATION. Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing (the
"TITLE NOTICE") prior to the expiration of the Title Review Period which
exceptions to title (including survey matters), if any, will not be accepted by
Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to notify Seller in writing of its disapproval of
any exceptions to title by the expiration of the Title Review Period, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have approved the condition of title to the Real Property. If
Purchaser notifies Seller in writing that Purchaser objects to any exceptions to
title, Seller shall have three (3) days after receipt of the Title Notice to
notify Purchaser (a) that Seller will remove such objectionable exceptions from
title on or before the Closing; provided that Seller may extend the Closing for
such period as shall be required to effect such cure, but not beyond thirty (30)
days; or (b) that Seller elects not to cause such exceptions to be removed;
provided that Seller shall pay or discharge any monetary liens created, assumed
or consented to by Seller. The procurement by Seller of a commitment for the
issuance of the Title Policy (as defined in Section 4.6 hereof) or an
endorsement thereto insuring Purchaser against any title exception which was
disapproved pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be deemed a cure by Seller of
such disapproval subject to Purchaser's reasonable approval thereof. If Seller
gives Purchaser notice under clause (b) above, Purchaser shall have until the
expiration of the Title Review Period in which to notify Seller that Purchaser
will nevertheless proceed with the purchase and take title to the Property
subject to such exceptions, or that Purchaser will terminate this Agreement. If
Purchaser shall fail to notify Seller of its election on or before the
expiration of the Title Review Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected
to terminate this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated or deemed
terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then neither
party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder (except for those
obligations of either party that expressly survive the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement), Three Hundred
Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($300,000.00) of the Deposit shall be paid to Seller
and the balance of the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and each party
shall bear its own costs incurred hereunder.

        2.3     PRE-CLOSING "GAP" TITLE DEFECTS. Between the expiration of the
Title Review Period and prior to Closing, Purchaser may notify Seller in writing
(the "GAP NOTICE") of any objections to title (a) that did not exist prior to
the expiration of the Title Review Period and are not due to acts done or
suffered by or through Purchaser and (b) are raised by the Title Company between
the expiration of the Title Review Period and the Closing. provided that

<PAGE>

Purchaser must notify Seller of such objection to title within two (2) business
days of being made aware of the existence of such exception. If Purchaser sends
a Gap Notice to Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall have the same rights and
obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section
2.2 hereof, unless such new matter was created by Seller or with Seller's
consent, in which case, Seller shall satisfy Purchaser's objections relating
thereto at or prior to Closing.


                                  ARTICLE III

                               REVIEW OF PROPERTY


        3.1     RIGHT OF INSPECTION. During the period beginning upon the
Effective Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (local time at the Property) on September
8, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "INSPECTION PERIOD"), Purchaser shall
have the right to make a physical inspection of the Real Property, including an
inspection of the environmental condition thereof pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and to examine at the Property (or the property
manager's office) all documents and files concerning the leasing, maintenance
and operation of the Property, including expense budgets and accounting and tax
records to the extent related to the operation of the Property, but excluding
Seller's partnership or corporate records, internal memoranda, operating and
revenue budgets, accounting and tax records, appraisals, financial projections
and similar proprietary, confidential or privileged information (collectively,
the "CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS"). Purchaser has advised Seller that Purchaser must
cause to be prepared three (3) years of audited financial statements in respect
of the Property in accordance with the policies of Purchaser and certain laws
and regulations including, without limitation, Securities and Exchange
Commission Regulation S-X, 3-14. Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to
provide to Purchaser such financial statements and supporting documentation as
are necessary for Purchaser's auditors to prepare such audited financial
statements, provided such cooperation on the part of Seller shall impose no
liability on Seller.

        Purchaser understands and agrees that any on-site inspections of the
Property shall occur at reasonable times agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser
after reasonable prior written notice to Seller and shall be conducted so as not
to interfere unreasonably with the use of the Property by Seller or its tenants.
Seller reserves the right to have a representative present during any such
inspections. If Purchaser desires to do any invasive testing at the Property,
Purchaser shall do so only after notifying Seller and obtaining Seller's prior
written consent thereto, which consent may be subject to any terms and
conditions imposed by Seller in its sole discretion. Purchaser shall promptly
restore the Property to its condition prior to any such inspections or tests, at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense. At Seller's option, Purchaser will furnish to
Seller copies of any reports received by Purchaser relating to any inspections
of the Property. Purchaser agrees to protect, indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless from and against any claim for liabilities, losses, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), damages or injuries arising out of or
resulting from the inspection of the Property by Purchaser or its agents or
consultants (excluding discovery of condition), and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, such obligation to indemnify and hold harmless
Seller shall survive Closing or any

<PAGE>

termination of this Agreement. Unless legally required to report a condition
that is revealed by inspections, Purchaser shall not contact any governmental
authority without first obtaining the prior written consent of Seller thereto
and Seller, at Seller's election, shall be entitled to have a representative on
any telephone call or other contact made by Purchaser to a governmental
authority and to be present at any meeting between Purchaser and a governmental
authority. The foregoing shall not, however, prevent Purchaser from contacting
governmental authorities to request zoning and code compliance letters for
customary due diligence and shall not prohibit Purchaser from reviewing or
requesting copies of public files relating to the Property. Purchaser shall
maintain and shall assure that its contractors maintain public liability and
property damage insurance in amounts and in form and substance adequate to
insure against all liabilities of Purchaser and its agents, employees or
contractors arising out of any entry upon or inspection of the Property pursuant
to the provisions hereof and concurrently with the execution hereof, Purchaser
shall provide Seller with evidence of such insurance coverage naming Seller as
an additional insured party thereunder.

        3.2     REPORTS. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (1) PURCHASER HAS RECEIVED
COPIES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING AND OTHER REPORTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE
"REPORTS") LISTED ON EXHIBIT P ATTACHED HERETO, (2) IF SELLER DELIVERS ANY
ADDITIONAL REPORTS TO PURCHASER, PURCHASER WILL ACKNOWLEDGE IN WRITING THAT IT
HAS RECEIVED SUCH REPORTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT THEREOF, AND (3) ANY REPORTS
DELIVERED OR TO BE DELIVERED BY SELLER OR ITS AGENTS OR CONSULTANTS TO PURCHASER
ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE SOLELY AS AN ACCOMMODATION TO PURCHASER AND MAY NOT BE
RELIED UPON BY PURCHASER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY.
PURCHASER AGREES THAT SELLER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER
FOR ANY INACCURACY IN OR OMISSION FROM ANY REPORT. PURCHASER HAS CONDUCTED, OR
WILL CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE INSPECTION PERIOD, ITS OWN
INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY TO THE EXTENT PURCHASER DEEMS
SUCH AN INVESTIGATION TO BE NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE.

        3.3     RIGHT OF TERMINATION. If for any reason whatsoever Purchaser
determines that the Property or any aspect thereof is unsuitable for Purchaser's
acquisition, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, in its
sole discretion and for any reason or no reason by giving written notice thereof
to Seller prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, and if Purchaser
gives such notice of termination on or prior to the expiration of the Inspection
Period, this Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then Three Hundred Thousand and
No/100 Dollars of the Deposit shall be paid to Seller and the balance of the
Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and, thereupon, neither party shall have
any further rights or obligations hereunder (except for those obligations that
expressly survive the termination of this Agreement). If Purchaser fails to give
Seller a notice of termination prior to the expiration of the Initial Review
Period or the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved all
aspects of the Property (except title and survey, which shall be governed by
Article II hereof)

<PAGE>

and to have elected to proceed with the purchase of the Property pursuant to the
terms hereof, subject to all conditions to Closing otherwise specified herein.

        3.4     REVIEW OF TENANT ESTOPPELS. After October 15, 2004, Seller shall
deliver to each tenant of the Property an estoppel certificate in substantially
the form of EXHIBIT D attached hereto (each, an "ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE"), and
shall request that the tenants complete and sign the Estoppel Certificates and
return them to Seller. Seller shall deliver copies of the completed Estoppel
Certificates to Purchaser as Seller receives them.

        3.5     SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENTS. Seller
agrees to cooperate with Purchaser to obtain subordination, non-disturbance and
attornment agreements ("SNDAS") from tenants under Leases selected by
Purchaser's lender. As and when received by Seller, Seller shall deliver the
executed SNDAs to Purchaser. If the transaction contemplated herein fails to
close for any reason whatsoever, Purchaser shall return to Seller all such
executed SNDAs previously delivered to Purchaser. The failure to obtain SNDAs
from all or any of the selected tenants shall not constitute a default by Seller
hereunder or otherwise entitle Purchaser to terminate this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                     CLOSING

hereby (the "CLOSING") shall be held at the Chicago offices of Piper Rudnick LLP
on December 1, 2004 (the "CLOSING DATE"). At the Closing, Seller and Purchaser
shall perform the obligations set forth in, respectively, Section 4.2 and
Section 4.3 hereof, the performance of which obligations shall be concurrent
conditions. At Seller's option, the Closing shall be consummated through an
escrow administered by Escrow Agent. In such event, the Purchase Price and all
documents shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, as escrowee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, by delivering, at least three (3) business days prior to the
original Closing Date, to Seller a written notice ("EXTENSION NOTICE").
Purchaser may elect to extend the Closing Date to a date no later than December

Notice.

                (b)     deliver to Purchaser a duly executed bill of sale
        (collectively, the "BILL OF SALE") conveying the Personal Property

        form attached hereto as EXHIBIT F;

        forth in Sections 5.7(a) or (b) hereof which results from any change

        and 4.3(l) (the "CLOSING STATEMENT") on or before the date that is five
        (5) business days prior to the Closing Date. If Seller fails to deliver
        such draft Closing Statement on or before such date, such failure

<PAGE>

        shall not constitute a default by Seller hereunder or otherwise entitle
        Purchaser to terminate this Agreement.

                (b)     All income and expenses of the Property shall be
        apportioned as of 12:01 a.m., on the Closing Date, as if Purchaser were
        vested with title to the Property during the entire day upon which
        Closing occurs. Such prorated items shall include without limitation the
        following:

                        (i)     all Rents;

                        (ii)    taxes and assessments (including personal
                property taxes on the Personal Property) levied against the
                Property;

                        (iii)   utility charges for which Seller is liable, if
                any, such charges to be apportioned at Closing on the basis of
                the most recent meter reading occurring prior to Closing (dated
                not more than fifteen (15) days prior to Closing) or, if
                unmetered, on the basis of a current bill for each such utility;

                        (iv)    all amounts payable under Operating Agreements;
                and

                        (v)     any other operating expenses or other items
                pertaining to the Property which are customarily prorated
                between a purchaser and a seller in the county in which the
                Property is located.

                (c)     In addition to and notwithstanding anything contained in
        Section 4.4(b) hereof:

                        (i)     At Closing, (A) Seller shall, at Seller's
                option, either deliver to Purchaser any Security Deposits
                provided under the Leases or credit to the account of Purchaser
                the amount of such Security Deposits (to the extent such
                Security Deposits have not been applied against delinquent Rents
                or otherwise as provided in the Leases, any amounts so supplied
                being disclosed to Purchaser in writing with a representation by
                Seller that the tenant who posted such applied Security Deposit
                is not entitled to a refund of the applied amount), and (B)
                Purchaser shall credit to the account of Seller all refundable
                cash or other deposits posted with utility companies serving the
                Property to the extent transferred to Seller on the utility
                company's records, or, at Seller's option, Seller shall be
                entitled to receive and retain such refundable cash and
                deposits;

                        (ii)    Any taxes paid at or prior to Closing shall be
                prorated based upon the amounts actually paid. If taxes and
                assessments due and payable during the year of Closing have not
                been paid before Closing, Seller shall be charged at Closing an
                amount equal to that portion of such taxes and assessments which
                relates to the period before Closing and Purchaser shall pay the
                taxes and assessments prior to their becoming delinquent and on
                or prior to the date that will maximize any discounts or
                reductions in said taxes and assessments on account of early
                payment thereof. Any such apportionment made with respect to a
                tax year

<PAGE>

                for which the tax rate or assessed valuation, or both, have not
                yet been fixed shall be based upon the tax rate and/or assessed
                valuation last fixed. To the extent that the actual taxes and
                assessments for the current year differ from the amount
                apportioned at Closing, the parties shall make all necessary
                adjustments by appropriate payments between themselves within
                thirty (30) days after such amounts are determined following
                Closing, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4(e) hereof;

                        (iii)   Non-delinquent charges referred to in Section
                4.4(b) hereof which are payable by any tenant to a third party
                shall not be apportioned hereunder, and Purchaser shall accept
                title subject to any of such charges unpaid and Purchaser shall
                look solely to the tenant responsible therefor for the payment
                of the same. If Seller shall have paid any of such charges on
                behalf of any tenant, and shall not have been reimbursed
                therefor by the time of Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the
                reimbursement due Seller upon receipt of the same from the
                tenant(s) who are responsible for payment;

                        (iv)    As to utility charges referred to in Section
                4.4(a)(iii) hereof, Seller may on notice to Purchaser elect to
                pay one or more of all of said items accrued to the date
                hereinabove fixed for apportionment directly to the person or
                entity entitled thereto, and to the extent Seller so elects,
                such item shall not be apportioned hereunder, and Seller's
                obligation to pay such item directly in such case shall survive
                the Closing or any termination of this Agreement;

                        (v)     Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment
                of (A) all Tenant Inducement Costs (as hereinafter defined) and
                Commissions (as hereinafter defined) which become due and
                payable (whether before or after Closing) as a result of any new
                Leases, or any renewals, amendments or expansions of existing
                Leases, signed during the Lease Approval Period (as hereinafter
                defined) or as a result of any options exercised by tenants or
                the failure by a tenant to exercise any options during the Lease
                Approval Period, including, without limitation, the Commissions
                and Tenant Inducement Costs set forth on SCHEDULE 1, and, if
                required, approved or deemed approved in accordance with Section
                5.6 hereof; and (B) all Tenant Inducement Costs and Commissions
                as a result of new leases, or renewals, amendments or expansions
                of existing Leases, signed or entered into from and after the
                Closing Date or as a result of any options exercised by tenants
                or the failure by a tenant to exercise any options after the
                Closing Date. If, as of the Closing Date, Seller shall have paid
                any Tenant Inducement Costs or Commissions for which Purchaser
                is responsible pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Purchaser
                shall reimburse Seller therefor at Closing. As used herein (a)
                "COMMISSIONS" shall mean all brokerage commissions, finder's
                fees or other similar compensation due or payable in connection
                with the applicable lease and (b) "TENANT INDUCEMENT COSTS"
                shall mean any out-of-pocket payments required under a Lease to
                be paid by the landlord thereunder to or for the benefit of the
                tenant thereunder which is in the nature of a tenant inducement,

<PAGE>

                including specifically, without limitation, tenant improvement
                costs, lease buyout costs, and moving, design, refurbishment and
                club membership allowances. The term "Tenant Inducement Costs"
                shall not include loss of income resulting from any free rental
                period, it being agreed that Seller shall bear the loss
                resulting from any free rental period until the Closing Date and
                that Purchaser shall bear such loss from and after the Closing
                Date. For purposes hereof, the term "LEASE APPROVAL PERIOD"
                shall mean the period from the Effective Date until the Closing
                Date;

                        (vi)    As used herein, the term "REIMBURSABLE TENANT
                EXPENSES" shall mean payments required to be paid by tenants
                under Leases for such tenant's share of ad valorem taxes,
                insurance, common area maintenance and/or other operating
                expenses of the Property. Promptly after December 31, 2004,
                Purchaser shall determine the actual amount of Reimbursable
                Tenant Expenses for the year in which the Closing occurs.
                Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to collect from the
                tenants of the Property any underpayment of Reimbursable Tenant
                Expenses for the year in which the Closing occurs and to pay to
                Seller Seller's share of said underpayment promptly upon
                collection thereof. Likewise any overpayments shall similarly be
                adjusted and Seller shall refund Purchaser its prorata share of
                such overpayments to the extent such overpayments have not
                previously been refunded to tenants or credited to Purchaser at
                Closing;

                        (vii)   Unpaid and delinquent Rent collected by Seller
                and Purchaser after the Closing Date shall be delivered as
                follows: (a) if Seller collects any unpaid or delinquent Rent
                for the Property, Seller shall, within fifteen (15) days after
                the receipt thereof, deliver to Purchaser any such Rent which
                Purchaser is entitled to hereunder relating to the Closing Date
                and any period thereafter, and (b) if Purchaser collects any
                unpaid or delinquent Rent from the Property, Purchaser shall,
                within fifteen (15) days after the receipt thereof, deliver to
                Seller any such Rent which Seller is entitled to hereunder
                relating to the period prior to the Closing Date. Seller and
                Purchaser agree that (i) all Rent received by Seller or
                Purchaser within the first ninety (90) day period after the
                Closing Date shall be applied first to reasonable costs of
                collection, then to current Rent, and then to delinquent Rent,
                if any, in the inverse order of their maturity. Purchaser will
                make a good faith effort after Closing to collect all Rents in
                the usual course of Purchaser's operation of the Property, but
                Purchaser will not be obligated to institute any lawsuit or
                other collection procedures to collect delinquent Rents. Seller
                may attempt to collect any delinquent Rents owed Seller and may
                institute any lawsuit or collection procedures, but may not
                evict any tenant. In the event that there shall be any Rents or
                other charges under any Leases which, although relating to a
                period prior to Closing, do not become due and payable until
                after Closing or are paid prior to Closing but are subject to
                adjustment after Closing (such as Reimbursable Tenant Expenses),
                then any Rents or charges of such type received by Purchaser or
                its agents or Seller or its agents subsequent to Closing shall,
                to the extent applicable to a period extending through the
                Closing, be

<PAGE>

                prorated between Seller and Purchaser as of Closing, with each
                party promptly remitting to the other amounts due as a result of
                such proration.

                        (viii)  Notwithstanding the terms of Section 4.4(c)(vii)
                above, if the tenant under any GSA Lease (defined below) or any
                Lease with any state or municipal governmental entity shall at
                Closing owe any Rent for the period prior to Closing, Seller and
                Purchaser agree that all Rent received by Seller or Purchaser
                after the Closing Date shall be applied first to Rent payable
                under the applicable Lease in the order of its maturity, and
                then to current Rent.

                (d)     For a period of three (3) years after the Closing and
        upon reasonable advance written notice, Purchaser shall allow Seller and
        its agents and representatives access without charge to all files,
        records and documents delivered to Purchaser at the Closing, upon
        reasonable advance notice and at all reasonable times, to examine and,
        at Seller's expense make copies of any and all such files, records and
        documents, which right shall survive the Closing;

                (e)     Except as otherwise provided herein, any revenue or
        expense amount which cannot be ascertained with certainty as of Closing
        shall be prorated on the basis of the parties' reasonable estimates of
        such amount, and shall be the subject of a final proration thirty (30)
        days after Closing, or as soon thereafter as the precise amounts can be
        ascertained; but in no event shall any reproration under this Agreement,
        other than with respect to taxes and assessments pursuant to Section
        4.4(b)(ii) above and Reimbursable Tenant Expenses pursuant to Section
        4.4(b)(vi) above, occur more than 180 days after the Closing. Purchaser
        shall promptly notify Seller when it becomes aware that any such
        estimated amount has been ascertained. Once all revenue and expense
        amounts have been ascertained, Purchaser shall prepare, and certify as
        correct, a final proration statement which shall be subject to Seller's
        approval. Upon Seller's acceptance and approval of any final proration
        statement submitted by Purchaser, such statement shall be conclusively
        deemed to be accurate and final.

                (f)     Subject to Section 4.4(e) hereof, the provisions of this
        Section 4.4 shall survive Closing.

        4.5     TRANSACTION TAXES AND CLOSING COSTS.

                (a)     Seller and Purchaser shall execute such returns,
        questionnaires and other documents as shall be required with regard to
        all applicable real property transaction taxes imposed by applicable
        federal, state or local law or ordinance;

                (b)     Seller shall pay the fees of any counsel representing

        following costs and expenses: (i) one-half (1/2) escrow fee, if any,
        which may be charged by the Escrow Agent or Title Company; (ii) one-half
        (1/2) of transfer tax, sales tax, documentary tax or similar tax which
        becomes payable by reason of the transfer of the Property, (iii) the
        cost of paying off Seller's existing financing and obtaining applicable

        not limited to payment of any prepayment premium or defeasance costs;
        and (iv) the cost of the Updated Survey.

                (c)     Purchaser shall pay the fees of any counsel representing
        Purchaser in connection with this transaction. Purchaser shall also pay
        the following costs and expenses: (i) one half (1/2) of the escrow fee,
        if any, which may be charged by the Escrow Agent or Title Companies;
        (ii) the premium for the Title Policy to be issued to Purchaser by the
        Title Company at Closing, including any endorsements to the Title
        Policy; (iii) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

        security deposits in connection with the ownership or operation of the

        transfer tax, sales tax, documentary stamp tax or similar tax which
        becomes payable by reason of the transfer of the Property, and (vi) all
        costs and expenses associated with Purchaser's financing.

                (d)     The Personal Property is included in this sale without
        charge, and Seller shall pay the amount of any and all sales or similar
        taxes payable in connection with the transfer of the Personal Property.
        Purchaser and Seller shall execute and deliver any tax returns required
        in connection therewith;

                (e)     All costs and expenses incident to this transaction and
        the closing thereof, and not specifically described above, shall be paid
        by the party incurring same; and

                (f)     The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall survive the
        Closing.

        4.6     CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION OF PURCHASER. The obligation
of Purchaser to consummate the transaction hereunder shall be subject to the
fulfillment on or before the Closing Date of all of the following conditions,
any or all of which may be waived by Purchaser in its sole discretion:

                (a)     Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser all of the

        of the Closing Date and, at Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
        certificate to that effect (the "SELLER REPRESENTATION CERTIFICATE").
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Seller Representation
        Certificate discloses the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (as
        defined in Section 4.6(g) hereof), the condition set forth in this
        Section 4.6(b) shall be deemed to be satisfied;

                (c)     Seller shall have performed and observed in all material
        respects all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be performed
        and observed by Seller as of the Closing Date;

<PAGE>

                (d)     The Property shall be conveyed at Closing subject only
        to the following matters, which are hereinafter referred to as the
        "PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS":

                        (i)     those matters that either are not objected to in
                writing within the time periods provided in Sections 2.2 or 2.3
                hereof, or if objected to in writing by Purchaser, are those
                which Seller has elected not to remove or cure, or has been
                unable to remove or cure, and subject to which Purchaser has
                elected or is deemed to have elected to accept the conveyance of
                the Property;

                        (ii)    the rights of tenants under the Leases;

                        (iii)   the lien of all ad valorem real estate taxes and
                assessments not yet due and payable as of the Closing Date (as
                defined in Section 4.1), subject to adjustment as herein
                provided;

                        (iv)    local, state and federal laws, ordinances or
                governmental regulations, including but not limited to, building
                and zoning laws, ordinances and regulations, now or hereafter in
                effect relating to the Property; and

                        (v)     matters that have arisen as a result of acts=
                done or suffered by or through Purchaser.

company of its Owner's Policy of Title Insurance (the "TITLE POLICY") covering
the Real Property, in the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price, subject only
to the Permitted Exceptions.

                (e)     No later than five (5) days prior to Closing, Purchaser
        shall have received, from tenants leasing eighty percent (80%) or more
        of the leased area of the Building which is occupied as of the Effective
        Date (specifically including, in any event, all tenants who lease more
        than 20,000 rentable square feet in the Building) Estoppel Certificates
        addressed to Purchaser and any other person designated by Purchaser,
        dated not earlier than October 15, 2004, substantially in the form of
        EXHIBIT D or with respect to any Lease where the tenant is the United
        States of America (each a "GSA LEASE"), a completed GSA standard form
        Lease Status Report (a "GSA FORM") rather than an estoppel certificate
        in the form of EXHIBIT D.. Purchaser agrees that an Estoppel Certificate
        shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Section 4.6(e) even
        though it may not be in the form or substance of EXHIBIT D or a GSA
        Form, provided that the Estoppel Certificate (i) states that no material
        defaults have occurred under the lease and confirms the economic terms
        of the lease, or (ii) contains the specific information (as opposed to a
        general or "catch all" requirement), if any, required by the applicable
        lease, or (iii) does not depart from the form of Estoppel Certificate
        attached as EXHIBIT D or the GSA Form other than to reflect facts or
        circumstances that are disclosed in writing by Seller or that were known
        to Purchaser through its inspection of the Property prior to the
        expiration of the Inspection Period.

<PAGE>

                (f)     No event(s) shall have occurred or condition arisen,
        after the Effective Date with respect to the Property (other than any
        loss or damage to the Property caused by fire or other casualty or
        condemnation which shall be governed by the terms of Article VII
        hereof), the result(s) of which may reasonably be expected to have an
        adverse effect on the value of the Property (in the aggregate) which
        would in the reasonable opinion of an investment sales broker reasonably
        selected by Purchaser and Seller be equal to or greater than Five
        Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) (a "MATERIAL ADVERSE
        EFFECT").

        If any of the conditions to Purchaser's obligations under Section 4.6
shall fail to occur and such failure is not otherwise a default under this
Agreement (in which event Purchaser would be afforded the rights under Section
6.2 hereof), then Purchaser may, as long as Purchaser is not in default
hereunder, and as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate this Agreement by
written notice to Seller, in which event the Deposit shall be promptly returned
to Purchaser and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations
hereunder (except for those obligations of either party that expressly survive
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the other provisions of this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any condition to
Purchaser's obligations hereunder described in this Section 4.6 shall not have
been satisfied, Seller may elect by notice to Purchaser to extend the Closing
for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days in order to satisfy such condition.

        4.7     CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION OF SELLER. The obligation of
Seller to consummate the transaction hereunder shall be subject to the
fulfillment on or before the Closing Date of all of the following conditions,
any or all of which may be waived by Seller in its sole discretion:

                (a)     Seller shall have received the Purchase Price as
        adjusted as provided herein, pursuant to and payable in the manner
        provided for in this Agreement;

                (b)     Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller all of the
        items required to be delivered to Seller pursuant to the terms of this
        Agreement, including but not limited to, those provided for in Section
        4.3 hereof;

                (c)     All of the representations and warranties of Purchaser
        contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
        respects as of the Closing Date (with appropriate modifications
        permitted under this Agreement); and

                (d)     Purchaser shall have performed and observed in all
        material respects all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be
        performed and observed by Purchaser as of the Closing Date.

        4.8     EQUITY TRANSFER.

                (a)     Purchaser may, in lieu of having Seller execute and
        deliver to Purchaser the Deed, the Bill of Sale, the Assignment of
        Leases and the Assignment of Contracts, elect (an "EQUITY TRANSFER
        ELECTION") to receive an assignment of 100% of

<PAGE>

        the membership interests in Seller (an "EQUITY TRANSFER"). Purchaser may
        exercise an Equity Transfer Election, if at all, by giving a written
        notice to Seller no later than ten (10) business days prior to the
        Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
        Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 4.5 hereof), Purchaser
        shall pay any and all transfer taxes and similar taxes payable as a
        result of the Equity Transaction. From and after the date hereof, Seller
        shall, upon request of Purchaser, make available to Purchaser copies of
        all relevant operating agreements, organizational documents, tax returns
        and similar documents, to the extent in Seller's possession or control,
        in order to enable Purchaser to decide whether or not Purchaser desires
        to exercise its Equity Transfer Election. Furthermore, Seller and
        Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith the forms of the documents and
        terms and conditions of the Equity Transfer, all of which shall be
        subject to the approval of Purchaser and Seller. The failure of
        Purchaser and Seller to agree upon the terms and conditions of an Equity
        Transfer shall not, under any circumstances, constitute a default by
        Purchaser or Seller hereunder or otherwise give rise to the right of
        Purchaser or Seller to terminate this Agreement. If the parties agree
        upon the terms of an Equity Transfer, each party shall, upon the request
        of either party, execute an amendment to this Agreement confirming the
        terms of such Equity Transfer.

                (b)     Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser may make
        an Equity Transfer Election and then subsequently convey interests in
        the Property to TIC Investors (as hereinafter defined). In such event,
        provided that the requirements set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of
        Section 1.3 are fulfilled as of Closing, the Purchase Price payable by
        Purchaser at Closing shall be Fifty-Two Million Six Hundred Thousand and
        No/100 Dollars ($52,600,000.00). If Purchaser thereafter conveys
        interests in the Property to TIC Investors within ninety (90) days after
        the Closing, then (a) Seller shall remain responsible, pursuant to
        Section 4.5, to pay one-half (1/2) of the transfer tax, sales tax,
        documentary tax or similar tax which becomes payable by reason of the
        transfer to the TIC Investors, but Seller shall receive a credit against
        such obligation in the amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100
        Dollars ($150,000.00). Any amount payable by Seller pursuant to this
        Section 4.8(b) shall be paid by Seller within ten (10) days after
        written notice from Purchaser, and, in any event, shall be based on the
        transfer price to the TIC Investors not to exceed $52,750,000.00.

                                   ARTICLE V

                    REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

        5.1     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER. Seller hereby makes
the following representations and warranties to Purchaser as of the Effective
Date, which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made
again as of the Closing, subject to Section 4.2(f) hereof:

                (a)     ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY. Seller has been duly
        organized and is validly existing under the laws of the State of
        Delaware. Seller has the full right and authority to enter into this
        Agreement and to transfer all of the Property and

<PAGE>

        to consummate or cause to be consummated the transaction contemplated by
        this Agreement. The person signing this Agreement on behalf of Seller is
        authorized to do so.

                (b)     OPERATING AGREEMENTS. The Operating Agreements listed on
        EXHIBIT C are all of the agreements concerning the operation and
        maintenance of the Property entered into by or on behalf of Seller and
        affecting the Property and Seller has no knowledge of any other
        Operating Agreements that would be binding on Purchaser or the Property
        after Closing, except those operating agreements that are to be
        terminated by Seller within thirty (30) days after the Closing, and
        except any agreement with Seller's property manager, which shall be
        terminated by Seller as of the Closing Date.

                (c)     LEASE BROKERAGE. There are no agreements with brokers
        providing for the payment by Seller or to, Seller's knowledge, Seller's
        predecessors-in-interest under the Leases, of Commissions or fees for
        procuring tenants with respect to any lease in effect on the date hereof
        (the "EXISTING LEASES"), except as disclosed in EXHIBIT K hereto; and to
        Seller's knowledge, no commission, fee or other compensation is payable
        (or will, with the passage of time or occurrence of any event or both,
        be payable), with respect to the current term of the Existing Leases
        except as disclosed in EXHIBIT K. Seller has not agreed in writing to
        pay and, to Seller's knowledge, there are no Commissions, fees or other
        compensation payable in respect of the exercise of renewal, extension or
        expansion options set forth in the Existing Leases except as disclosed
        in EXHIBIT K.

                (d)     CONDEMNATION. Seller has neither received written notice
        of any pending or threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceedings
        relating to or affecting the Property and Seller has no knowledge of the
        same.

                (e)     LITIGATION. To Seller's knowledge, except as set forth
        on EXHIBIT L attached hereto, there is no litigation which has been
        filed or threatened against Seller that arises out of the ownership or
        operation of the Property;

                (f)     VIOLATIONS. To Seller's knowledge, except as set forth
        on EXHIBIT M attached hereto, Seller has not received notice of any
        uncured violation of any Legal Requirements relating to the use or
        operation of the Property which would materially adversely affect the
        Property or use thereof; and

                (g)     LEASES. The list of Existing Leases attached hereto as
        EXHIBIT N is accurate in all material respects. There are no Leases or
        other tenancies for any space in the Real Property other than those set
        forth on EXHIBIT N. Except as otherwise disclosed on EXHIBIT O or
        elsewhere in this Agreement; Seller has not received from any tenant
        under a Lease a written notice of default by Seller as landlord under
        such Lease or a written notice of violation of any Legal Requirements,
        and to Seller's knowledge, Seller is not in default as landlord under
        any of the Leases which would give rise to the right of termination of
        any Lease in favor of a tenant. Except as set forth on EXHIBIT O, Seller
        has not sent any tenant under a Lease a written notice of default by the
        tenant under such Lease, and to Seller's knowledge, no tenant is in
        default under any of

<PAGE>

        the Leases, which would give rise to the right of termination of any
        lease in favor of the landlord under the Leases if such default is not
        cured within any applicable grace, notice or cure period.

        5.2     KNOWLEDGE DEFINED. References to the "knowledge" of Seller shall
refer only to the current actual knowledge of the Designated Employees (as
hereinafter defined) of Seller, and shall not be construed, by imputation or
otherwise, to refer to the knowledge of Seller or any affiliate of Seller, to
any property manager, or to any other officer, agent, manager, representative or
employee of Seller or any affiliate thereof or to impose upon such Designated
Employees any duty to investigate the matter to which such actual knowledge, or
the absence thereof, pertains. As used herein, the term "DESIGNATED EMPLOYEES"
shall refer to Evan Boris and Mario Silva. Furthermore, Seller's representations
and warranties shall be deemed to be modified to reflect any facts or
circumstances disclosed in the Tenant Estoppels received by Purchaser.

        5.3     LEGAL REQUIREMENTS DEFINED. References to "Legal Requirements"
shall mean all laws, statutes, codes, acts, ordinances, orders, judgments,
decrees, injunctions, rules, regulations, Permits, licenses, authorizations,
directions and requirements of governmental authorities or quasi-governmental
authorities, which now or at any time hereafter exercise jurisdiction over the
Property, or any use, operation or condition of the Property.

        5.4     INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

        5.5     SURVIVAL OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND OTHER
OBLIGATIONS. The representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section
5.1 hereof as updated as of the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, shall survive Closing for a period of two hundred seventy (270) days
after Closing. No claim for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of Seller under this Agreement or any other instrument delivered to
Purchaser under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be actionable or payable if
the breach in question results from or is based on a condition, state of facts
or other matter which was known to Purchaser prior to Closing (including,
without limitation, pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(f) above or if the
truth of any matter is confirmed in any Tenant Estoppel or other estoppel
certificate received by Purchaser from a third party). Seller shall have no
liability to Purchaser for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement (a) unless the valid claims for all such breaches collectively
aggregate more than Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) in which
event the full amount of such valid claims shall be actionable up to, but not in
excess of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($2,500,000.00)
(the "CAP") absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and (b) unless
written notice containing a description of the specific nature of such breach
shall have been given by Purchaser to Seller prior to the expiration of and an
action shall have been commenced by Purchaser against Seller within sixty (60)
days after expiration of such two hundred seventy (270) day period. Purchaser
agrees to first seek recovery under any insurance policies, service contracts,
Tenant Estoppels and Leases prior to seeking recovery from Seller, and Seller
shall not be liable to Purchaser if Purchaser's claim is satisfied from such
insurance policies, service contracts or Leases. In no event shall Seller be
liable for any consequential or punitive damages or for any damages in excess of
the Cap.

<PAGE>

        5.6     COVENANTS OF SELLER. Seller hereby covenants with Purchaser as
follows:

                (a)     From the Effective Date hereof until the Closing or
        earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller shall use reasonable
        efforts to operate and maintain the Property in a manner generally
        consistent with the manner in which Seller has operated and maintained
        the Property prior to the date hereof;

                (b)     Except as provided in this Section 5.6(b), a copy of any
        amendment, renewal or expansion of an existing Lease or of any new Lease
        which Seller in good faith wishes to execute between the Effective Date
        and the Closing Date will be submitted to Purchaser prior to execution
        by Seller. While this Agreement is in effect, Seller shall not enter
        into any new Lease or amend any existing Lease without the approval of
        Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
        conditioned. Purchaser agrees to notify Seller in writing within five
        (5) business days after its receipt thereof of either its approval or
        disapproval thereof, including all Tenant Inducement Costs and
        Commissions to be incurred in connection therewith. Prior to the
        expiration of the Inspection Period, in the event Purchaser informs
        Seller within such five business day period that Purchaser does not
        approve the amendment, renewal or expansion of the existing Lease or the
        new Lease, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Seller
        shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice
        thereof to Purchaser within five (5) business days after Seller's
        receipt of written notice of Purchaser's disapproval thereof. If this
        Agreement is terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
        paragraph, then neither party shall have any further rights or
        obligations hereunder (except for any obligations of either party which
        expressly survive the termination of this Agreement), the Deposit shall
        be returned to Purchaser and each party shall bear its own costs
        incurred hereunder. In the event Purchaser fails to notify Seller in
        writing of its approval or disapproval within the five (5) business day
        period set forth above, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved such
        new Lease, amendment, renewal or expansion. At Closing, Purchaser shall
        reimburse Seller for any Tenant Inducement Costs, Commissions or other
        expenses, including legal fees, incurred by Seller pursuant to an
        amendment, a renewal, an expansion or a new Lease approved (or deemed
        approved) by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
        have no right to approve any amendment to an Existing Lease entered into
        by Seller which evidences the exercise by a Tenant of a right or option
        granted to such Tenant in its Lease.

                (c)     Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly if Seller becomes
        aware of any transaction or occurrence prior to the Closing Date which
        would affect the truth or accuracy of any representation or warranty of
        Seller contained in Section 5.1 hereof in a manner that would have a
        Material Adverse Effect and which Seller does not, in its reasonable
        opinion, believe can be cured prior to the Closing Date.

        5.7     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER. Purchaser hereby
makes the following representations and warranties to Seller as of the Effective

<PAGE>

Date, which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made
again as of the Closing, subject to Section 4.3(c) hereof:

                (a)     ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY. Purchaser has been duly
        organized and is validly existing under the laws of Texas. Purchaser has
        the full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
        consummate or cause to be consummated the transaction contemplated by
        this Agreement. The person signing this Agreement on behalf of Purchaser
        is authorized to do so; and

                (b)     PENDING ACTIONS. To Purchaser's knowledge, there is no
        action, suit, arbitration, unsatisfied order or judgment, government
        investigation or proceeding pending against Purchaser.

        5.8     SURVIVAL OF PURCHASER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.5 hereof as
updated as of the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
shall survive Closing for a period of one (1) year. Purchaser shall have no
liability to Seller for a breach of any representation or warranty unless
written notice containing a description of the specific nature of such breach
shall have been given by Seller to Purchaser prior to the expiration of said one
(1) year and an action shall have been commenced by Seller against Purchaser
within sixty (60) days after such one (1) year period.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                     DEFAULT

        6.1     DEFAULT BY PURCHASER. In the event Purchaser fails to close the
purchase of the Property when legally required to do so, Seller shall be
entitled, as its sole remedy, to terminate this Agreement and receive the
Deposit as liquidated damages for the breach of this Agreement, it being agreed
between the parties hereto that the actual damages to Seller in the event of
such breach are impractical to ascertain and the amount of the Deposit is a
reasonable estimate thereof.

        6.2     DEFAULT BY SELLER. In the event Seller fails to close the sale
of the Property when legally required to do so, Purchaser shall be entitled, as
its sole remedy, either (a) to receive the return of the Deposit, which return
shall operate to terminate this Agreement and release Seller and from any and
all liability hereunder, or (b) to enforce specific performance of Seller's
obligations to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Purchaser expressly waives its rights to seek damages in the event of Seller's
default hereunder. Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this
Agreement and receive back the Deposit if Purchaser fails to file suit for
specific performance against Seller in a court having jurisdiction in the county
and state in which the Property is located, on or before sixty (60) days
following the date upon which Closing was to have occurred. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the remedy of specific performance is not legally available to
Purchaser solely due to Seller's transfer of the Property to a third person who
is not controlled by Seller or its Affiliates and who is not subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be entitled to the

<PAGE>

prompt return of the Deposit and to seek an action for actual damages against
Seller as a result of such material default by Seller under this Agreement.

        6.3     RECOVERABLE DAMAGES. Notwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2
hereof, in no event shall the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2 limit the
damages recoverable by either party against the other party due to the other
party's obligation to indemnify such party in accordance with this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                  RISK OF LOSS

        7.1     MINOR DAMAGE. In the event of loss or damage to the Property or
any portion thereof which is not "Major" (as hereinafter defined), this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect provided that Seller shall, at
Seller's option, either (a) perform any necessary repairs, or (b) assign to
Purchaser all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to any claims and
proceeds Seller may have with respect to any casualty insurance policies or
condemnation awards relating to the premises in question. In the event that
Seller elects to perform repairs upon the Property, Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to complete such repairs promptly and the Closing Date shall be extended
a reasonable time in order to allow for the completion of such repairs. If
Seller elects to assign a casualty claim to Purchaser, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the lesser of the deductible amount under
Seller's insurance policy and the cost to complete the repairs. Upon Closing,
full risk of loss with respect to the Property shall pass to Purchaser.

        7.2     MAJOR DAMAGE. In the event of a "Major" loss or damage, either
Seller or Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other
party, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser. If neither
Seller nor Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement within ten (10) days
after Seller sends Purchaser written notice of the occurrence of such Major loss
or damage or threatened Major loss or damage in the case of condemnation or
eminent domain proceedings (which notice shall state the cost of repair or
restoration thereof as opined by an architect in accordance with Section 7.3
hereof), then Seller and Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to proceed
with Closing, in which event Seller shall, at Seller's option, either (a)
perform any necessary repairs, or (b) assign to Purchaser all of Seller's right,
title and interest in and to any claims and proceeds Seller may have with
respect to any casualty insurance policies or condemnation awards and the
proceeds of any rent loss insurance relating to the premises in question. In the
event that Seller elects to perform repairs upon the Property, Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to complete such repairs promptly and the Closing Date shall
be extended a reasonable time in order to allow for the completion of such
repairs. If Seller elects to assign a casualty claim to Purchaser, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the deductible amount under
Seller's insurance policy. Upon Closing, full risk of loss with respect to the
Property shall pass to Purchaser.

        7.3     DEFINITION OF "MAJOR" LOSS OR DAMAGE. For purposes of Sections
7.1 and 7.2, "MAJOR" loss or damage refers to the following: (a) loss or damage
to the Property hereof such that the cost of repairing or restoring the premises
in question to substantially the

<PAGE>

same condition which existed prior to the event of damage, in the opinion of an
architect selected by Seller and reasonably approved by Purchaser, either (i)
would be equal to or greater than Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100
Dollars ($750,000.00), or (ii) could not reasonably be repaired or restored
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of casualty, (b) any loss
due to a condemnation or threatened condemnation which could or will permanently
and materially impair the current and intended use of the Property, or (c) any
loss, damage, condemnation or threat of condemnation which gives rise to a right
of termination of a lease in favor of any tenant unless waived in writing by
such tenant or which gives rise to abatement of rent not covered by rent loss
insurance that will inure to Purchaser's benefit after Closing. If Purchaser
does not give written notice to Seller of Purchaser's reasons for disapproving
an architect within five (5) business days after receipt of notice of the
proposed architect, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved the architect
selected by Seller.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   COMMISSIONS

        8.1     BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. With respect to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller represents that it has not engaged any
broker in connection with this transaction except for Eastdil Realty Company,
LLC, whose commissions will be paid by Seller and Purchaser represents that it
has not engaged any broker in connection with this transaction. Each party
hereto agrees that if any person or entity makes a claim for brokerage
commissions or finder's fees related to the sale of the Property by Seller to
Purchaser, and such claim is made by, through or on account of any acts or
alleged acts of said party or its representatives, said party will protect,
indemnify, defend and hold the other party free and harmless from and against
any and all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) in connection therewith. The provisions of this paragraph shall
survive Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                             DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS

        9.1     NO RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS. Except as expressly stated herein or
in the documents to be executed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser in
connection with the Closing, Seller makes no representation or warranty as to
the truth, accuracy or completeness of any materials, data or information
delivered by Seller or its brokers or agents to Purchaser in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all
materials, data and information delivered by Seller to Purchaser in connection
with the transaction contemplated hereby are provided to Purchaser as a
convenience only and that any reliance on or use of such materials, data or
information by Purchaser shall be at the sole risk of Purchaser, except as
otherwise expressly stated herein. Neither Seller, nor any affiliate of Seller,
nor the person or entity which prepared any report or reports delivered by

        10.1    CONFIDENTIALITY. Purchaser and its representatives shall hold in
strictest confidence all data and information obtained with respect to Seller or
its business, whether obtained before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and shall not disclose the same to others; provided, however,
that it is understood and agreed that Purchaser may disclose such data and

or its agents or representatives of this Section 10.1, Seller shall be entitled

party hereto is bound, each such party is (and any employee, representative or
other agent of such party is) hereby expressly authorized to disclose the "tax
treatment" or "tax structure" (as those terms are defined in Treas. Reg.
ss.ss.1.6011-4(c)(8) and (9), respectively) of the transactions the subject of
this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions or other

        10.3    ASSIGNMENT. Subject to the provisions of this Section 10.3, the

exercised by written notice to Seller delivered at any time prior to Closing and
subject to the Assignment Procedures, to assign its rights under this Agreement
to an Affiliate of Purchaser. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
Purchaser may not assign its rights under this Agreement without first obtaining
Seller's written approval, which approval may be granted or withheld in Seller's
sole discretion. In the event Purchaser intends to assign its rights hereunder
the following shall apply (the "ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES"): (a) Purchaser and the
proposed assignee shall execute an assignment and assumption of this Agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, and (b) in no event
shall any assignment of this Agreement release or discharge Purchaser from any
liability or obligation hereunder. "AFFILIATE" shall mean, with respect to any
specified entity, an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with such specified entity, with control meaning the power through the
ownership of voting securities by contract or otherwise to direct the management
and policies of such entity. It is expressly agreed that any partnership in
which the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser is the general partner and
any fund sponsored by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall be deemed to
be an Affiliate of Purchaser. The provisions of this Section 10.3 shall survive
the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

        10.5    MODIFICATIONS. This Agreement cannot be changed orally, and no
executory agreement shall be effective to waive, change, modify or discharge it
in whole or in part unless such executory agreement is in writing and is signed

discharge is sought.

        10.6    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, including the exhibits and
schedules hereto, contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and fully supersedes all prior written
or oral agreements and understandings between the parties pertaining to such

        10.7    FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party agrees that it will execute and
deliver such other documents and take such other action, whether prior or
subsequent to Closing, as may be reasonably requested by the other party to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement so long as the same
imposes no additional liability on such party. The provisions of this Section
10.7 shall survive Closing.

<PAGE>

        10.8    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all such executed counterparts shall constitute the same agreement, and the
signature of any party to any counterpart shall be deemed a signature to, and
may be appended to, any other counterpart.

        10.9    FACSIMILE SIGNATURES. In order to expedite the transaction
contemplated herein, telecopied or facsimile signatures may be used in place of
original signatures on this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser intend to be bound
by the signatures on the telecopied document, are aware that the other party
will rely on the telecopied signatures, and hereby waive any defenses to the
enforcement of the terms of this Agreement based on the form of signature.

        10.10   SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect;
provided that the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision does not

        10.11   APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State in which the Property is

Closing.

        10.13   CAPTIONS. The section headings appearing in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only and are not intended, to any extent and for
any purpose, to limit or define the text of any section or any subsection
hereof.

        10.15   RECORDATION. This Agreement may not be recorded by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. The
provisions of this Section 10.15 shall survive the Closing or any termination of

        10.16   LIKE KIND EXCHANGE.

                (a)     Seller, at its option, may elect to use the proceeds for
        the sale of the Property to purchase a replacement property as part of a
        like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. If Seller desires to
        sell the Property as part of such a like-kind exchange, Seller shall
        notify Purchaser no later than two (2) business days prior to the

<PAGE>

        Closing Date. Provided Seller has so notified Purchaser, Purchaser
        agrees to cooperate with Seller to effect the like-kind exchange
        contemplated hereunder and to execute and deliver all documents which
        reasonably may be required to effectuate such exchange as a qualified
        transaction pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code; provided that: (i) the
        Closing shall not be delayed; (ii) Purchaser incurs no additional cost
        or liability in connection with the like-kind exchange; (iii) Seller
        pays all costs associated with the like-kind exchange; and (iv)
        Purchaser is not obligated to take title to any other property.
        Similarly, in the event that Purchaser elects to purchase the Property
        as part of a like kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code
        (including, without limitation, a Section 1031 exchange involving
        tenancy in common interests), Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser
        in connection therewith and to execute and deliver all documents which
        reasonably may be required to effectuate such exchange as a qualified
        transaction pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code; provided that: (i) the
        Closing shall not be delayed; (ii) Seller incurs no additional cost or
        liability in connection with the like-kind exchange; (iii) Purchaser
        pays all costs associated with the like-kind exchange; and (iv) Seller
        is not obligated to take title to any other property.

                (b)     Purchaser has advised Seller that Purchaser may solicit
        investments in the Property from investors that will acquire undivided
        interests in the Property and become tenants-in-common therein ("TIC
        INVESTORS"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
        contrary, Seller and Purchaser agree as follows: (a) Purchaser shall
        have the right to distribute information about the Property and this
        Agreement to potential brokers and their advisors who may facilitate the
        sale of such tenant-in-common interests; (b) Purchaser shall have the
        right to assign its rights under this Agreement (including, without
        limitation, any rights arising under the Seller Representation
        Certificate) to TIC Investors that invest in the Property; (c) Purchaser
        shall have the right to modify the form of Tenant Estoppel Certificate
        attached hereto as EXHIBIT D so as to expressly include the TIC
        Investors that invest in the Property within the definition of
        "Purchaser," so long as Purchaser informs Seller of such modification at
        least three (3) business days prior to the expiration of the Inspection
        Period; and (d) with the prior approval of Seller, which approval shall
        not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Purchaser may
        undertake other activities to accommodate the sale of tenant in common
        interest and substitute TIC Investors for all or portion of the
        Purchaser's interests hereunder or in the Property.

        10.17   ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS. In the event suit or action is
instituted to interpret or enforce the terms of this Agreement, or in connection
with any arbitration or mediation of any dispute, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover from the other party such sum as the court, arbitrator or
mediator may adjudge reasonable as such party's costs and attorney's fees,
including such costs and fees as are incurred in any trial, on any appeal, in
any bankruptcy proceeding (including the adjudication of issues peculiar to
bankruptcy law) and in any petition for review. Each party shall also have the
right to recover its reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in collecting
any sum or debt owed to it by the other party, with or without litigation, if
such sum or debt is not paid within fifteen (15) days following written demand
therefor.

<PAGE>

        10.18   GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed as authorizing Purchaser to apply for a zoning change,
variance, subdivision maps, lot line adjustment, or other discretionary
governmental act, approval or permit with respect to the Property prior to the
Closing, and Purchaser agrees not to do so. Purchaser agrees not to submit any
reports, studies or other documents, including, without limitation, plans and
specifications, impact statements for water, sewage, drainage or traffic,
environmental review forms, or energy conservation checklists to any
governmental agency, or any amendment or modification to any such instruments or
documents prior to the Closing except to the extent disclosure is required by
applicable law. Purchaser's obligation to purchase the Property shall not be
subject to or conditioned upon Purchaser's obtaining any variances, zoning
amendments, subdivision maps, lot line adjustment or other discretionary
governmental act, approval or permit.

        10.19   EXCLUSIVE. Until this Agreement is terminated, Seller will cease
its marketing efforts and will not solicit, negotiate or enter into any backup
letters of intent, proposals, options or contracts with regard to the purchase
and sale of the Property.

        10.20   CALCULATION OF TIME PERIODS. In the event the date on which
Purchaser or Seller is required to take any action under the terms of this
Agreement is not a business day, the action will be taken on the next succeeding
business day.

        10.21   TIME OF ESSENCE. Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and
agree that time is strictly of the essence with respect to each and every term,
condition, obligation and provision hereof.
