the Property for the amount of Fifty-Two Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
and No/100 Dollars ($52,750,000.00) (the "PURCHASE PRICE"); provided, however,
if (a) Purchaser exercises the Equity Transfer Election (as defined in Section
4.8), (b) the parties agree upon the terms of an Equity Transfer, as defined in
and contemplated by Section 4.8 hereof, (c) the parties close the transaction as
an Equity Transaction and (d) if as a result thereof, there is no transfer tax
or similar tax payable in connection with the transaction contemplated in this
Agreement, then the Purchase Price shall be Fifty-Two Million Six Hundred
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($52,600,000.00).

        1.4     PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price, as increased or
decreased by prorations and adjustments as herein provided, shall be payable in
full at Closing in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser prior to the Closing.

        1.5     DEPOSIT. Within three (3) business days after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deposit with Partners Title Company
(the "ESCROW AGENT" or the "TITLE COMPANY"), having its office at 712 Main
Street, Suite 2000E, Houston, Texas 77002-3215 (Attention: Karen Highfield) the
sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,500,000.00) (the
"INITIAL DEPOSIT") in good funds, either by certified bank or cashier's check or
by federal wire transfer. Purchaser agrees that Three Hundred Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($300,000.00) of the Initial Deposit shall be non-refundable
except as otherwise provided herein. On or prior to September 9, 2004, Purchaser
shall deposit with Escrow Agent the sum of One Million and

<PAGE>

No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "FIRST ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT") in good funds,
either by certified bank or cashiers check or by federal wire transfer. On or
prior to October 11, 2004, Purchaser shall deposit with Escrow Agent the sum of
One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "SECOND ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT")
in good funds, either by certified bank or cashiers check or by federal wire
transfer. On or prior to November 9, 2004, Purchaser shall deposit with Escrow
Agent the sum of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "THIRD
ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT") in good funds, either by certified bank or cashiers check
or by federal wire transfer. The Initial Deposit, together with the First
Additional Deposit, the Second Additional Deposit and the Third Additional
Deposit, and all interest earned thereon is collectively called the "DEPOSIT").
The Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit in an interest-bearing account
reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. All interest on such sum shall be deemed income of
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all costs and
fees imposed on the Deposit account. The Deposit shall be delivered to Seller
and applied against the Purchase Price at Closing or otherwise distributed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The failure of Purchaser to timely
deliver any Deposit hereunder shall be a material default, and shall entitle
Seller, at Seller's sole option, to exercise the remedies provided in Section
6.1 hereof, including without limitation to receive the Initial Deposit as
liquidated damages. Prior to expiration of the Inspection Period, the escrow
established pursuant to the Agreement shall be deemed to be a "sole order"
escrow, and Escrow Agent shall disburse the Deposit to Purchaser upon Escrow
Agent's receipt of any notice of termination prior to expiration of the
Inspection Period, without liability to Seller and notwithstanding any objection
by Seller to such disbursement.

        1.6     ESCROW AGENT. Escrow Agent shall hold and dispose of the Deposit
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser agree that
the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are purely ministerial in nature and
shall be expressly limited to the safekeeping and disposition of the Deposit in
accordance with this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall incur no liability in
connection with the safekeeping or disposition of the Deposit for any reason
other than Escrow Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence. In the event
that Escrow Agent shall be in doubt as to its duties or obligations with regard
to the Deposit, or in the event that Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions from Purchaser and Seller with respect to the Deposit, Escrow Agent
shall not be required to disburse the Deposit and may, at its option, continue
to hold the Deposit until both Purchaser and Seller agree as to its disposition,
or until a final judgment is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
directing its disposition, or Escrow Agent may interplead the Deposit in
accordance with the laws of the state in which the Property is located.

        Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any interest on the Deposit
except as is actually earned, or for the loss of any interest resulting from the
withdrawal of the Deposit prior to the date interest is posted thereon.

        Escrow Agent shall execute this Agreement solely for the purpose of
being bound by the provisions of Sections 1.5 and 1.6 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                TITLE AND SURVEY

        2.1     TITLE REVIEW PERIOD. During the period beginning upon the
Effective Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (local time at the Property) on August
27, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "TITLE REVIEW PERIOD"), Purchaser shall
have the right to review (a) a current preliminary title report on the Real
Property prepared by the Title Company which title report shall be obtained by
Purchaser and provided to Seller within five (5) days after the Effective Date;
and (b) Seller's existing survey of the Real Property (the "SURVEY"), which
Seller has delivered to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date. Purchaser may
obtain an updated survey of the Real Property (the "UPDATED SURVEY"). Purchaser
shall provide a copy of any Updated Survey to Seller upon Purchaser's receipt of
same.

        2.2     TITLE EXAMINATION. Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing (the
"TITLE NOTICE") prior to the expiration of the Title Review Period which
exceptions to title (including survey matters), if any, will not be accepted by
Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to notify Seller in writing of its disapproval of
any exceptions to title by the expiration of the Title Review Period, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have approved the condition of title to the Real Property. If
Purchaser notifies Seller in writing that Purchaser objects to any exceptions to
title, Seller shall have three (3) days after receipt of the Title Notice to
notify Purchaser (a) that Seller will remove such objectionable exceptions from
title on or before the Closing; provided that Seller may extend the Closing for
such period as shall be required to effect such cure, but not beyond thirty (30)
days; or (b) that Seller elects not to cause such exceptions to be removed;
provided that Seller shall pay or discharge any monetary liens created, assumed
or consented to by Seller. The procurement by Seller of a commitment for the
issuance of the Title Policy (as defined in Section 4.6 hereof) or an
endorsement thereto insuring Purchaser against any title exception which was
disapproved pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be deemed a cure by Seller of
such disapproval subject to Purchaser's reasonable approval thereof. If Seller
gives Purchaser notice under clause (b) above, Purchaser shall have until the
expiration of the Title Review Period in which to notify Seller that Purchaser
will nevertheless proceed with the purchase and take title to the Property
subject to such exceptions, or that Purchaser will terminate this Agreement. If
Purchaser shall fail to notify Seller of its election on or before the
expiration of the Title Review Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected
to terminate this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated or deemed
terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then neither
party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder (except for those
obligations of either party that expressly survive the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement), Three Hundred
Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($300,000.00) of the Deposit shall be paid to Seller
and the balance of the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and each party
shall bear its own costs incurred hereunder.

        2.3     PRE-CLOSING "GAP" TITLE DEFECTS. Between the expiration of the
Title Review Period and prior to Closing, Purchaser may notify Seller in writing
(the "GAP NOTICE") of any objections to title (a) that did not exist prior to
the expiration of the Title Review Period and are not due to acts done or
suffered by or through Purchaser and (b) are raised by the Title Company between
the expiration of the Title Review Period and the Closing. provided that

<PAGE>

Purchaser must notify Seller of such objection to title within two (2) business
days of being made aware of the existence of such exception. If Purchaser sends
a Gap Notice to Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall have the same rights and
obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section
2.2 hereof, unless such new matter was created by Seller or with Seller's
consent, in which case, Seller shall satisfy Purchaser's objections relating
thereto at or prior to Closing.


                                  ARTICLE III

                               REVIEW OF PROPERTY


        3.1     RIGHT OF INSPECTION. During the period beginning upon the
Effective Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (local time at the Property) on September
8, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "INSPECTION PERIOD"), Purchaser shall
have the right to make a physical inspection of the Real Property, including an
inspection of the environmental condition thereof pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and to examine at the Property (or the property
manager's office) all documents and files concerning the leasing, maintenance
and operation of the Property, including expense budgets and accounting and tax
records to the extent related to the operation of the Property, but excluding
Seller's partnership or corporate records, internal memoranda, operating and
revenue budgets, accounting and tax records, appraisals, financial projections
and similar proprietary, confidential or privileged information (collectively,
the "CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS"). Purchaser has advised Seller that Purchaser must
cause to be prepared three (3) years of audited financial statements in respect
of the Property in accordance with the policies of Purchaser and certain laws
and regulations including, without limitation, Securities and Exchange
Commission Regulation S-X, 3-14. Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to
provide to Purchaser such financial statements and supporting documentation as
are necessary for Purchaser's auditors to prepare such audited financial
statements, provided such cooperation on the part of Seller shall impose no
liability on Seller.

        Purchaser understands and agrees that any on-site inspections of the
Property shall occur at reasonable times agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser
after reasonable prior written notice to Seller and shall be conducted so as not
to interfere unreasonably with the use of the Property by Seller or its tenants.
Seller reserves the right to have a representative present during any such
inspections. If Purchaser desires to do any invasive testing at the Property,
Purchaser shall do so only after notifying Seller and obtaining Seller's prior
written consent thereto, which consent may be subject to any terms and
conditions imposed by Seller in its sole discretion. Purchaser shall promptly
restore the Property to its condition prior to any such inspections or tests, at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense. At Seller's option, Purchaser will furnish to
Seller copies of any reports received by Purchaser relating to any inspections
of the Property. Purchaser agrees to protect, indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless from and against any claim for liabilities, losses, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), damages or injuries arising out of or
resulting from the inspection of the Property by Purchaser or its agents or
consultants (excluding discovery of condition), and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, such obligation to indemnify and hold harmless
Seller shall survive Closing or any

<PAGE>

termination of this Agreement. Unless legally required to report a condition
that is revealed by inspections, Purchaser shall not contact any governmental
authority without first obtaining the prior written consent of Seller thereto
and Seller, at Seller's election, shall be entitled to have a representative on
any telephone call or other contact made by Purchaser to a governmental
authority and to be present at any meeting between Purchaser and a governmental
authority. The foregoing shall not, however, prevent Purchaser from contacting
governmental authorities to request zoning and code compliance letters for
customary due diligence and shall not prohibit Purchaser from reviewing or
requesting copies of public files relating to the Property. Purchaser shall
maintain and shall assure that its contractors maintain public liability and
property damage insurance in amounts and in form and substance adequate to
insure against all liabilities of Purchaser and its agents, employees or
contractors arising out of any entry upon or inspection of the Property pursuant
to the provisions hereof and concurrently with the execution hereof, Purchaser
shall provide Seller with evidence of such insurance coverage naming Seller as
an additional insured party thereunder.

        3.2     REPORTS. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (1) PURCHASER HAS RECEIVED
COPIES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING AND OTHER REPORTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE
"REPORTS") LISTED ON EXHIBIT P ATTACHED HERETO, (2) IF SELLER DELIVERS ANY
ADDITIONAL REPORTS TO PURCHASER, PURCHASER WILL ACKNOWLEDGE IN WRITING THAT IT
HAS RECEIVED SUCH REPORTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT THEREOF, AND (3) ANY REPORTS
DELIVERED OR TO BE DELIVERED BY SELLER OR ITS AGENTS OR CONSULTANTS TO PURCHASER
ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE SOLELY AS AN ACCOMMODATION TO PURCHASER AND MAY NOT BE
RELIED UPON BY PURCHASER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY.
PURCHASER AGREES THAT SELLER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER
FOR ANY INACCURACY IN OR OMISSION FROM ANY REPORT. PURCHASER HAS CONDUCTED, OR
WILL CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE INSPECTION PERIOD, ITS OWN
INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY TO THE EXTENT PURCHASER DEEMS
SUCH AN INVESTIGATION TO BE NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE.

        3.3     RIGHT OF TERMINATION. If for any reason whatsoever Purchaser
determines that the Property or any aspect thereof is unsuitable for Purchaser's
acquisition, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, in its
sole discretion and for any reason or no reason by giving written notice thereof
to Seller prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, and if Purchaser
gives such notice of termination on or prior to the expiration of the Inspection
Period, this Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then Three Hundred Thousand and
No/100 Dollars of the Deposit shall be paid to Seller and the balance of the
Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and, thereupon, neither party shall have
any further rights or obligations hereunder (except for those obligations that
expressly survive the termination of this Agreement). If Purchaser fails to give
Seller a notice of termination prior to the expiration of the Initial Review
Period or the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved all
aspects of the Property (except title and survey, which shall be governed by
Article II hereof)

<PAGE>

and to have elected to proceed with the purchase of the Property pursuant to the
terms hereof, subject to all conditions to Closing otherwise specified herein.

        3.4     REVIEW OF TENANT ESTOPPELS. After October 15, 2004, Seller shall
deliver to each tenant of the Property an estoppel certificate in substantially
the form of EXHIBIT D attached hereto (each, an "ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE"), and
shall request that the tenants complete and sign the Estoppel Certificates and
return them to Seller. Seller shall deliver copies of the completed Estoppel
Certificates to Purchaser as Seller receives them.

        3.5     SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENTS. Seller
agrees to cooperate with Purchaser to obtain subordination, non-disturbance and
attornment agreements ("SNDAS") from tenants under Leases selected by
Purchaser's lender. As and when received by Seller, Seller shall deliver the
executed SNDAs to Purchaser. If the transaction contemplated herein fails to
close for any reason whatsoever, Purchaser shall return to Seller all such
executed SNDAs previously delivered to Purchaser. The failure to obtain SNDAs
from all or any of the selected tenants shall not constitute a default by Seller
hereunder or otherwise entitle Purchaser to terminate this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                     CLOSING

hereby (the "CLOSING") shall be held at the Chicago offices of Piper Rudnick LLP
on December 1, 2004 (the "CLOSING DATE"). At the Closing, Seller and Purchaser
shall perform the obligations set forth in, respectively, Section 4.2 and
Section 4.3 hereof, the performance of which obligations shall be concurrent

escrow administered by Escrow Agent. In such event, the Purchase Price and all
documents shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, as escrowee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, by delivering, at least three (3) business days prior to the
original Closing Date, to Seller a written notice ("EXTENSION NOTICE").

                (b)     deliver to Purchaser a duly executed bill of sale
        (collectively, the "BILL OF SALE") conveying the Personal Property

        modified due to changes since the Effective Date, deliver to Seller a
        certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and executed on behalf of
        Purchaser by a duly authorized representative thereof, identifying any
        such representation or warranty which is no longer true and correct and
        explaining the state of facts giving rise to the change. In no event
        shall Purchaser be liable to Seller for, or be deemed to be in default
        hereunder by reason of, any breach of representation or warranty set
        forth in Sections 5.7(a) or (b) hereof which results from any change
        that (i) occurs between the Effective Date and the Closing Date and (ii)
        is expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement or is beyond
        the reasonable control of Purchaser to prevent;

                (d)     deliver to Seller such evidence as the Title Company may
        reasonably require as to the authority of the person or persons
        executing documents on behalf of Purchaser;

                (e)     deliver such affidavits as may be customarily and
        reasonably required by the Title Company, in a form reasonably
        acceptable to Purchaser;

                (f)     execute a closing and proration statement; and

                (g)     deliver such additional documents as shall be reasonably
        required to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

        4.4     CREDITS AND PRORATIONS.

                (a)     Seller shall endeavor to provide Purchaser with a draft
        of the closing and proration statement referred to in Sections 4.2(l)
        and 4.3(l) (the "CLOSING STATEMENT") on or before the date that is five
        (5) business days prior to the Closing Date. If Seller fails to deliver
        such draft Closing Statement on or before such date, such failure

<PAGE>

        shall not constitute a default by Seller hereunder or otherwise entitle
        Purchaser to terminate this Agreement.

                (b)     All income and expenses of the Property shall be
        apportioned as of 12:01 a.m., on the Closing Date, as if Purchaser were
        vested with title to the Property during the entire day upon which
        Closing occurs. Such prorated items shall include without limitation the
        following:

                        (i)     all Rents;

                        (ii)    taxes and assessments (including personal
                property taxes on the Personal Property) levied against the
                Property;

                        (iii)   utility charges for which Seller is liable, if
                any, such charges to be apportioned at Closing on the basis of
                the most recent meter reading occurring prior to Closing (dated
                not more than fifteen (15) days prior to Closing) or, if
                unmetered, on the basis of a current bill for each such utility;

                        (iv)    all amounts payable under Operating Agreements;
                and

                        (v)     any other operating expenses or other items
                pertaining to the Property which are customarily prorated
                between a purchaser and a seller in the county in which the
                Property is located.

                (c)     In addition to and notwithstanding anything contained in
        Section 4.4(b) hereof:

                        (i)     At Closing, (A) Seller shall, at Seller's
                option, either deliver to Purchaser any Security Deposits
                provided under the Leases or credit to the account of Purchaser
                the amount of such Security Deposits (to the extent such
                Security Deposits have not been applied against delinquent Rents
                or otherwise as provided in the Leases, any amounts so supplied
                being disclosed to Purchaser in writing with a representation by
                Seller that the tenant who posted such applied Security Deposit
                is not entitled to a refund of the applied amount), and (B)
                Purchaser shall credit to the account of Seller all refundable
                cash or other deposits posted with utility companies serving the
                Property to the extent transferred to Seller on the utility
                company's records, or, at Seller's option, Seller shall be
                entitled to receive and retain such refundable cash and
                deposits;

                        (ii)    Any taxes paid at or prior to Closing shall be
                prorated based upon the amounts actually paid. If taxes and
                assessments due and payable during the year of Closing have not
                been paid before Closing, Seller shall be charged at Closing an
                amount equal to that portion of such taxes and assessments which
                relates to the period before Closing and Purchaser shall pay the
                taxes and assessments prior to their becoming delinquent and on
                or prior to the date that will maximize any discounts or
                reductions in said taxes and assessments on account of early
                payment thereof. Any such apportionment made with respect to a
                tax year

<PAGE>

                for which the tax rate or assessed valuation, or both, have not
                yet been fixed shall be based upon the tax rate and/or assessed
                valuation last fixed. To the extent that the actual taxes and
                assessments for the current year differ from the amount
                apportioned at Closing, the parties shall make all necessary
                adjustments by appropriate payments between themselves within
                thirty (30) days after such amounts are determined following
                Closing, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4(e) hereof;

                        (iii)   Non-delinquent charges referred to in Section
                4.4(b) hereof which are payable by any tenant to a third party
                shall not be apportioned hereunder, and Purchaser shall accept
                title subject to any of such charges unpaid and Purchaser shall
                look solely to the tenant responsible therefor for the payment
                of the same. If Seller shall have paid any of such charges on
                behalf of any tenant, and shall not have been reimbursed
                therefor by the time of Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the
                reimbursement due Seller upon receipt of the same from the
                tenant(s) who are responsible for payment;

                        (iv)    As to utility charges referred to in Section
                4.4(a)(iii) hereof, Seller may on notice to Purchaser elect to
                pay one or more of all of said items accrued to the date
                hereinabove fixed for apportionment directly to the person or
                entity entitled thereto, and to the extent Seller so elects,
                such item shall not be apportioned hereunder, and Seller's
                obligation to pay such item directly in such case shall survive
                the Closing or any termination of this Agreement;

                        (v)     Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment
                of (A) all Tenant Inducement Costs (as hereinafter defined) and
                Commissions (as hereinafter defined) which become due and
                payable (whether before or after Closing) as a result of any new
                Leases, or any renewals, amendments or expansions of existing
                Leases, signed during the Lease Approval Period (as hereinafter
                defined) or as a result of any options exercised by tenants or
                the failure by a tenant to exercise any options during the Lease
                Approval Period, including, without limitation, the Commissions
                and Tenant Inducement Costs set forth on SCHEDULE 1, and, if
                required, approved or deemed approved in accordance with Section
                5.6 hereof; and (B) all Tenant Inducement Costs and Commissions
                as a result of new leases, or renewals, amendments or expansions
                of existing Leases, signed or entered into from and after the
                Closing Date or as a result of any options exercised by tenants
                or the failure by a tenant to exercise any options after the
                Closing Date. If, as of the Closing Date, Seller shall have paid
                any Tenant Inducement Costs or Commissions for which Purchaser
                is responsible pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Purchaser
                shall reimburse Seller therefor at Closing. As used herein (a)
                "COMMISSIONS" shall mean all brokerage commissions, finder's
                fees or other similar compensation due or payable in connection
                with the applicable lease and (b) "TENANT INDUCEMENT COSTS"
                shall mean any out-of-pocket payments required under a Lease to
                be paid by the landlord thereunder to or for the benefit of the
                tenant thereunder which is in the nature of a tenant inducement,

<PAGE>

                including specifically, without limitation, tenant improvement
                costs, lease buyout costs, and moving, design, refurbishment and
                club membership allowances. The term "Tenant Inducement Costs"
                shall not include loss of income resulting from any free rental
                period, it being agreed that Seller shall bear the loss
                resulting from any free rental period until the Closing Date and
                that Purchaser shall bear such loss from and after the Closing
                Date. For purposes hereof, the term "LEASE APPROVAL PERIOD"
                shall mean the period from the Effective Date until the Closing
                Date;

                        (vi)    As used herein, the term "REIMBURSABLE TENANT
                EXPENSES" shall mean payments required to be paid by tenants
                under Leases for such tenant's share of ad valorem taxes,
                insurance, common area maintenance and/or other operating
                expenses of the Property. Promptly after December 31, 2004,
                Purchaser shall determine the actual amount of Reimbursable
                Tenant Expenses for the year in which the Closing occurs.
                Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to collect from the
                tenants of the Property any underpayment of Reimbursable Tenant
                Expenses for the year in which the Closing occurs and to pay to
                Seller Seller's share of said underpayment promptly upon
                collection thereof. Likewise any overpayments shall similarly be
                adjusted and Seller shall refund Purchaser its prorata share of
                such overpayments to the extent such overpayments have not
                previously been refunded to tenants or credited to Purchaser at
                Closing;

                        (vii)   Unpaid and delinquent Rent collected by Seller
                and Purchaser after the Closing Date shall be delivered as
                follows: (a) if Seller collects any unpaid or delinquent Rent
                for the Property, Seller shall, within fifteen (15) days after
                the receipt thereof, deliver to Purchaser any such Rent which
                Purchaser is entitled to hereunder relating to the Closing Date
                and any period thereafter, and (b) if Purchaser collects any
                unpaid or delinquent Rent from the Property, Purchaser shall,
                within fifteen (15) days after the receipt thereof, deliver to
                Seller any such Rent which Seller is entitled to hereunder
                relating to the period prior to the Closing Date. Seller and
                Purchaser agree that (i) all Rent received by Seller or
                Purchaser within the first ninety (90) day period after the
                Closing Date shall be applied first to reasonable costs of
                collection, then to current Rent, and then to delinquent Rent,
                if any, in the inverse order of their maturity. Purchaser will
                make a good faith effort after Closing to collect all Rents in
                the usual course of Purchaser's operation of the Property, but
                Purchaser will not be obligated to institute any lawsuit or
                other collection procedures to collect delinquent Rents. Seller
                may attempt to collect any delinquent Rents owed Seller and may
                institute any lawsuit or collection procedures, but may not
                evict any tenant. In the event that there shall be any Rents or
                other charges under any Leases which, although relating to a
                period prior to Closing, do not become due and payable until
                after Closing or are paid prior to Closing but are subject to
                adjustment after Closing (such as Reimbursable Tenant Expenses),
                then any Rents or charges of such type received by Purchaser or
                its agents or Seller or its agents subsequent to Closing shall,
                to the extent applicable to a period extending through the
                Closing, be

<PAGE>

                prorated between Seller and Purchaser as of Closing, with each
                party promptly remitting to the other amounts due as a result of
                such proration.

                        (viii)  Notwithstanding the terms of Section 4.4(c)(vii)
                above, if the tenant under any GSA Lease (defined below) or any
                Lease with any state or municipal governmental entity shall at
                Closing owe any Rent for the period prior to Closing, Seller and
                Purchaser agree that all Rent received by Seller or Purchaser
                after the Closing Date shall be applied first to Rent payable
                under the applicable Lease in the order of its maturity, and
                then to current Rent.

                (d)     For a period of three (3) years after the Closing and
        upon reasonable advance written notice, Purchaser shall allow Seller and
        its agents and representatives access without charge to all files,
        records and documents delivered to Purchaser at the Closing, upon
        reasonable advance notice and at all reasonable times, to examine and,
        at Seller's expense make copies of any and all such files, records and
        documents, which right shall survive the Closing;

                (e)     Except as otherwise provided herein, any revenue or
        expense amount which cannot be ascertained with certainty as of Closing
        shall be prorated on the basis of the parties' reasonable estimates of
        such amount, and shall be the subject of a final proration thirty (30)
        days after Closing, or as soon thereafter as the precise amounts can be
        ascertained; but in no event shall any reproration under this Agreement,
        other than with respect to taxes and assessments pursuant to Section
        4.4(b)(ii) above and Reimbursable Tenant Expenses pursuant to Section
        4.4(b)(vi) above, occur more than 180 days after the Closing. Purchaser
        shall promptly notify Seller when it becomes aware that any such
        estimated amount has been ascertained. Once all revenue and expense
        amounts have been ascertained, Purchaser shall prepare, and certify as
        correct, a final proration statement which shall be subject to Seller's
        approval. Upon Seller's acceptance and approval of any final proration
        statement submitted by Purchaser, such statement shall be conclusively
        deemed to be accurate and final.

                (f)     Subject to Section 4.4(e) hereof, the provisions of this
        Section 4.4 shall survive Closing.

        4.5     TRANSACTION TAXES AND CLOSING COSTS.

                (a)     Seller and Purchaser shall execute such returns,
        questionnaires and other documents as shall be required with regard to
        all applicable real property transaction taxes imposed by applicable
        federal, state or local law or ordinance;

                (b)     Seller shall pay the fees of any counsel representing

        which may be charged by the Escrow Agent or Title Company; (ii) one-half

        if any, which may be charged by the Escrow Agent or Title Companies;

        becomes payable by reason of the transfer of the Property, and (vi) all
        costs and expenses associated with Purchaser's financing.

                (d)     The Personal Property is included in this sale without
        charge, and Seller shall pay the amount of any and all sales or similar
        taxes payable in connection with the transfer of the Personal Property.
        Purchaser and Seller shall execute and deliver any tax returns required
        in connection therewith;

                (e)     All costs and expenses incident to this transaction and
        the closing thereof, and not specifically described above, shall be paid
        by the party incurring same; and

                (f)     The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall survive the
        Closing.

        4.6     CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION OF PURCHASER. The obligation

        Certificate discloses the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (as

                hereof, or if objected to in writing by Purchaser, are those

                        (v)     matters that have arisen as a result of acts=
                done or suffered by or through Purchaser.

        Evidence of delivery of title subject only to the Permitted Exceptions
shall be the issuance by the Title Company, and/or another national title
company of its Owner's Policy of Title Insurance (the "TITLE POLICY") covering
the Real Property, in the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price, subject only
to the Permitted Exceptions.

                (e)     No later than five (5) days prior to Closing, Purchaser
        shall have received, from tenants leasing eighty percent (80%) or more
        of the leased area of the Building which is occupied as of the Effective
        Date (specifically including, in any event, all tenants who lease more
        than 20,000 rentable square feet in the Building) Estoppel Certificates
        addressed to Purchaser and any other person designated by Purchaser,
        dated not earlier than October 15, 2004, substantially in the form of
        EXHIBIT D or with respect to any Lease where the tenant is the United
        States of America (each a "GSA LEASE"), a completed GSA standard form
        Lease Status Report (a "GSA FORM") rather than an estoppel certificate
        in the form of EXHIBIT D.. Purchaser agrees that an Estoppel Certificate
        shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Section 4.6(e) even
        though it may not be in the form or substance of EXHIBIT D or a GSA
        Form, provided that the Estoppel Certificate (i) states that no material
        defaults have occurred under the lease and confirms the economic terms
        of the lease, or (ii) contains the specific information (as opposed to a
        general or "catch all" requirement), if any, required by the applicable
        lease, or (iii) does not depart from the form of Estoppel Certificate
        attached as EXHIBIT D or the GSA Form other than to reflect facts or
        circumstances that are disclosed in writing by Seller or that were known
        to Purchaser through its inspection of the Property prior to the
        expiration of the Inspection Period.

<PAGE>

                (f)     No event(s) shall have occurred or condition arisen,
        after the Effective Date with respect to the Property (other than any
        loss or damage to the Property caused by fire or other casualty or
        condemnation which shall be governed by the terms of Article VII
        hereof), the result(s) of which may reasonably be expected to have an
        adverse effect on the value of the Property (in the aggregate) which
        would in the reasonable opinion of an investment sales broker reasonably
        selected by Purchaser and Seller be equal to or greater than Five
        Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) (a "MATERIAL ADVERSE
        EFFECT").

        If any of the conditions to Purchaser's obligations under Section 4.6
shall fail to occur and such failure is not otherwise a default under this
Agreement (in which event Purchaser would be afforded the rights under Section
6.2 hereof), then Purchaser may, as long as Purchaser is not in default
hereunder, and as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate this Agreement by
written notice to Seller, in which event the Deposit shall be promptly returned
to Purchaser and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations
hereunder (except for those obligations of either party that expressly survive
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the other provisions of this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any condition to
Purchaser's obligations hereunder described in this Section 4.6 shall not have
been satisfied, Seller may elect by notice to Purchaser to extend the Closing
for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days in order to satisfy such condition.

        4.7     CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION OF SELLER. The obligation of
Seller to consummate the transaction hereunder shall be subject to the
fulfillment on or before the Closing Date of all of the following conditions,
any or all of which may be waived by Seller in its sole discretion:

                (a)     Seller shall have received the Purchase Price as
        adjusted as provided herein, pursuant to and payable in the manner
        provided for in this Agreement;

                (b)     Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller all of the
        items required to be delivered to Seller pursuant to the terms of this
        Agreement, including but not limited to, those provided for in Section
        4.3 hereof;

                (c)     All of the representations and warranties of Purchaser
        contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
        respects as of the Closing Date (with appropriate modifications
        permitted under this Agreement); and

                (d)     Purchaser shall have performed and observed in all
        material respects all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be
        performed and observed by Purchaser as of the Closing Date.

        4.8     EQUITY TRANSFER.

                (a)     Purchaser may, in lieu of having Seller execute and
        deliver to Purchaser the Deed, the Bill of Sale, the Assignment of
        Leases and the Assignment of Contracts, elect (an "EQUITY TRANSFER
        ELECTION") to receive an assignment of 100% of

<PAGE>

        the membership interests in Seller (an "EQUITY TRANSFER"). Purchaser may
        exercise an Equity Transfer Election, if at all, by giving a written
        notice to Seller no later than ten (10) business days prior to the
        Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
        Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 4.5 hereof), Purchaser
        shall pay any and all transfer taxes and similar taxes payable as a
        result of the Equity Transaction. From and after the date hereof, Seller
        shall, upon request of Purchaser, make available to Purchaser copies of
        all relevant operating agreements, organizational documents, tax returns
        and similar documents, to the extent in Seller's possession or control,
        in order to enable Purchaser to decide whether or not Purchaser desires
        to exercise its Equity Transfer Election. Furthermore, Seller and
        Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith the forms of the documents and
        terms and conditions of the Equity Transfer, all of which shall be
        subject to the approval of Purchaser and Seller. The failure of
        Purchaser and Seller to agree upon the terms and conditions of an Equity
        Transfer shall not, under any circumstances, constitute a default by
        Purchaser or Seller hereunder or otherwise give rise to the right of
        Purchaser or Seller to terminate this Agreement. If the parties agree
        upon the terms of an Equity Transfer, each party shall, upon the request
        of either party, execute an amendment to this Agreement confirming the
        terms of such Equity Transfer.

                (b)     Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser may make
        an Equity Transfer Election and then subsequently convey interests in
        the Property to TIC Investors (as hereinafter defined). In such event,
        provided that the requirements set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of
        Section 1.3 are fulfilled as of Closing, the Purchase Price payable by
        Purchaser at Closing shall be Fifty-Two Million Six Hundred Thousand and
        No/100 Dollars ($52,600,000.00). If Purchaser thereafter conveys
        interests in the Property to TIC Investors within ninety (90) days after
        the Closing, then (a) Seller shall remain responsible, pursuant to
        Section 4.5, to pay one-half (1/2) of the transfer tax, sales tax,
        documentary tax or similar tax which becomes payable by reason of the
        transfer to the TIC Investors, but Seller shall receive a credit against
        such obligation in the amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100
        Dollars ($150,000.00). Any amount payable by Seller pursuant to this
        Section 4.8(b) shall be paid by Seller within ten (10) days after
        written notice from Purchaser, and, in any event, shall be based on the
        transfer price to the TIC Investors not to exceed $52,750,000.00.

                                   ARTICLE V

                    REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

        5.1     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER. Seller hereby makes
the following representations and warranties to Purchaser as of the Effective
Date, which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made
again as of the Closing, subject to Section 4.2(f) hereof:

                (a)     ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY. Seller has been duly
        organized and is validly existing under the laws of the State of
        Delaware. Seller has the full right and authority to enter into this
        Agreement and to transfer all of the Property and

<PAGE>

        to consummate or cause to be consummated the transaction contemplated by
        this Agreement. The person signing this Agreement on behalf of Seller is
        authorized to do so.

                (b)     OPERATING AGREEMENTS. The Operating Agreements listed on
        EXHIBIT C are all of the agreements concerning the operation and
        maintenance of the Property entered into by or on behalf of Seller and
        affecting the Property and Seller has no knowledge of any other
        Operating Agreements that would be binding on Purchaser or the Property
        after Closing, except those operating agreements that are to be
        terminated by Seller within thirty (30) days after the Closing, and
        except any agreement with Seller's property manager, which shall be
        terminated by Seller as of the Closing Date.

                (c)     LEASE BROKERAGE. There are no agreements with brokers
        providing for the payment by Seller or to, Seller's knowledge, Seller's
        predecessors-in-interest under the Leases, of Commissions or fees for
        procuring tenants with respect to any lease in effect on the date hereof
        (the "EXISTING LEASES"), except as disclosed in EXHIBIT K hereto; and to
        Seller's knowledge, no commission, fee or other compensation is payable
        (or will, with the passage of time or occurrence of any event or both,
        be payable), with respect to the current term of the Existing Leases
        except as disclosed in EXHIBIT K. Seller has not agreed in writing to
        pay and, to Seller's knowledge, there are no Commissions, fees or other
        compensation payable in respect of the exercise of renewal, extension or
        expansion options set forth in the Existing Leases except as disclosed
        in EXHIBIT K.

                (d)     CONDEMNATION. Seller has neither received written notice
        of any pending or threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceedings
        relating to or affecting the Property and Seller has no knowledge of the
        same.

                (e)     LITIGATION. To Seller's knowledge, except as set forth
        on EXHIBIT L attached hereto, there is no litigation which has been
        filed or threatened against Seller that arises out of the ownership or
        operation of the Property;

                (f)     VIOLATIONS. To Seller's knowledge, except as set forth
        on EXHIBIT M attached hereto, Seller has not received notice of any
        uncured violation of any Legal Requirements relating to the use or
        operation of the Property which would materially adversely affect the
        Property or use thereof; and

                (g)     LEASES. The list of Existing Leases attached hereto as
        EXHIBIT N is accurate in all material respects. There are no Leases or
        other tenancies for any space in the Real Property other than those set
        forth on EXHIBIT N. Except as otherwise disclosed on EXHIBIT O or
        elsewhere in this Agreement; Seller has not received from any tenant
        under a Lease a written notice of default by Seller as landlord under
        such Lease or a written notice of violation of any Legal Requirements,
        and to Seller's knowledge, Seller is not in default as landlord under
        any of the Leases which would give rise to the right of termination of
        any Lease in favor of a tenant. Except as set forth on EXHIBIT O, Seller
        has not sent any tenant under a Lease a written notice of default by the
        tenant under such Lease, and to Seller's knowledge, no tenant is in
        default under any of

<PAGE>

        the Leases, which would give rise to the right of termination of any
        lease in favor of the landlord under the Leases if such default is not
        cured within any applicable grace, notice or cure period.

        5.2     KNOWLEDGE DEFINED. References to the "knowledge" of Seller shall
refer only to the current actual knowledge of the Designated Employees (as
hereinafter defined) of Seller, and shall not be construed, by imputation or
otherwise, to refer to the knowledge of Seller or any affiliate of Seller, to
any property manager, or to any other officer, agent, manager, representative or
employee of Seller or any affiliate thereof or to impose upon such Designated
Employees any duty to investigate the matter to which such actual knowledge, or
the absence thereof, pertains. As used herein, the term "DESIGNATED EMPLOYEES"
shall refer to Evan Boris and Mario Silva. Furthermore, Seller's representations
and warranties shall be deemed to be modified to reflect any facts or
circumstances disclosed in the Tenant Estoppels received by Purchaser.

        5.3     LEGAL REQUIREMENTS DEFINED. References to "Legal Requirements"
shall mean all laws, statutes, codes, acts, ordinances, orders, judgments,
decrees, injunctions, rules, regulations, Permits, licenses, authorizations,
directions and requirements of governmental authorities or quasi-governmental
authorities, which now or at any time hereafter exercise jurisdiction over the
Property, or any use, operation or condition of the Property.

        5.4     INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

        5.5     SURVIVAL OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND OTHER
OBLIGATIONS. The representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section
5.1 hereof as updated as of the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, shall survive Closing for a period of two hundred seventy (270) days
after Closing. No claim for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of Seller under this Agreement or any other instrument delivered to
Purchaser under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be actionable or payable if
the breach in question results from or is based on a condition, state of facts
or other matter which was known to Purchaser prior to Closing (including,
without limitation, pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(f) above or if the
truth of any matter is confirmed in any Tenant Estoppel or other estoppel
certificate received by Purchaser from a third party). Seller shall have no
liability to Purchaser for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement (a) unless the valid claims for all such breaches collectively
aggregate more than Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) in which
event the full amount of such valid claims shall be actionable up to, but not in
excess of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($2,500,000.00)
(the "CAP") absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and (b) unless
written notice containing a description of the specific nature of such breach
shall have been given by Purchaser to Seller prior to the expiration of and an
action shall have been commenced by Purchaser against Seller within sixty (60)
days after expiration of such two hundred seventy (270) day period. Purchaser
agrees to first seek recovery under any insurance policies, service contracts,
Tenant Estoppels and Leases prior to seeking recovery from Seller, and Seller
shall not be liable to Purchaser if Purchaser's claim is satisfied from such
insurance policies, service contracts or Leases. In no event shall Seller be
liable for any consequential or punitive damages or for any damages in excess of
the Cap.

<PAGE>

        5.6     COVENANTS OF SELLER. Seller hereby covenants with Purchaser as
follows:

                (a)     From the Effective Date hereof until the Closing or
        earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller shall use reasonable
        efforts to operate and maintain the Property in a manner generally
        consistent with the manner in which Seller has operated and maintained
        the Property prior to the date hereof;

                (b)     Except as provided in this Section 5.6(b), a copy of any
        amendment, renewal or expansion of an existing Lease or of any new Lease
        which Seller in good faith wishes to execute between the Effective Date
        and the Closing Date will be submitted to Purchaser prior to execution
        by Seller. While this Agreement is in effect, Seller shall not enter
        into any new Lease or amend any existing Lease without the approval of
        Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
        conditioned. Purchaser agrees to notify Seller in writing within five
        (5) business days after its receipt thereof of either its approval or
        disapproval thereof, including all Tenant Inducement Costs and
        Commissions to be incurred in connection therewith. Prior to the
        expiration of the Inspection Period, in the event Purchaser informs
        Seller within such five business day period that Purchaser does not
        approve the amendment, renewal or expansion of the existing Lease or the
        new Lease, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Seller
        shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice
        thereof to Purchaser within five (5) business days after Seller's
        receipt of written notice of Purchaser's disapproval thereof. If this
        Agreement is terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
        paragraph, then neither party shall have any further rights or
        obligations hereunder (except for any obligations of either party which
        expressly survive the termination of this Agreement), the Deposit shall
        be returned to Purchaser and each party shall bear its own costs
        incurred hereunder. In the event Purchaser fails to notify Seller in
        writing of its approval or disapproval within the five (5) business day
        period set forth above, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved such
        new Lease, amendment, renewal or expansion. At Closing, Purchaser shall
        reimburse Seller for any Tenant Inducement Costs, Commissions or other
        expenses, including legal fees, incurred by Seller pursuant to an
        amendment, a renewal, an expansion or a new Lease approved (or deemed
        approved) by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
        have no right to approve any amendment to an Existing Lease entered into
        by Seller which evidences the exercise by a Tenant of a right or option
        granted to such Tenant in its Lease.

                (c)     Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly if Seller becomes
        aware of any transaction or occurrence prior to the Closing Date which
        would affect the truth or accuracy of any representation or warranty of
        Seller contained in Section 5.1 hereof in a manner that would have a
        Material Adverse Effect and which Seller does not, in its reasonable
        opinion, believe can be cured prior to the Closing Date.

        5.7     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER. Purchaser hereby
makes the following representations and warranties to Seller as of the Effective

<PAGE>

Date, which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made
again as of the Closing, subject to Section 4.3(c) hereof:

                (a)     ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY. Purchaser has been duly
        organized and is validly existing under the laws of Texas. Purchaser has
        the full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
        consummate or cause to be consummated the transaction contemplated by
        this Agreement. The person signing this Agreement on behalf of Purchaser
        is authorized to do so; and

                (b)     PENDING ACTIONS. To Purchaser's knowledge, there is no
        action, suit, arbitration, unsatisfied order or judgment, government
        investigation or proceeding pending against Purchaser.

        5.8     SURVIVAL OF PURCHASER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.5 hereof as
updated as of the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
shall survive Closing for a period of one (1) year. Purchaser shall have no
liability to Seller for a breach of any representation or warranty unless
written notice containing a description of the specific nature of such breach
shall have been given by Seller to Purchaser prior to the expiration of said one
(1) year and an action shall have been commenced by Seller against Purchaser
within sixty (60) days after such one (1) year period.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                     DEFAULT

        6.1     DEFAULT BY PURCHASER. In the event Purchaser fails to close the
purchase of the Property when legally required to do so, Seller shall be
entitled, as its sole remedy, to terminate this Agreement and receive the
Deposit as liquidated damages for the breach of this Agreement, it being agreed
between the parties hereto that the actual damages to Seller in the event of
such breach are impractical to ascertain and the amount of the Deposit is a
reasonable estimate thereof.

        6.2     DEFAULT BY SELLER. In the event Seller fails to close the sale
of the Property when legally required to do so, Purchaser shall be entitled, as
its sole remedy, either (a) to receive the return of the Deposit, which return
shall operate to terminate this Agreement and release Seller and from any and
all liability hereunder, or (b) to enforce specific performance of Seller's
obligations to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Purchaser expressly waives its rights to seek damages in the event of Seller's
default hereunder. Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this
Agreement and receive back the Deposit if Purchaser fails to file suit for
specific performance against Seller in a court having jurisdiction in the county
and state in which the Property is located, on or before sixty (60) days
following the date upon which Closing was to have occurred. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the remedy of specific performance is not legally available to
Purchaser solely due to Seller's transfer of the Property to a third person who
is not controlled by Seller or its Affiliates and who is not subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be entitled to the

<PAGE>

prompt return of the Deposit and to seek an action for actual damages against
Seller as a result of such material default by Seller under this Agreement.

        6.3     RECOVERABLE DAMAGES. Notwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2
hereof, in no event shall the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2 limit the
damages recoverable by either party against the other party due to the other
party's obligation to indemnify such party in accordance with this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                  RISK OF LOSS

        7.1     MINOR DAMAGE. In the event of loss or damage to the Property or
any portion thereof which is not "Major" (as hereinafter defined), this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect provided that Seller shall, at
Seller's option, either (a) perform any necessary repairs, or (b) assign to
Purchaser all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to any claims and
proceeds Seller may have with respect to any casualty insurance policies or
condemnation awards relating to the premises in question. In the event that
Seller elects to perform repairs upon the Property, Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to complete such repairs promptly and the Closing Date shall be extended
a reasonable time in order to allow for the completion of such repairs. If
Seller elects to assign a casualty claim to Purchaser, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the lesser of the deductible amount under
Seller's insurance policy and the cost to complete the repairs. Upon Closing,
full risk of loss with respect to the Property shall pass to Purchaser.

        7.2     MAJOR DAMAGE. In the event of a "Major" loss or damage, either
Seller or Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other
party, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser. If neither
Seller nor Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement within ten (10) days
after Seller sends Purchaser written notice of the occurrence of such Major loss
or damage or threatened Major loss or damage in the case of condemnation or
eminent domain proceedings (which notice shall state the cost of repair or
restoration thereof as opined by an architect in accordance with Section 7.3
hereof), then Seller and Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to proceed
with Closing, in which event Seller shall, at Seller's option, either (a)
perform any necessary repairs, or (b) assign to Purchaser all of Seller's right,
title and interest in and to any claims and proceeds Seller may have with
respect to any casualty insurance policies or condemnation awards and the
proceeds of any rent loss insurance relating to the premises in question. In the
event that Seller elects to perform repairs upon the Property, Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to complete such repairs promptly and the Closing Date shall
be extended a reasonable time in order to allow for the completion of such
repairs. If Seller elects to assign a casualty claim to Purchaser, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the deductible amount under
Seller's insurance policy. Upon Closing, full risk of loss with respect to the
Property shall pass to Purchaser.

        7.3     DEFINITION OF "MAJOR" LOSS OR DAMAGE. For purposes of Sections
7.1 and 7.2, "MAJOR" loss or damage refers to the following: (a) loss or damage
to the Property hereof such that the cost of repairing or restoring the premises
in question to substantially the

<PAGE>

same condition which existed prior to the event of damage, in the opinion of an
architect selected by Seller and reasonably approved by Purchaser, either (i)
would be equal to or greater than Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100
Dollars ($750,000.00), or (ii) could not reasonably be repaired or restored
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of casualty, (b) any loss
due to a condemnation or threatened condemnation which could or will permanently
and materially impair the current and intended use of the Property, or (c) any
loss, damage, condemnation or threat of condemnation which gives rise to a right
of termination of a lease in favor of any tenant unless waived in writing by
such tenant or which gives rise to abatement of rent not covered by rent loss
insurance that will inure to Purchaser's benefit after Closing. If Purchaser
does not give written notice to Seller of Purchaser's reasons for disapproving
an architect within five (5) business days after receipt of notice of the

strictest confidence all data and information obtained with respect to Seller or
its business, whether obtained before or after the execution and delivery of

or its agents or representatives of this Section 10.1, Seller shall be entitled

to the public of information with respect to the sale contemplated herein or any
matters set forth in this Agreement will be made only in the form approved by

party hereto is bound, each such party is (and any employee, representative or
other agent of such party is) hereby expressly authorized to disclose the "tax
treatment" or "tax structure" (as those terms are defined in Treas. Reg.
ss.ss.1.6011-4(c)(8) and (9), respectively) of the transactions the subject of
this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions or other

exercised by written notice to Seller delivered at any time prior to Closing and
subject to the Assignment Procedures, to assign its rights under this Agreement
to an Affiliate of Purchaser. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
Purchaser may not assign its rights under this Agreement without first obtaining
Seller's written approval, which approval may be granted or withheld in Seller's
sole discretion. In the event Purchaser intends to assign its rights hereunder
the following shall apply (the "ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES"): (a) Purchaser and the
proposed assignee shall execute an assignment and assumption of this Agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, and (b) in no event
shall any assignment of this Agreement release or discharge Purchaser from any
liability or obligation hereunder. "AFFILIATE" shall mean, with respect to any
specified entity, an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with such specified entity, with control meaning the power through the
ownership of voting securities by contract or otherwise to direct the management
and policies of such entity. It is expressly agreed that any partnership in
which the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser is the general partner and
any fund sponsored by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall be deemed to
be an Affiliate of Purchaser. The provisions of this Section 10.3 shall survive
the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

deliver such other documents and take such other action, whether prior or
subsequent to Closing, as may be reasonably requested by the other party to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement so long as the same
imposes no additional liability on such party. The provisions of this Section
10.7 shall survive Closing.

<PAGE>

        10.8    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all such executed counterparts shall constitute the same agreement, and the
signature of any party to any counterpart shall be deemed a signature to, and
may be appended to, any other counterpart.

        10.9    FACSIMILE SIGNATURES. In order to expedite the transaction
contemplated herein, telecopied or facsimile signatures may be used in place of
original signatures on this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser intend to be bound

will rely on the telecopied signatures, and hereby waive any defenses to the
enforcement of the terms of this Agreement based on the form of signature.

        10.10   SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect;
provided that the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision does not

        10.11   APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State in which the Property is

Closing.

        10.13   CAPTIONS. The section headings appearing in this Agreement are

        10.16   LIKE KIND EXCHANGE.

                (a)     Seller, at its option, may elect to use the proceeds for
        the sale of the Property to purchase a replacement property as part of a
        like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. If Seller desires to
        sell the Property as part of such a like-kind exchange, Seller shall
        notify Purchaser no later than two (2) business days prior to the

<PAGE>

        Closing Date. Provided Seller has so notified Purchaser, Purchaser
        agrees to cooperate with Seller to effect the like-kind exchange
        contemplated hereunder and to execute and deliver all documents which
        reasonably may be required to effectuate such exchange as a qualified
        transaction pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code; provided that: (i) the
        Closing shall not be delayed; (ii) Purchaser incurs no additional cost
        or liability in connection with the like-kind exchange; (iii) Seller
        pays all costs associated with the like-kind exchange; and (iv)
        Purchaser is not obligated to take title to any other property.
        Similarly, in the event that Purchaser elects to purchase the Property
        as part of a like kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code
        (including, without limitation, a Section 1031 exchange involving
        tenancy in common interests), Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser
        in connection therewith and to execute and deliver all documents which
        reasonably may be required to effectuate such exchange as a qualified
        transaction pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code; provided that: (i) the
        Closing shall not be delayed; (ii) Seller incurs no additional cost or
        liability in connection with the like-kind exchange; (iii) Purchaser
        pays all costs associated with the like-kind exchange; and (iv) Seller
        is not obligated to take title to any other property.

                (b)     Purchaser has advised Seller that Purchaser may solicit
        investments in the Property from investors that will acquire undivided
        interests in the Property and become tenants-in-common therein ("TIC
        INVESTORS"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
        contrary, Seller and Purchaser agree as follows: (a) Purchaser shall
        have the right to distribute information about the Property and this
        Agreement to potential brokers and their advisors who may facilitate the
        sale of such tenant-in-common interests; (b) Purchaser shall have the
        right to assign its rights under this Agreement (including, without
        limitation, any rights arising under the Seller Representation
        Certificate) to TIC Investors that invest in the Property; (c) Purchaser
        shall have the right to modify the form of Tenant Estoppel Certificate
        attached hereto as EXHIBIT D so as to expressly include the TIC
        Investors that invest in the Property within the definition of
        "Purchaser," so long as Purchaser informs Seller of such modification at
        least three (3) business days prior to the expiration of the Inspection
        Period; and (d) with the prior approval of Seller, which approval shall
        not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Purchaser may
        undertake other activities to accommodate the sale of tenant in common
        interest and substitute TIC Investors for all or portion of the
        Purchaser's interests hereunder or in the Property.

        10.17   ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS. In the event suit or action is
instituted to interpret or enforce the terms of this Agreement, or in connection
with any arbitration or mediation of any dispute, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover from the other party such sum as the court, arbitrator or
mediator may adjudge reasonable as such party's costs and attorney's fees,
including such costs and fees as are incurred in any trial, on any appeal, in
any bankruptcy proceeding (including the adjudication of issues peculiar to
bankruptcy law) and in any petition for review. Each party shall also have the
right to recover its reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in collecting
any sum or debt owed to it by the other party, with or without litigation, if
such sum or debt is not paid within fifteen (15) days following written demand
therefor.

<PAGE>

        10.18   GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed as authorizing Purchaser to apply for a zoning change,
variance, subdivision maps, lot line adjustment, or other discretionary
governmental act, approval or permit with respect to the Property prior to the
Closing, and Purchaser agrees not to do so. Purchaser agrees not to submit any
reports, studies or other documents, including, without limitation, plans and
specifications, impact statements for water, sewage, drainage or traffic,
environmental review forms, or energy conservation checklists to any
governmental agency, or any amendment or modification to any such instruments or
documents prior to the Closing except to the extent disclosure is required by
applicable law. Purchaser's obligation to purchase the Property shall not be
subject to or conditioned upon Purchaser's obtaining any variances, zoning
amendments, subdivision maps, lot line adjustment or other discretionary
governmental act, approval or permit.

        10.19   EXCLUSIVE. Until this Agreement is terminated, Seller will cease
its marketing efforts and will not solicit, negotiate or enter into any backup
letters of intent, proposals, options or contracts with regard to the purchase
and sale of the Property.

        10.20   CALCULATION OF TIME PERIODS. In the event the date on which
Purchaser or Seller is required to take any action under the terms of this
Agreement is not a business day, the action will be taken on the next succeeding
business day.

        10.21   TIME OF ESSENCE. Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and
agree that time is strictly of the essence with respect to each and every term,
condition, obligation and provision hereof.
