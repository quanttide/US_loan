         2. REGISTRATION.

                  (a) On or prior to the Filing Date the Company shall prepare
         and file with the Commission a Registration Statement covering the
         Registrable Securities for an offering to be made on a continuous basis
         pursuant to Rule 415. The Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3
         (except if the Company is not then eligible to register for resale the
         Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case such registration
         shall be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith). The
         Company shall cause the Registration Statement to become effective and
         remain effective as provided herein. The Company shall use its
         reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
         declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible
         after the filing thereof, but in any event no later than the
         Effectiveness Date. The Company shall use its reasonable commercial
         efforts to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective under
         the Securities Act until the date which is the earlier date of when (i)
         all Registrable Securities have been sold or (ii) all Registrable
         Securities may be sold immediately without registration under the
         Securities Act and without volume restrictions pursuant to Rule 144(k),
         as determined by the counsel to the Company pursuant to a written
         opinion letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable to the
         Company's transfer agent and the affected Holders (the "Effectiveness
         Period").

                  (b) If: (i) the Registration Statement is not filed on or
         prior to the Filing Date; (ii) the Registration Statement is not
         declared effective by the Commission by the Effectiveness Date; (ii)
         after the Registration Statement is filed with and declared effective
         by the Commission, the Registration Statement ceases to be effective
         (by suspension or otherwise) as to all Registrable Securities to which
         it is required to relate at any time prior to the expiration of the
         Effectiveness Period (without being succeeded immediately by an
         additional registration statement filed and declared effective) for a
         period of time which shall exceed 30 days in the aggregate per year or
         more than 20 consecutive calendar days (defined as a period of 365 days
         commencing on the date the Registration Statement is declared
         effective); or (iii) the Common Stock is not listed or quoted, or is
         suspended from trading on any Trading Market for a period of three (3)
         consecutive Trading Days (provided the Company shall not have been able
         to cure such trading suspension within 30 days of the notice thereof or
         list the Common Stock on another Trading Market); (any such failure or
         breach being referred to as an "Event," and for purposes of clause (i)
         or (ii) the date on which such Event occurs, or for purposes of clause
         (ii) the date which such 30 day or 20 consecutive day period (as the
         case may be) is exceeded, or for purposes of clause (iv) the date on
         which such three (3) Trading Day period is exceeded, being referred to
         as "Event Date"), then until the applicable Event is cured, the Company
         shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash, as liquidated damages and
         not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% for each thirty (30) day period
         (prorated for partial periods) on a daily basis of the original
         principal amount of the Note. While such Event continues, such
         liquidated damages shall be paid not less often than each thirty (30)
         days. Any unpaid liquidated damages as of the date when an Event has
         been cured by the Company shall be paid within three (3) days following
         the date on which such Event has been cured by the Company.

                                       3
<PAGE>

                  (c) Within three business days of the Effectiveness Date, the
         Company shall cause its counsel to issue a blanket opinion in the form
         attached hereto as Exhibit A, to the transfer agent stating that the
         shares are subject to an effective registration statement and can be
         reissued free of restrictive legend upon notice of a sale by the
         Purchaser and confirmation by the Purchaser that it has complied with
         the prospectus delivery requirements, provided that the Company has not
         advised the transfer agent orally or in writing that the opinion has
         been withdrawn. Copies of the blanket opinion required by this Section
         2(c) shall be delivered to the Purchaser within the time frame set
         forth above.

         3. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. If and whenever the Company is required by
the provisions hereof to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act, the Company will, as expeditiously as possible:

                  (a) prepare and file with the Commission the Registration
         Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities, respond as
         promptly as possible to any comments received from the Commission, and
         use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become and
         remain effective for the Effectiveness Period with respect thereto, and
         promptly provide to the Purchaser copies of all filings and Commission
         letters of comment relating thereto;

                  (b) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
         supplements to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
         connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions
         of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
         Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement and to
         keep such Registration Statement effective until the expiration of the
         Effectiveness Period;

                  (c) furnish to the Purchaser such number of copies of the
         Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein (including
         each preliminary Prospectus) as the Purchaser reasonably may request to
         facilitate the public sale or disposition of the Registrable Securities
         covered by the Registration Statement;

                  (d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
         qualify the Purchaser's Registrable Securities covered by the
         Registration Statement under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such
         jurisdictions within the United States as the Purchaser may reasonably
         request, provided, however, that the Company shall not for any such
         purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a
         foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or
         to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

                  (e) list the Registrable Securities covered by the
         Registration Statement with any securities exchange on which the Common
         Stock of the Company is then listed;

                  (f) immediately notify the Purchaser at any time when a
         Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
         Securities Act, of the happening of any event of which the Company has
         knowledge as a result of which the Prospectus contained in such
         Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement


                                       4
<PAGE>

         of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
         stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
         misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; and

                  (g) make available for inspection by the Purchaser and any
         attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Purchaser, all
         publicly available, non-confidential financial and other records,
         pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause
         the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all publicly
         available, non-confidential information reasonably requested by the
         attorney, accountant or agent of the Purchaser.

         4. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. All expenses relating to the Company's
compliance with Sections 2 and 3 hereof, including, without limitation, all
registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of
counsel and independent public accountants for the Company, fees and expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees) incurred in connection with complying with
state securities or "blue sky" laws, fees of the NASD, transfer taxes, fees of
transfer agents and registrars, fees of, and disbursements incurred by, one
counsel for the Holders (to the extent such counsel is required due to Company's
failure to meet any of its obligations hereunder), are called "Registration
Expenses". All selling commissions applicable to the sale of Registrable
Securities, including any fees and disbursements of any special counsel to the
Holders beyond those included in Registration Expenses, are called "Selling
Expenses." The Company shall only be responsible for all Registration Expenses.

         5. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) In the event of a registration of any Registrable
         Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the
         Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, and its
         officers, directors and each other person, if any, who controls the
         Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses,
         claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the
         Purchaser, or such persons may become subject under the Securities Act
         or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
         (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
         untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
         contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable
         Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this
         Agreement, any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus contained
         therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are
         based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
         fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Purchaser, and each such
         person for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by them in
         connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
         damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will
         not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such loss,
         claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue
         statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
         so made in conformity with information furnished by or on behalf of the
         Purchaser or any such person in writing specifically for use in any
         such document.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (b) In the event of a registration of the Registrable
         Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the
         Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its
         officers, directors and each other person, if any, who controls the
         Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses,
         claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company
         or such persons may become subject under the Securities Act or
         otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
         actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
         statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact which was
         furnished in writing by the Purchaser to the Company expressly for use
         in (and such information is contained in) the Registration Statement
         under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the
         Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, any preliminary Prospectus
         or final Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
         thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
         omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
         or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
         reimburse the Company and each such person for any reasonable legal or
         other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or
         defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, provided,
         however, that the Purchaser will be liable in any such case if and only
         to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out
         of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
         omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information
         furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Purchaser
         specifically for use in any such document. Notwithstanding the
         provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser shall not be required to
         indemnify any person or entity in excess of the amount of the aggregate
         net proceeds received by the Purchaser in respect of Registrable
         Securities in connection with any such registration under the
         Securities Act.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to claim
         indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the
         commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim
         for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against a party
         hereto obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (an "Indemnifying
         Party"), notify the Indemnifying Party in writing thereof, but the
         omission so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from
         any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party other than
         under this Section 5(c) and shall only relieve it from any liability
         which it may have to such Indemnified Party under this Section 5(c) if
         and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
         omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any
         Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the
         commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
         participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and
         undertake the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such
         Indemnified Party, and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to
         such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume and undertake the
         defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
         Indemnified Party under this Section 5(c) for any legal expenses
         subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
         defense thereof; if the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, then
         the Indemnified Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses of such
         counsel, provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action
         include both the indemnified party and the Indemnifying Party and the
         Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
         reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or
         additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the


                                       6
<PAGE>

         interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict
         with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
         shall have the right to select one separate counsel and to assume such
         legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such
         action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel
         and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by
         the Indemnifying Party as incurred.

                  (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
         the event of joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in
         which either (i) the Purchaser, or any officer, director or controlling
         person of the Purchaser, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to
         this Section 5 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final
         judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the
         expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal)
         that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case
         notwithstanding the fact that this Section 5 provides for
         indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities
         Act may be required on the part of the Purchaser or such officer,
         director or controlling person of the Purchaser in circumstances for
         which indemnification is provided under this Section 5; then, and in
         each such case, the Company and the Purchaser will contribute to the
         aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be
         subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that the
         Purchaser is responsible only for the portion represented by the
         percentage that the public offering price of its securities offered by
         the Registration Statement bears to the public offering price of all
         securities offered by such Registration Statement, provided, however,
         that, in any such case, (A) the Purchaser will not be required to
         contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all
         such securities offered by it pursuant to such Registration Statement;
         and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
         (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Act) will be entitled to
         contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such
         fraudulent misrepresentation.

         6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial

         in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and

         statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the
         periods involved (except (i) as may be otherwise indicated in such
         financial statements or the notes thereto or (ii) in the case of
         unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may not include
         footnotes or may be condensed) and fairly present in all material
         respects the financial condition, the results of operations and the
         cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated
         basis, as of, and for, the periods presented in each such SEC Report.

                  (b) The Common Stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq
         SmallCap Market and satisfies all requirements for the continuation of
         such listing. The Company has not received any notice that its Common
         Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market (except for
         prior notices which have been fully remedied) or that the Common Stock
         does not meet all requirements for the continuation of such listing.

                  (c) Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor any
         person acting on its or their behalf, has directly or indirectly made
         any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any
         security under circumstances that would cause the offering of the
         Securities pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement to be
         integrated with prior offerings by the Company for purposes of the
         Securities Act which would prevent the Company from selling the Common
         Stock pursuant to Rule 506 under the Securities Act, or any applicable
         exchange-related stockholder approval provisions, nor will the Company
         or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries take any action or steps that
         would cause the offering of the Securities to be integrated with other
         offerings.

                  (d) The Warrants, the Note and the shares of Common Stock
         which the Purchaser may acquire pursuant to the Warrants and the Note
         are all restricted securities under the Securities Act as of the date
         of this Agreement. The Company will not issue any stop transfer order
         or other order impeding the sale and delivery of any of the Registrable
         Securities at such time as such Registrable Securities are registered
         for public sale or an exemption from registration is available, except
         as required by federal or state securities laws.

                  (e) The Company understands the nature of the Registrable
         Securities issuable upon the conversion of the Note and the exercise of
         the Warrant and recognizes that the issuance of such Registrable
         Securities may have a potential dilutive effect. The Company
         specifically acknowledges that its obligation to issue the Registrable
         Securities is binding upon the Company and enforceable regardless of
         the dilution such issuance may have on the ownership interests of other
         shareholders of the Company.

                  (f) Except for agreements made in the ordinary course of
         business, there is no agreement that has not been filed with the
         Commission as an exhibit to a registration statement or to a form
         required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, the breach
         of which could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
         effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, or would prohibit or
         otherwise interfere with the ability of the Company to enter into and
         perform any of its obligations under this Agreement in any material
         respect.

                                       8

                  (g) The Company will at all times have authorized and reserved
         a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the full conversion
         of the Note and exercise of the Warrants.

         7. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a
         Holder, of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement,
         each Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being
         entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this
         Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific
         performance of its rights under this Agreement.

                  (b) NO PIGGYBACK ON REGISTRATIONS. Except as and to the extent
         specified in Schedule 7(b) hereto, neither the Company nor any of its
         security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant
         hereto) may include securities of the Company in any Registration
         Statement other than the Registrable Securities, and the Company shall
         not after the date hereof enter into any agreement providing any such
         right for inclusion of shares in the Registration Statement to any of
         its security holders. Except as and to the extent specified in Schedule
         7(b) hereto, the Company has not previously entered into any agreement
         granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities
         to any Person that have not been fully satisfied.

                  (c) COMPLIANCE. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will
         comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act
         as applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities
         pursuant to the Registration Statement.

                  (d) DISCONTINUED DISPOSITION. Each Holder agrees by its
         acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a
         notice from the Company of the occurrence of a Discontinuation Event
         (as defined below), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition
         of such Registrable Securities under the applicable Registration
         Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented
         Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement or until it is advised
         in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the applicable
         Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of
         any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed
         to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration
         Statement. The Company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce
         the provisions of this paragraph. For purposes of this Section 7(d), a
         "Discontinuation Event" shall mean (i) when the Commission notifies the
         Company whether there will be a "review" of such Registration Statement
         and whenever the Commission comments in writing on such Registration
         Statement (the Company shall provide true and complete copies thereof
         and all written responses thereto to each of the Holders); (ii) any
         request by the Commission or any other Federal or state governmental
         authority for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement
         or Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) the issuance by the
         Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such
         Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable
         Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv)
         the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
         suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any


                                       9
<PAGE>

         of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the
         initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such purpose; and/or
         (v) the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes the
         financial statements included in such Registration Statement ineligible
         for inclusion therein or any statement made in such Registration
         Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
         incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
         that requires any revisions to such Registration Statement, Prospectus
         or other documents so that, in the case of such Registration Statement
         or Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading.

                  (e) PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATIONS. If at any time during the
         Effectiveness Period there is not an effective Registration Statement
         covering all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall
         determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration
         statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of
         others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other
         than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities
         Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be
         issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or
         business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option
         or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall send to each
         Holder written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen days
         after receipt of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in
         writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all
         or any part of such Registrable Securities such holder requests to be
         registered to the extent the Company may do so without violating
         registration rights of others which exist as of the date of this
         Agreement, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks applicable to all
         holders of registration rights and subject to obtaining any required
         consent of any selling stockholder(s) to such inclusion under such
         registration statement.

                  (f) AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement,
         including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified
         or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the
         provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing
         and signed by the Company and the Holders of the then outstanding
         Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or
         consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter
         that relates exclusively to the rights of certain Holders and that does
         not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be
         given by Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities
         to which such waiver or consent relates; provided, however, that the
         provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or
         supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the
         immediately preceding sentence.

                  (g) NOTICES. Any notice or request hereunder may be given to
         the Company or the Purchaser at the respective addresses set forth

         benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of
         each of the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder. The

         deemed to be an original and, all of which taken together shall
         constitute one and the same Agreement. In the event that any signature

         valid binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf
         such signature is executed) the same with the same force and effect as
         if such facsimile signature were the original thereof.

                  (j) GOVERNING LAW. All questions concerning the construction,
         validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be
         governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal
         laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of
         conflicts of law thereof. Each party agrees that all Proceedings
         concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be commenced
         exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New
         York, Borough of Manhattan. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
         submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
         sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan for the
         adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with
         any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby
         irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any Proceeding, any

         court, that such Proceeding is improper. Each party hereto hereby
         irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process
         being served in any such Proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via

         and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained
         herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process
         in any manner permitted by law. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
         waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all
         right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
         relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. If
         either party shall commence a Proceeding to enforce any provisions of a
         Transaction Document, then the prevailing party in such Proceeding

         fees and other costs and expenses incurred with the investigation,
         preparation and prosecution of such Proceeding.

                  (k) CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. The remedies provided herein are
         cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  (l) SEVERABILITY. If any term, provision, covenant or
         restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
         jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the
         remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set
         forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
         be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use
         their reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to
         achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated
         by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby
         stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they
         would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and
         restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter
         declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

                  (m) HEADINGS. The headings in this Agreement are for
         convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect
         the meaning hereof.
