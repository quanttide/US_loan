         Item 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 23, 2004, netGuru, Inc. (the "Company") issued securities
to Laurus Master Fund, Ltd. ("Laurus") in a private placement transaction.
Laurus is an existing secured creditor of the Company and also beneficially owns
more than 5% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, disregarding
the conversion limitations described in Item 2.03. Information regarding the
transaction is incorporated into this Item 1.01 from Items 2.03, 3.02 and 9.01
of this report.

         ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION
                    UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

         On December 23, 2004, the Company entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") with Laurus. Pursuant to the Agreement, the
Company sold to Laurus a convertible note ("Convertible Note") in the original
principal amount of $1,000,000 that is scheduled to mature on December 23, 2007
("Maturity Date"). In connection with the purchase of the Convertible Note, the
Company paid Laurus Capital Management, LLC, manager of Laurus a $5,000 fee and
reimbursed Laurus for $5,000 of expenses in connection with the offering. The
net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Note will be used for working
capital.

         In connection with the Convertible Note, the Company also issued to
Laurus a five-year warrant ("Warrant") to purchase 130,000 shares of the
Company's common stock at an exercise price of $1.56 per share. The Warrant
contains a "cashless exercise" feature such that if the market price of the
Company's common stock exceeds the per share exercise price, Laurus may, at its
option, exchange the right to purchase all or part of the maximum shares
underlying the Warrant for that number of shares equal in value to the amount by
which the closing price of a share of the Company's common stock on the business
day immediately preceding the exercise date exceeds the exercise price,
multiplied by the number of shares to be purchased at that exercise price.

         The Convertible Note bears an annual interest rate of the greater of
prime rate plus 1% or 5% and requires monthly interest payments in arrears on
the first business day of each month beginning February 1, 2005 through the
Maturity Date. The interest rate may be adjusted downward following effective
registration of the shares underlying the Convertible Note with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") if certain increases occur in the closing price
of the Company's common stock.

         The Convertible Note requires monthly principal payments of $30,000
beginning July 1, 2005 through the Maturity Date. The remaining balance of
principal including any accrued and unpaid interest is due on the Maturity Date.
The Convertible Note may be repaid, in cash or through the conversion of a
portion of the Convertible Note reflecting the scheduled principal payment into
shares of the Company's common stock. Payment of the monthly principal amount by
conversion into shares must be made at the fixed conversion price of $1.29 per
share (subject to anti-dilution adjustments in connection with mergers,
acquisitions, stock splits, dividends and the like, and in connection with
future issuances of the Company's common stock at prices per share below the
then-applicable conversion price) if the following conversion criteria are met:

         (1)      the shares are registered with the SEC for public resale,
         (2)      the average closing price of the common stock for the 5
                  trading days preceding a repayment date is at least 110% of
                  the fixed conversion price, and
         (3)      the amount of such conversion does not exceed 25% of the
                  aggregate dollar trading volume of the Common Stock for the
                  30-day trading period immediately preceding the applicable
                  repayment date.

Any amount of the monthly principal amount that cannot be converted into
Company's common stock due to failure to meet the conversion criteria must be
paid at a rate of 102% of the monthly principal amount.

                                        2

         Laurus may convert at the fixed conversion price amounts due under the
Convertible Note if the underlying shares are registered for resale or an
exemption from registration is available and no event of default under the
Convertible Note remains uncured or remains unwaived by Laurus.

         In addition, Laurus is subject to a contractual 4.99% beneficial
ownership limitation that prohibits Laurus from converting the Convertible Note
and the Warrant if and to the extent that the conversion or exercise would
result in Laurus, together with its affiliates, beneficially owning more than
4.99% of the Company's outstanding common stock. However, this 4.99% limitation
automatically becomes void upon an event of default under the Convertible Note,
and can be waived by Laurus upon 75 days' advance notice to the Company,
provided that Laurus may not beneficially own more than 19.99% of the Company's
outstanding common stock. In addition, this 4.99% limitation does not prevent
Laurus from converting the Convertible Note into or exercising the Warrant for
shares of common stock and then reselling those shares in stages over time where
Laurus and its affiliates do not, at any given time, beneficially own shares in
excess of the 4.99% limitation. Further, a contractual limitation that prohibits
Laurus from converting the Convertible Note or exercising the Warrant if, and to
the extent, the conversion or exercise would result in Laurus and its affiliates
beneficially owning more than 3,767,730 shares of the Company's common stock,
will be removed if and when the Company obtains stockholder approval at Laurus'
request.

         The Company may also prepay the amount of the Convertible Note in cash
by paying 104% of the principal balance together with any accrued but unpaid
interest.

         In the event of a default and continuation of a default, Laurus may
accelerate the payment of the principal balance requiring the Company to pay
115% of the entire principal balance outstanding on that date. In the event of a
default and continuation of default, the Company is also required to pay an
additional interest at the rate of 5% per annum on all unpaid principal balance
until the default is cured or waived. Events of default that would give rise to
automatic acceleration of payment of the principal balance and an increase in
annual interest rate on unpaid principal balance include:

         o        A failure to pay principal, interest or fees;
         o        Breach of covenant, representations and warranties;
         o        A receiver or trustee for the Company is appointed;
         o        Any judgment against the Company or any of its assets in
                  excess of $250,0000 that remains unvacated, umbonded or
                  unstayed for ninety days;
         o        Bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization
                  proceedings against the Company that is not resolved within 30
                  days;
         o        Trading stop in Company's common stock that is in effect for
                  more than five days;
         o        Failure to deliver Company's stock or replacement note;
         o        Occurrence of default or continuation of default in related or
                  other agreements with Laurus; and
         o        Change in control of ownership of the Company.

         As security for payment of the Convertible Note, the Company granted to
Laurus a continuing general security interest in the Company's assets.

         The securities issued in the private placement have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and until so registered the
securities may not be re-offered or re-sold in the United States absent
registration or availability of an applicable exemption from registration. The
Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the
public resale by Laurus of the common stock to be issued upon conversion of the
Convertible Note and exercise of the Warrant.

        The registration obligations require, among other things, that the
Company file an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission no later than the 30th day following the closing date and cause the
registration statement to be declared effective no later than the 150th day
following the closing date. If the Company is unable to meet these obligations
or is unable to maintain the effectiveness of the registration in accordance
with the requirements of the Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company
will be required to pay to Laurus monthly liquidated damages equal to 1% of the
original principal amount of the Convertible Note.

        With the exception of previously disclosed issuances or stock and stock
options granted to employees and directors of the Company, the Company is
prohibited from issuing any securities, Convertible or freestanding, prior to
the full repayment or conversion of the Convertible Note together with all
related accrued and unpaid interest and fees.

         The foregoing description of the private placement does not purport to
be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Securities
Purchase Agreement, Warrant, Convertible Note, Security Agreement and
Registration Rights Agreement that are attached as exhibits to this report.

         Item 3.02.        UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         As described elsewhere in this report, on December 23, 2004, netGuru
issued securities to Laurus. Information regarding the issuances is incorporated
into this Item 3.02 from Items 1.01, 2.03 and 9.01 of this report.

         On December 8, 2004, the Company converted $104,000 of its outstanding
indebtedness under the Convertible Note issued December 4, 2003 to Laurus into
80,000 shares of its common stock. The 80,000 shares of common stock were issued
to Laurus at the fixed conversion price of $1.30 per share.

         On December 28, 2004, the Company converted $195,000 of outstanding
indebtedness under the Convertible Notes issued December 12, 2002 and December
4, 2003 to Laurus into 150,000 shares of its common stock. The 150,000 shares of
common stock were issued to Laurus at the fixed conversion price of $1.30 per
share.

         On December 28, 2004, the Company also issued 50,000 shares of its
common stock to one accredited investor upon exercise of a previously issued
warrant for total proceeds of $50,000.

         Exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 for the transactions described above is claimed under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, among others, on the basis that such transactions did
not involve any public offering and the purchasers were accredited and had
access to the kind of information registration would provide. Appropriate
investment representations were obtained, and the securities were issued with
restricted securities legends.
