thereafter, Laurus may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable and
Laurus shall have the remedies of a secured party provided in the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York, this Master Security
Agreement and other applicable law. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
and at any time thereafter, Laurus will have the right to take possession of the
Collateral and to maintain such possession on the Assignor's premises or to
remove the Collateral or any part thereof to such other premises as Laurus may
desire. Upon Laurus' request, the Assignor shall assemble the Collateral and
make it available to Laurus at a place designated by Laurus. If any notification
of intended disposition of any Collateral is required by law, such notification,
if mailed, shall be deemed properly and reasonably given if mailed at least ten
(10) days before such disposition, postage prepaid, addressed to the Assignor
either at the Assignor's address shown herein or at any address appearing on
Laurus' records for the Assignor. Any proceeds of any disposition of any of the
Collateral shall be applied by Laurus to the payment of all expenses in
connection with the sale of the Collateral, including reasonable attorneys' fees
and other legal expenses and disbursements and the reasonable expense of
retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling, and the like, and any balance of

for any deficiency.

         6. If the Assignor defaults in the performance or fulfillment of any of
the terms, conditions, promises, covenants, provisions or warranties on the
Assignor's part to be performed or fulfilled under or pursuant to this Security
Agreement, Laurus may, at its option without waiving its right to enforce this
Security Agreement according to its terms, immediately or at any time thereafter
and without notice to the Assignor, perform or fulfill the same or cause the
performance or fulfillment of the same for the Assignor's account and at the
Assignor's cost and expense, and the cost and expense thereof (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be added to the Obligations and shall be
payable on demand with interest thereon at the highest rate permitted by law.

         7. The Assignor hereby appoints Laurus, upon an Event of Default which
has not been cured within the applicable cure period, any of Laurus' officers,
employees or any other person or entity whom Laurus may designate as our
attorney, with power to execute such documents in our behalf and to supply any
omitted information and correct patent errors in any documents executed by the
Assignor or on our behalf; to file financing statements against the Assignor

neither Laurus nor the attorney will be liable for any acts of commission or
omission, nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than

coupled with an interest, is irrevocable so long as any Obligations remains
unpaid.

         8. No delay or failure on Laurus' part in exercising any right,
privilege or option hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such or of any other
right, privilege, remedy or option, and no waiver whatever shall be valid unless
in writing, signed by Laurus and then only to the extent therein set forth, and
no waiver by Laurus of any default shall operate as a waiver of any other
default or of the same default on a future occasion. Laurus' books and records
containing entries with respect to the Obligations shall be admissible in
evidence in any action or proceeding, shall be binding upon the Assignor for the
purpose of establishing the items therein set forth and shall constitute prima
facie proof thereof. Laurus shall have the right to enforce any one or more of
the remedies available to Laurus, successively, alternately or concurrently. The
Assignor agrees to join with Laurus in executing financing statements or other
instruments to the extent required by the Uniform Commercial Code in form
satisfactory to Laurus and in executing such other documents or instruments as
may be required or deemed necessary by Laurus for purposes of affecting or
continuing Laurus' security interest in the Collateral.

         9. This Security Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
