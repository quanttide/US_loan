ITEM 8.01.  Other Events

         On December 17, 2004,  Southern  Security Life  Insurance  Company (the
"Company")  received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market,  Inc.  notifying the
Company  that it did not meet the terms of an  extension  of time to comply with
the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for continued  inclusion in
the Nasdaq Stock Market as set forth in Marketplace Rule  4310(c)(7).  By letter
dated  September 1, 2004,  the Nasdaq staff had notified the Company that it did
not comply with the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares  requirement and, based
on the staff review of materials  submitted on September  16, 2004,  granted the
Company an extension until December 15, 2004 to comply with the requirement.

         In the  December  17, 2004  letter,  the staff stated that upon further
review the Company did not meet the terms of the  extension  because the Company
has neither completed the merger  transaction  involving  Security National Life
Insurance   Company  and  SSLIC  Holding  Company  resulting  in  the  Company's
securities becoming  voluntarily  delisted nor issued additional shares in order
to evidence compliance with the 500,000 publicly held shares  requirement.  As a
result,  the December 17, 2004 letter stated that the Company's  securities will
be  delisted  from the Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market at the  opening of  business  on
December 29, 2004.

         The  Company  has  filed an appeal of the  staff's  determination  to a
delisting  qualifications  panel. In this regard,  the hearing request will stay
the  delisting  of the  Company's  securities  pending a decision of a delisting
qualifications  panel.  If the  Company is not  successful  in its appeal of the
staff's decision to delist its securities,  the securities will be delisted from
the Nasdaq SmallCap  Market.  If the Company's  securities are delisted from the
Nasdaq SmallCap Market,  additional sales  requirements on  broker-dealers  will
adversely  affect the ability of shareholders to trade the Company's  securities
and the trading price of the securities could decline.

                                   SIGNATURES

         Pursuant to the  requirements  of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,
the  registrant  has duly  caused  this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.


                                        SOUTHERN SECURITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
                                        (Registrant)
