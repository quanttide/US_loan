ITEM 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS

         On December 17, 2004 MediaBay, Inc. (the "Company") received a
determination letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel ("Panel")
indicating that the Company has evidenced compliance with all requirements
necessary for continued listing on The Nasdaq National Market. On or before
December 17, 2004, the Company was required to evidence a closing bid price of
at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. Because
the Company's common stock has evidenced a closing bid price of at least $1.00
per share for more than 10 consecutive trading days, the Panel determined to
continue listing the Company's securities on The Nasdaq National Market.

         At the Company's annual meeting, held on December 15, 2004, the
shareholders approved a proposal granting the Company's directors the authority
to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of
the Company's common stock. The reason for the reverse split was to increase the
per share market price of the Company's common stock in order to comply with the
$1.00 closing bid price imposed by the Nasdaq listing requirements. Since the
Company met the Nasdaq listing requirements without a reverse split, the
Company's Board of Directors has determined that the Company will not effect a
reverse split.

         A copy of the Company's December 20, 2004 press release is annexed as
Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                  NASDAQ TO CONTINUE LISTING MEDIABAY SHARES ON
                           THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET
                   THE COMPANY WILL NOT EFFECT A REVERSE SPLIT

CEDAR KNOLLS, NJ - DECEMBER 20, 2004 -- MediaBay, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBAY), a leading
media,  marketing and publishing  company  specializing in spoken audio content,
announced  today that on December  16, 2004 it received a  determination  letter
from the staff of Nasdaq  indicating  that the Company has evidenced  compliance
with all  requirements  necessary for continued  listing on The Nasdaq  National
Market.  On or before  December 17, 2004, the Company was required to evidence a
closing  bid price of at least  $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10  consecutive
trading  days.  The Company has  evidenced a closing bid price of at least $1.00
per  share  since   November  30,   2004.   Accordingly,   the  Nasdaq   Listing
Qualifications Panel has determined to continue listing the Company's securities
on The Nasdaq National Market.

At the  Company's  annual  meeting,  held  December 15, 2004,  the  shareholders
approved a proposal granting the Company's  directors the authority to amend the
Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  to  effect  a  reverse  split  of the
Company's  common  stock.  The reason for the reverse  split was to increase the
market share of the  Company's per share market price of its common stock if the
closing bid price had failed to exceed  $1.00 as  required by Nasdaq.  Since the
Company has met the Nasdaq listing  requirements  without a reverse  split,  the
Company's  Board of Directors has determined  that the Company will not effect a
reverse split.
