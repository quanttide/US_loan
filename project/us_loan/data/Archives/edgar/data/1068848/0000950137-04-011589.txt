ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 22, 2004, the Company established a program (the "program") pursuant
to which the following incentive opportunities are to be offered to the
executive officers named below in the event the Company's exploration of
strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value leads to a change in control
of the Company (a "transaction"):

         o        Upon consummation of a transaction, each executive officer
                  named below who is then still employed by the Company will
                  receive a transaction participation bonus, in the amount
                  specified below, in recognition of his or her efforts up to
                  the date of the transaction; and

         o        Each executive officer named below who continues to be
                  employed by the Company (or its successor) for at least three
                  months after the transaction (or whose employment is
                  terminated before such time by the Company "without cause" or
                  by the executive officer for "good reason") will receive a
                  retention bonus, in the amount specified below.

</TABLE>

The foregoing incentive opportunities are in addition to any rights or
entitlements under, and subject to the limitations provided by, the executive
transition agreements previously made with the executive officers under the
Company's executive transition plan.

The program provides similar incentive opportunities for certain members of
management who are not executive officers of the Company. The maximum aggregate
amount of transaction participation bonuses and retention bonuses payable to
such persons would not exceed $6.2 million. In addition, limited severance
protections have been provided to certain members of management who are not
executive officers of the Company.

ITEM 1.02 TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 27, 2004, the Company terminated the Company's Deferred Compensation
Plan effective as of December 28, 2004 and, in connection therewith, authorized
and directed that the full amount of each plan participant's account balance be
distributed to such participant by or before December 31, 2004.
