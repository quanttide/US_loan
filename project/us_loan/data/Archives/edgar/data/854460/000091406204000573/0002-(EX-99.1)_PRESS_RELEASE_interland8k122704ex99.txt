FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                                [INTERLAND LOGO]


    INTERLAND, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS
                    NET LOSS FOR THE QUARTER OF $3.2 MILLION
               POSITIVE EBITDA1 FOR THE QUARTER OF $2.0 MILLION



ATLANTA (DECEMBER 27, 2004) - Interland, Inc. (Nasdaq:INLD),  a leading provider
of  business-class  Web  hosting and online  services to small and medium  sized
enterprises  (SMEs),  today announced its financial results for its first fiscal
quarter of 2005 ended on November 30, 2004.

The company reported revenues for the quarter of $23.1 million and a net loss of
$3.2 million,  or $0.20 per share.  EBITDA from  continuing  operations1 for the
first  quarter was positive  $2.0 million,  and capital  expenditures  were $0.8
million.

Allen L. Shulman,  Interland's Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer
stated,  "This  quarter's  results reflect  encouraging  progress as we exceeded
announced  expectations of positive EBITDA for the second  consecutive  quarter.
Our average monthly negative net MRC change2,  which was $115,000 for the fourth
quarter of 2004,  was reduced by 33% this first  quarter of fiscal 2005, to just
$77,000.  We also  reduced  the gross churn in our shared line of business to an
average of just 2.5% per month,  reflecting continuing improvement from the 2.8%
level in the  previous  quarter.  At the same  time  total  operating  costs and
expenses  have been reduced by 22% from the same quarter last year,  and our net
loss per share has been reduced by 62% over the same period."

As of  November  30,  2004,  Interland's  cash and  investment  position,  which
includes  cash  and  equivalents  of  $23.2  million,   short-term  unrestricted
investments  of $3.0 million and restricted  investments  of $10.3 million,  was
$36.5 million.


____________________________

1    EBITDA from continuing  operations is a non-GAAP  financial measure that is
     most  directly  comparable to the GAAP  financial  measure of Net Loss from
     continuing operations.  Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to both Net
     Loss from continuing  operations,  as well as to Net Cash Used in Operating
     Activities, are attached.

2    Average monthly negative net MRC change is the average monthly reduction in
     the  amount of  Monthly  Recurring  Charges  associated  with all  customer
     accounts during the relevant fiscal  quarter.  The term "Monthly  Recurring
     Charges" or "MRC",  does not include one-time or variable charges customers
     may incur,  nor is it the same as the actual  amount of revenue  recognized
     because, among other things, MRC ignores deferred revenue, and instead uses
     the charge that applies to a full month. MRC,  therefore,  is not a measure
     of  historical  revenues  but  rather  a metric  for  valuing  the  revenue
     potential  of the  entire  customer  base  as of the end of a  period.  The
     Company  believes that MRC is useful as a reflection of changes in the base
     of revenue-generating  customers and,  consequently,  as a predictor of the
     direction  of revenue in the  future.  For further  information  on MRC and
     management's assessment of its significance in understanding and projecting
     revenue trends, see Item 2 ("Management's  Discussion and Analysis") of the
     Company Quarterly Report of Form 10-Q filed December 27, 2004.

CHANNEL GROWTH

Joel Kocher,  Interland's  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated,  "We are
pleased to report that both our product and distribution  growth initiatives for
fiscal-year 2005 are on track. In Q1, we launched MyEzClicks(TM), which provides
subscribers  guaranteed  web  traffic  to their  website.  The sales of this new
product were strong,  and strengthened  throughout the quarter.  We have several
additional  products slated for introduction this year. We also made significant
progress in expanding our distribution  breadth, as Dex Media began successfully
selling our website  solutions  productline in a few markets this fall. Based on
the  successful  rollout to these  markets,  we expect to see  significant  unit
growth  from Dex as they  execute  the full  rollout to their  1,000 plus direct
sales representatives in 2005."


FUTURE GUIDANCE

The Company  announced that it expects the second quarter of fiscal 2005, ending
February  28,  2005,  to  generate  positive  EBITDA  approaching  $1 million on
revenues of about $22 million.

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) less (i) provision for income taxes, (ii)
interest income or expense,  and (iii) depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA is
not an indicator of financial  performance under generally  accepted  accounting
principles and may not be comparable to similarly captioned information reported
by  other  companies.  In  addition,  it does not  replace  net  income  (loss),
operating income (loss),  or cash flows from operating  activities as indicators
of operating  performance.  The effect of taxes and interest on Interland's  net
loss is not  significant,  but  depreciation  and  amortization,  primarily as a
result of acquisitions,  is significant. The Company believes that measuring the
performance  of  the  business  without  regard  to  non-cash  depreciation  and
amortization  can make trends in operating  results more readily  apparent,  and
when considered with other information,  assist investors and other users of the
Company's  financial  statements  who wish to evaluate the Company's  ability to
generate  future cash flows.

The  following   table  reflects  the  calculation  of  EBITDA  from  continuing
operations  and a  reconciliation  to net cash  provided by (used in)  operating
activities:
