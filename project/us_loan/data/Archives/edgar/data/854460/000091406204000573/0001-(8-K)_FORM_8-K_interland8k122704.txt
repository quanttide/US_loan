Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

     The  information  provided  pursuant  to this  Item 12 is to be  considered
"filed"  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  ("Exchange  Act")  and
incorporated by reference into those filings of Interland,  Inc. (the "Company")
that provide for the  incorporation  of all reports and  documents  filed by the
Company under the Exchange Act.

     On December 27, 2004,  the Company  issued a press  release  regarding  its
financial  results for its fiscal  quarter  ended  November 30, 2004.  Interland
hereby  incorporates by reference  herein the information set forth in its Press
Release  dated  December 27, 2004, a copy of which is annexed  hereto as Exhibit
99.1.

     The earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures.  For purposes of
Regulation  G,  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  a  numerical  measure  of a
registrant's  historical or future financial performance,  financial position or
cash flows that excludes  amounts,  or is subject to  adjustments  that have the
effect of excluding amounts,  that are included in the most directly  comparable
measure  calculated  and presented in  accordance  with GAAP in the statement of
income,  balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent  statements) of
the issuer;  or includes  amounts,  or is subject to  adjustments  that have the
effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable
measure so calculated  and presented.  In this regard,  GAAP refers to generally
accepted  accounting  principles in the United States.  These non-GAAP financial
measures  have  been  presented  because  management  uses this  information  in
monitoring and evaluating the Company's  on-going  financial  results and trends
and believes that as a result, this information will be useful to investors. The
disclosure in this Form 8-K of any financial information shall not constitute an
admission that such  information is material.  Pursuant to the  requirements  of
Regulation G, Interland has provided reconciliations within the earnings release
of  the  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP
financial measures.
