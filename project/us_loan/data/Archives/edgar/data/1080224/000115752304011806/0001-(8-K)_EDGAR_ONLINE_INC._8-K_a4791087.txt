Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On December 27, 2004, EDGAR Online, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a new
Employment Agreement with Greg Adams (the "Agreement"), the Company's current
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and a member of the Company's
board of directors, replacing Mr. Adam's prior employment agreement dated as of
February 1, 2002.

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will employ Mr. Adams as Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Operating Officer for a two-year term, unless the Agreement is
terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Thereafter, the Agreement will
automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless terminated by either
party thirty days prior to the end of the initial or any renewal period. Under
the Agreement, Mr. Adams will receive a minimum base salary of $210,000 and will
be entitled to participate in an incentive bonus program based upon the
achievement of certain performance objectives established by the Company or the
Company's compensation committee. Mr. Adams will also receive a commutation
allowance of $1,500 per month. In addition, the Agreement provides that Mr.
Adams will be issued a stock option to purchase 150,000 shares of the Company's
common stock at a price per share equal to the closing price per share of the
Company's common stock on December 27, 2004.

The Agreement may be terminated by the Company for "cause" or due to Mr. Adams's
death or disability. If there is a change of control of the Company and the
Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Mr. Adams within the term, or
if the Agreement is terminated by the Company other than for "cause," Mr.
Adams's death or disability, or if Mr. Adams terminates the Agreement for "good
reason," Mr. Adams will receive the cost of outplacement counseling of up to
$25,000 and a severance payment equal to 1.5 times the sum of his then
applicable base salary and the average of his last two cash bonuses. If the
Company does not renew the Agreement, Mr. Adams is entitled to a severance
payment equal to the sum of his then applicable base salary and the average of
his last two cash bonuses. The Agreement also contains certain restrictive
covenants and other prohibitions against Mr. Adams for a one-year period
following the effective date of termination, including that which prohibits him
from competing with the Company or soliciting its employees or customers. A copy
of the Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.44 and is incorporated herein
by reference.
