<PAGE>


"Agreements." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings assigned to
them in the Agreements.

         In rendering this opinion letter, as to relevant factual matters we
have examined the documents described above and such other documents as we have
deemed necessary including, where we have deemed appropriate, representations or
certifications of officers of parties thereto or public officials. In rendering
this opinion letter, except for the matters that are specifically addressed in
the opinions expressed below, with your permission we have assumed, and are
relying thereon without independent investigation, (i) the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals or as copies thereof, and the conformity
to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies, (ii) the necessary
entity formation and continuing existence in the jurisdiction of formation, and
the necessary licensing and qualification in all jurisdictions, of all parties
to all documents, (iii) the necessary authorization, execution, delivery and
enforceability of all documents, and the necessary entity power with respect
thereto, and (iv) that there is not any other agreement that modifies or
supplements the agreements expressed in any document to which this opinion
letter relates and that renders any of the opinions expressed below inconsistent
with such document as so modified or supplemented. In rendering this opinion
letter, except for the matters that are specifically addressed in the opinions
expressed below, we have made no inquiry, have conducted no investigation and
assume no responsibility with respect to (a) the accuracy of and compliance by
the parties thereto with the representations, warranties and covenants as to
factual matters contained in any document or (b) the conformity of the
underlying assets and related documents to the requirements of any agreement to
which this opinion letter relates.

         This opinion letter is based upon our review of the documents referred
to herein. We have conducted no independent investigation with respect to the
facts contained in such documents and relied upon in rendering this opinion
letter. We also note that we do not represent any of the parties to the
transactions to which this opinion letter relates or any of their affiliates in
connection with matters other than certain transactions. However, the attorneys
in this firm who are directly involved in the representation of parties to the
transactions to which this opinion letter relates, after such consultation with
such other attorneys in this firm as they deemed appropriate, have no actual
present knowledge of the inaccuracy of any fact relied upon in rendering this
opinion letter.

         In rendering this opinion letter, we do not express any opinion
concerning any law other than the federal income tax laws of the United States,
including without limitation the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the
"Code") applicable to a real estate mortgage investment conduit ("REMIC") We do
not express any opinion herein with respect to any matter not specifically
addressed in the opinions expressed below, including without limitation (i) any
statute, regulation or provision of law of any county, municipality or other
political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof or (ii) the
securities or tax laws of any jurisdiction.

         The tax opinions set forth below are based upon the existing provisions
of applicable law and regulations issued or proposed thereunder, published
rulings and releases of applicable agencies or other governmental bodies and
existing case law, any of which or the effect of any of which could change at
any time. Any such changes may be retroactive in application and could modify
the legal conclusions upon which such opinions are based. The opinions expressed


<PAGE>

herein are limited as described below, and we do not express any opinion on any
other legal or income tax aspect of the transactions contemplated by the
documents relating to the transaction.

         Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that:

         1.       Each of the Agreements to which the Seller or the Depositor is
                  a party (to the extent that the laws of the State of New York
                  are designated therein as the governing law thereof), assuming
                  the necessary power and authority therefor and authorization,
                  execution and delivery thereof by the parties thereto (other
                  than any party as to which we opine to that effect herein) and
                  the enforeability thereof ( except as limited by bankruptcy
                  and other insolvency laws) against the other parties thereto,
                  is a valid and legally binding agreement under the laws of the
                  State of New York, enforceable thereunder in accordance with
                  its terms against the Depositor or the Seller, as the case may
                  be.

         2.       The Certificates, assuming the necessary entity power and
                  authority therefor, authorization, execution, authentication
                  and delivery thereof and payment therefor in accordance with
                  the applicable Agreements, are validly issued and outstanding
                  and are entitled to the benefits of the Pooling and Servicing
                  Agreement.

         3.       Assuming the accuracy of and compliance with the factual
                  representations, covenants and other provisions of the
                  Agreements without any waiver or modification thereof, for
                  United States federal income tax purposes within the meaning
                  of the Code in effect on the date hereof, (i) each of REMIC 1,
                  REMIC 2, REMIC 3, REMIC 4 and REMIC 5 will qualify as a REMIC,
                  (ii) the REMIC 1 Regular Interests will represent ownership of
                  "regular interests" in REMIC 1, and the Class R-1 Interest
                  will constitute the sole class of "residual interests" in
                  REMIC 1, (iii) the REMIC 2 Regular Interests will represent
                  ownership of the "regular interests" in REMIC 2, and the Class
                  R-2 Interest will constitute the sole class of "residual
                  interests" in REMIC 2, (iv) the Adjustable-Rate Certificates
                  (exclusive of any right to receive payments from the Net WAC
                  Rate Carryover Reserve Account), the Class CE Interest and the
                  Class P Interest will represent ownership of "regular
                  interests" in REMIC 3 and will generally be treated as debt
                  instruments of REMIC 3, and the Class R-3 Interest will
                  constitute the sole class of "residual interests" in REMIC 3,
                  (v) the Class CE Certificates will represent ownership of the
                  "regular interests" in REMIC 4, and the Class R-4 Interest
                  will constitute the sole class of "residual interests" in
                  REMIC 4, (vi) the Class P Certificates will represent
                  ownership of the "regular interests" in REMIC 5, and the Class
                  R-5 Interest will constitute the sole class of the "residual
                  interests" in REMIC 5, (vii) the Class R Certificates will
                  represent ownership of the Class R-1 Interest, the Class R-2
                  Interest and the Class R-3 Interest and (viii) the Class R-X
                  Certificates will represent ownership of the Class R-4
                  Interest and the Class R-5 Interest.
