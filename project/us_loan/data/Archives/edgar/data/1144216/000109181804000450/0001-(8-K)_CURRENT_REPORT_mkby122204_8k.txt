McKenzie Bay subsidiary WindStor Power Co. is preparing to commercialize
WindStor(SM), a wind powered distributed energy system that will be installed
free to the customer at urban and off-grid sites. WindStor Power Co. will sell
electricity at fixed, long-term, rates directly to urban energy consumers such
as: schools, industrial, office, apartment and commercial buildings; and, off-
grid users such as remote and island communities.

WindStor adds self-generated wind energy from its vertical axis wind turbine and
electricity storage to the primary electricity source and selects the lowest
cost electricity input for the system via a proprietary "WindStor System
Integrator". Designed and configured to work with existing sources of
electricity (the "grid", diesel, etc.), WindStor could simultaneously provide an
uninterruptible, standby, power supply for the entire facility in the event of a
grid failure at no additional cost.
