Item 8.01.        OTHER EVENTS.

         On or about December 29, 2004, the Registrant will cause the issuance
and sale, among other things, of approximately $1,567,513,000 initial principal
amount of Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities I Trust 2004-HE11, Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-HE11, Class I-A-1, Class I-A-2, Class I-A-3, Class
II-A-1, Class II-A-2, Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5 and
Class M-6 Certificates (the "Underwritten Certificates") pursuant to a Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2004, among Bear Stearns Asset
Backed Securities I LLC, as depositor, EMC Mortgage Corporation, as seller and
master servicer and LaSalle Bank National Association, as trustee.

         In connection with the sale of the Underwritten Certificates, the
Registrant has been advised by Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and WaMu Capital Corp.
(the "Underwriters"), that the Underwriters have furnished to prospective
investors certain computational materials (the "Computational Materials") with
respect to the Underwritten Certificates following the effective date of
Registration Statement No. 333-113636, which Computational Materials are being
filed as exhibits to this report.

         The Computational Materials have been provided by the Underwriters. The
information in the Computational Materials is preliminary and may be superseded
by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Certificates and by any other
information subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The Computational Materials were prepared by the Underwriters at the
request of certain prospective investors, based on assumptions provided by, and
satisfying the special requirements of, such prospective investors. The
Computational Materials may be based on assumptions that differ from the
assumptions set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. The Computational Materials
may not include, and do not purport to include, information based on assumptions
representing a complete set of possible scenarios. Accordingly, the
Computational Materials may not be relevant to or appropriate for investors
other than those specifically requesting them.

         In addition, the actual characteristics and performance of the mortgage
loans underlying the Underwritten Certificates (the "Mortgage Loans") may differ
from the assumptions used in the Computational Materials, which are hypothetical
in nature and which were provided to certain investors only to give a general
sense of how the yield, average life, duration, expected maturity, interest rate
sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of the Underwritten Certificates might
vary under varying prepayment and other scenarios. Any difference between such
assumptions and the actual characteristics and performance of the Mortgage Loans
will affect the actual yield, average life, duration, expected maturity,
interest rate sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of the Underwritten
Certificates.
