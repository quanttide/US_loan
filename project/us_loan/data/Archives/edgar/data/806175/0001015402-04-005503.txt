                EPIPHARMA SECURITIES BEGIN TRADING ON PINK SHEETS

     SCOTTSDALE,  AZ  -  December 17, 2004 - EpiPharma, Inc. ("EpiPharma") (Pink
Sheets:  EPHM) began trading on the Pink Sheets on December 14, 2004.  EpiPharma
was  formed  on  September  13th, 2001 as a subsidiary of Baywood International,
Inc.  ("Baywood")  (OTCBB:  BYWD)  to focus on the development and production of
complex  nutraceuticals  and  other  novel  technologies  for  therapeutic
applications.  At  this  time,  EpiPharma's objective is to facilitate Baywood's
acquisition  of  Aidan  Products,  L.L.C.  ("Aidan"),  a specialty nutraceutical
company  with  annual  sales  of  over  $1,000,000  focusing  on  immunology and
angiogenesis  products  that  are sold through healthcare practitioner channels.
The letter of intent to acquire Aidan was originally announced by Baywood on May
19,  2004.

     "Since  Baywood  announced  the  letter of intent to acquire Aidan, we have
been  diligently  pursuing  a number of structures to finance this transaction,"
stated  Neil  Reithinger,  C.E.O.  and  President  of  Baywood  and President of
EpiPharma.  "We  believe  that  by quoting EpiPharma on the Pink Sheets and then
subsequently  utilizing  EpiPharma  as  a vehicle to complete the acquisition of
Aidan,  we will be afforded the most practical structure that enables Baywood to
complete  this  transaction  while limiting further dilution to existing Baywood
shareholders  at  our  current  share  price,"  Reithinger  further  explained.

     The  acquisition  is  subject  to  the  execution  of a mutually acceptable
purchase  agreements,  financing and customary closing conditions, including the
receipt  of  necessary  approvals  by  third  parties.

     Commenting  on  the  prospects  for the growth of EpiPharma, Mr. Reithinger
stated, "In addition to building on our core, proprietary products, we also plan
on  growing  EpiPharma  via  acquisition.  We  are  always  seeking  out quality
companies  that  would  complement  our existing business and that would help us
enhance  shareholder  value."
