ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

     On  December  21,  2004,  Eaton  Vance  Corp.  (the  "Company")  executed a
revolving  credit  facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as  administrative  agent,
J.P. Morgan  Securities  Inc., as lead arranger and sole bookmaker,  and Bank of
America.  Citibank,  N.A., Credit Suisse First Boston,  PNC Bank, N.A., UBS Loan
Finance LLC and Wachovia  Bank,  N.A., as lenders.  The  Company's  wholly owned
subsidiary,  Eaton Vance  Management  ("EVM") acts as guarantor of the Company's
obligations  under the facility.  The facility,  which expires in December 2009,
provides that EVC may borrow up to $180 million at LIBOR-based rates of interest
that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and the credit ratings
of certain notes issued by EVM. The agreement contains financial  covenants with
respect to leverage  and  interest  coverage  and requires the Company to pay an
annual commitment fee on any unused portion.

     The facility  replaced a credit facility between EVM and several banks that
allowed EVM to borrow up to $170 million under similar terms and conditions. The
EVM facility terminated in accordance with its terms on December 21, 2004.

     EVM, as investment  advisor to certain Eaton Vance closed-end  mutual funds
has entered into Shareholder  Servicing  Agreements and Underwriting  Agreements
with UBS  Securities,  LLC,  an  affiliate  of UBS Loan  Finance.  In  addition,
affiliates of the other lenders on occasion act as underwriters of certain Eaton
Vance close-end mutual funds.

                                   The Credits

     SECTION 2.01.  Commitments.  Subject to the terms and  conditions set forth
herein,  each  Lender  agrees to make  Loans to the  Borrower  from time to time
during the  Availability  Period in an aggregate  principal amount that will not
result in (a) such Lender's Exposure  exceeding such Lender's  Commitment or (b)
the sum of the total  Exposures  exceeding  the total  Commitments.  Within  the
foregoing  limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,  the
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Loans.

     SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings.  (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of
a Borrowing  consisting of Loans made by the Lenders  ratably in accordance with
their  respective  Commitments.  The  failure  of any  Lender  to make  any Loan
required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its  obligations
hereunder;  provided  that the  Commitments  of the  Lenders  are several and no
Lender  shall be  responsible  for any other  Lender's  failure to make Loans as
required.

     (b) Subject to Section 2.11, each Borrowing shall be comprised  entirely of
ABR  Loans or  Eurodollar  Loans  as the  Borrower  may  request  in  accordance
herewith.  Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any
domestic  or  foreign  branch or  Affiliate  of such  Lender to make such  Loan;
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (c)  At the  commencement  of  each  Interest  Period  for  any  Eurodollar
Borrowing,  such Borrowing  shall be in an aggregate  amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than  $5,000,000.  At the time that each ABR
Borrowing is made,  such  Borrowing  shall be in an aggregate  amount that is an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000;  provided that an
ABR Borrowing  may be in an aggregate  amount that is equal to the entire unused

                                       15
<PAGE>
balance  of the  total  Commitments.  Borrowings  of more  than  one Type may be
outstanding at the same time;  provided that there shall not at any time be more
than a total of ten (10) Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

     (d)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this  Agreement,  the Borrower
shall not be  entitled  to  request,  or to elect to  convert or  continue,  any
Borrowing if the Interest Period  requested with respect thereto would end after
the Termination Date.

     SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a Borrowing, the Borrower
shall notify the  Administrative  Agent of such  request by  telephone  prior to
10:00 a.m.,  New York City time (a) three  Business  Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing or (b) one Business Day
before the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of an ABR Borrowing.  Each
such  telephonic  Borrowing  Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the  Administrative  Agent of a written
Borrowing  Request  signed by the Chief  Accounting  Officer  (or any  successor
position thereof),  the Treasurer or the Chief Financial Officer, in the form of
Exhibit  B  attached  hereto  or  such  other  form  as may be  approved  by the
Administrative  Agent,  which Borrowing Request shall be signed by the Borrower.
Each such telephonic and written  Borrowing  Request shall specify the following
information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
     Borrowing;

          (iv) in the  case of a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the  initial  Interest
     Period to be applicable  thereto,  which shall be a period  contemplated by
     the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

          (v) the location and number of the  Borrower's  account to which funds
     are to be disbursed,  which shall comply with the  requirements  of Section
     2.04.

If no election as to the Type of  Borrowing  is  specified,  then the  requested
Borrowing  shall be an ABR  Borrowing.  If no Interest  Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed
to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.  Promptly following
receipt  of  a  Borrowing   Request  in  accordance   with  this  Section,   the
Administrative  Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                                       16
<PAGE>
     SECTION 2.04.  Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan
to be made by it  hereunder on the  proposed  date  thereof by wire  transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the  Administrative  Agent most  recently  designated  by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative  Agent will make such Loans available
to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to
an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative  Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower in the Borrowing Request.

          (b) Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from a
     Lender prior to the proposed  date of any  Borrowing  that such Lender will
     not make available to the Administrative  Agent such Lender's share of such
     Borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent may assume that such Lender has made
     such share  available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
     Section and may, in reliance upon such  assumption,  make  available to the
     Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
     made its share of the applicable  Borrowing available to the Administrative
     Agent, then the applicable  Lender and the Borrower  severally agree to pay
     to the Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding  amount
     with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount
     is made  available to the Borrower to but  excluding the date of payment to
     the  Administrative  Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender,  the Federal
     Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
     then applicable to such  Borrowing.  If such Lender pays such amount to the
     Administrative  Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
     included in such Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.05. Interest Elections.  (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of
the Type  specified in the  applicable  Borrowing  Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a  different  Type  or to  continue  such  Borrowing  and,  in the  case of a
Eurodollar  Borrowing,  may elect Interest Periods therefor,  all as provided in
this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected  Borrowing,  in which case each such  portion  shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing,
and the Loans  comprising  each such  portion  shall be  considered  a  separate
Borrowing.

     (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify
the  Administrative  Agent of such  election  by  telephone  by the time  that a
Borrowing  Request  would be required  under  Section 2.03 if the Borrower  were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type  resulting  from such  election to be made on
the effective  date of such election.  Each such  telephonic  Interest  Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the  Administrative  Agent of a written Interest Election Request in
the form of Exhibit C attached  hereto or such other form as may be  approved by
the Administrative Agent, which Interest Election Request shall be signed by the
Borrower.

     (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                                       17
<PAGE>
          (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and,
     if different  options are being elected with respect to different  portions
     thereof,  the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting  Borrowing
     (in which case the  information  to be specified  pursuant to clauses (iii)
     and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

          (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
     Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the  resulting  Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (iv)  if  the  resulting  Borrowing  is a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the
     Interest  Period  to be  applicable  thereto  after  giving  effect to such
     election,  which shall be a period  contemplated  by the  definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest  Election Request requests a Eurodollar  Borrowing but does
not  specify  an  Interest  Period,  then the  Borrower  shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

     (d)  Promptly  following  receipt  of an  Interest  Election  Request,  the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

     (e) If the Borrower  fails to deliver a timely  Interest  Election  Request
with respect to a Eurodollar  Borrowing  prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at
the  end of  such  Interest  Period  such  Borrowing  shall  be  continued  as a
Eurodollar  Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding any
contrary  provision  hereof,  (a) if an Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders,
so notifies the Borrower,  then,  so long as an Event of Default is  continuing,
each  Eurodollar  Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (b) no Loan may be converted into or
continued  as a Eurodollar  Borrowing  after the date that is one month prior to
the Termination Date.

     SECTION  2.06.  Termination  and  Reduction  of  Commitments.   (a)  Unless
previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date.

     (b) The  Borrower may at any time  terminate,  or from time to time reduce,
the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in
an  amount  that  is an  integral  multiple  of  $1,000,000  and not  less  than
$5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower  shall not terminate or reduce the  Commitments
if, after giving effect to any concurrent  prepayment of the Loans in accordance
with Section 2.08, the sum of the Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.

     (c) The Borrower shall notify the  Administrative  Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least
three  Business  Days  prior  to the  effective  date  of  such  termination  or

                                       18
<PAGE>
reduction,  specifying  such election and the effective  date thereof.  Promptly
following  receipt of any notice,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant
to this Section shall be  irrevocable;  provided that a notice of termination of
the  Commitments  delivered  by the  Borrower  may  state  that  such  notice is
conditioned  upon the  effectiveness of other credit  facilities,  in which case
such  notice  may be revoked by the  Borrower  (by notice to the  Administrative
Agent on or prior to the  specified  effective  date) if such  condition  is not
satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments  shall be permanent.
Each  reduction of the  Commitments  shall be made ratably  among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

     SECTION 2.07. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby
unconditionally  promises to pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account of
each Lender the then  unpaid  principal  amount of each Loan on the  Termination
Date (or such earlier date on which the Loans become due and payable pursuant to
Article VII).

     (b) Each Lender shall  maintain in  accordance  with its usual  practice an
account or accounts  evidencing the  Indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

     (c) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  accounts in which it shall
record  (i) the amount of each Loan made  hereunder,  the Type  thereof  and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and  payable or to become due and payable  from the  Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

     (d) The entries made in the accounts  maintained  pursuant to paragraph (b)
or (c) of this  Section  shall be prima  facie  evidence  of the  existence  and
amounts of the obligations  recorded  therein;  provided that the failure of any
Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent to  maintain  such  accounts  or any error
therein shall not in any manner  affect the  obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (e)  Any  Lender  may  request  that  Loans  made by it be  evidenced  by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,  execute and deliver
to such  Lender a  promissory  note  payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender,  to such Lender and its  registered  assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative  Agent.  Thereafter,  the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest  thereon shall at all times  (including  after
assignment  pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented  by one or more  promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named  therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

     SECTION 2.08. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from  time to time to  prepay  any  Borrowing  in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

     (b) The  Borrower  shall  notify  the  Administrative  Agent  by  telephone

prepayment of an ABR  Borrowing,  not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one  Business  Day  before the date of  prepayment.  Each such  notice  shall be

each Borrowing or portion  thereof to be prepaid;  provided that, if a notice of
prepayment is given in connection  with a conditional  notice of  termination of
the  Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.06, then such notice of prepayment
may be revoked if such  notice of  termination  is  revoked in  accordance  with
Section  2.06.  Promptly  following  receipt of any such  notice  relating  to a
Borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent shall  advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof.  Each partial  prepayment of any  Borrowing  shall be in an amount that
would be  permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as
provided  in Section  2.02.  Each  prepayment  of a  Borrowing  shall be applied

(whether used or unused),  during the period from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if
such  Lender  continues  to have any  outstanding  Loans  after  its  Commitment
terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the average daily
amount of such Lender's  outstanding  Loans from and including the date on which
its Commitment  terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases
to have any outstanding Loans. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears
on the last day of March,  June,  September and December of each year and on the
date on which the  Commitments  terminate,  commencing on the first such date to
occur after the date hereof;  provided that any facility fees accruing after the
date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility
fees shall be  computed  on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).

     (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account
of each Lender a utilization  fee equal to the Applicable  Utilization  Fee Rate
per annum for each day on which the Commitment  Utilization  Percentage  exceeds
50%,  which fee shall  accrue on the daily amount of such  Lender's  outstanding
Loans for each Excess  Utilization  Day during the period from and including the
day on which the Commitment  Utilization Percentage exceeds 50% to but excluding
the day on which the  Commitment  Utilization  Percentage no longer exceeds 50%.
Accrued  utilization  fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March,
June,  September  and  December  of  each  year  and on the  date on  which  the
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof;  provided that any utilization fees accruing after the date on which the
Commitments  terminate shall be payable on demand. All utilization fees shall be
computed  on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

     (c) The Borrower  agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent,  for its own
account,  fees  payable in the amounts and at the times  separately  agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                                       20
<PAGE>
     (d)  All  fees  payable  hereunder  shall  be  paid on the  dates  due,  in
immediately  available funds, to the Administrative  Agent for distribution,  in
the case of facility and utilization  fees, to the Lenders.  Fees paid shall not
be refundable under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.10.  Interest.  (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall
bear  interest  at a rate per annum  equal to the  Alternate  Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin.

     (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect
for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

     (c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if any principal of or interest on any
Loan or any fee or other amount  payable by the  Borrower  hereunder is not paid
when due,  whether at stated  maturity,  upon  acceleration  or otherwise,  such
overdue amount shall bear interest,  after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise  applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of
any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.

     (d)  Accrued  interest  on each Loan  shall be  payable  in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant
to paragraph (c) of this Section  shall be payable on demand,  (ii) in the event
of any  repayment or  prepayment  of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR
Loan  prior to the end of the  Availability  Period),  accrued  interest  on the
principal  amount  repaid  or  prepaid  shall  be  payable  on the  date of such
repayment or prepayment,  (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar
Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,  accrued interest
on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such  conversion and (iv)
all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the Commitments.

     (e) All interest  hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days,  except that interest  computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at
times when the Alternate  Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed
on the  basis of a year of 365 days  (or 366 days in a leap  year),  and in each
case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day).  The applicable  Alternate Base Rate,  Adjusted
LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be presumptively correct.

     SECTION 2.11.  Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a) the Administrative  Agent determines (which determination shall be
     presumptively  correct) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
     ascertaining  the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as  applicable,  for
     such Interest Period; or

          (b) the  Administrative  Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
     the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as  applicable,  for such Interest
     Period will not  adequately  and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
     making or  maintaining  their  Loans  included in such  Borrowing  for such
     Interest Period;

                                       21
<PAGE>
then the Administrative  Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders,  which notice shall state the circumstances giving rise to such notice,
by telephone or telecopy as promptly as  practicable  thereafter  and, until the
Administrative   Agent   notifies   the   Borrower  and  the  Lenders  that  the
circumstances  giving  rise to such  notice no longer  exist,  (i) any  Interest
Election   Request  that  requests  the  conversion  of  any  Borrowing  to,  or
continuation  of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar  Borrowing  shall be ineffective
and  (ii)  if any  Borrowing  Request  requests  a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.12. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,  special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit  extended  by, any Lender  (except any such  reserve  requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

          (ii)  impose on any  Lender or the London  interbank  market any other
     condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase  the cost to such
Lender of making or  maintaining  any  Eurodollar  Loan (or of  maintaining  its
obligation  to make any such Loan) or to increase  the cost to such Lender or to
reduce the amount of any sum  received or  receivable  by such Lender  hereunder
(whether of  principal,  interest or  otherwise),  then the Borrower will pay to
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

     (b) If any  Lender  determines  that any  Change in Law  regarding  capital
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company,  if any, as
a consequence  of this Agreement or the Loans made  hereunder,  to a level below
that which such Lender or such Lender's  holding company could have achieved but
for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the
policies of such  Lender's  holding  company with respect to capital  adequacy),
then from time to time the  Borrower  will pay to such  Lender  such  additional
amount or  amounts  as will  compensate  such  Lender or such  Lender's  holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

     (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts, together
with a full  explanation of the increased  costs,  the Change in Law giving rise
thereto and the  calculation  of such amount or amounts  necessary to compensate
such  Lender  or its  holding  company,  as the case  may be,  as  specified  in
paragraph  (a) or (b) of this  Section and further  stating  that such Lender is
requiring   corresponding  payments  from  other  similarly  situated  borrowers
generally,  shall be  delivered  to the  Borrower  and  shall  be  presumptively
correct.  The  Borrower  shall  pay such  Lender  the  amount so due on any such
certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof and a full description
and calculation of such amount or amounts.

     (d)  Failure  or delay on the part of any  Lender  to  demand  compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such  compensation;  provided that the Borrower  shall not be required to

                                       22
<PAGE>
compensate  a  Lender  pursuant  to this  Section  for any  increased  costs  or
reductions  incurred  more than six  months  prior to the date that such  Lender
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such  increased  costs
or reductions  and of such Lender's  intention to claim  compensation  therefor;
provided  further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive,  then the six-month period referred to above shall
be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

     SECTION 2.13.  Break Funding  Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of
any principal of any  Eurodollar  Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable  thereto  (including as a result of an Event of Default),  (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period  applicable  thereto,  (c) the  failure to borrow,  convert,  continue or
prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice  delivered  pursuant  hereto
(regardless  of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable  under  Section
2.08(b) and is revoked in  accordance  herewith)  or (d) the  assignment  of any
Eurodollar  Loan other than on the last day of the  Interest  Period  applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, then,
in any such event,  the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost
and  expense  attributable  to such event;  provided  that any such event is not
attributable  to the  failure  of any  Lender  to fund a Loan.  In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender  attributable to any such event shall be
deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess,
if any, of (i) the amount of interest  that such Lender  would pay for a deposit
equal to the principal  amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such
payment,  conversion,  failure or assignment to the last day of the then current
Interest  Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,  convert
or continue,  the duration of the Interest  Period that would have resulted from
such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such
deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Eurodollar  Loan)
for such  Interest  Period,  over (ii) the amount of  interest  that such Lender
would earn on such  principal  amount  for such  period if such  Lender  were to
invest such principal  amount for such period at the interest rate that would be
bid by such Lender (or an  affiliate of such  Lender) for dollar  deposits  from
other banks in the  eurodollar  market at the  commencement  of such  period.  A
certificate of any Lender  setting forth any amount or amounts,  together with a
full explanation of the losses, costs, and expenses incurred,  the events giving
rise thereto and the  calculation  of such amount or amounts that such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be  presumptively  correct.  The  Borrower  shall pay such  Lender the
amount so due on any such  certificate  within 10  Business  Days after  receipt
thereof.

     SECTION  2.14.  Taxes.  (a) Any and all  payments  by or on  account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction  for any  Indemnified  Taxes  or  Other  Taxes;  provided  that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments,  then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after  making  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to
additional sums payable under this Section) the  Administrative  Agent or Lender
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received
had no such  deductions  been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions
and (iii)  the  Borrower  shall pay the full  amount  deducted  to the  relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                                       23
<PAGE>
     (b) In  addition,  the  Borrower  shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender
within 10 Business Days after written  demand  therefor,  for the full amount of
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or  attributable  to amounts  payable under this Section)
paid by the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender,  as the case may be, and any
penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising  therefrom or with respect
thereto,  whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the  relevant  Governmental   Authority.   A
certificate  as to the amount of such  payment  or  liability  delivered  to the
Borrower  by a Lender  or by the  Administrative  Agent on its own  behalf or on
behalf  of  a  Lender,  shall  be  presumptively  correct.  To  the  extent  the
Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a refund or credit on account of any
Indemnified  Tax or Other  Tax  reimbursed  by the  Borrower  or as a result  of
contesting  any  Indemnified  Tax or Other Tax  pursuant  to this  Section,  the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly pay over
the amount of such refund or credit to the Borrower.

     (d) As soon as practicable  after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such  Governmental  Authority  evidencing  such  payment,  a copy of the  return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

     (e) Any Foreign  Lender that is entitled to an exemption  from or reduction
of withholding  tax under the law of the  jurisdiction  in which the Borrower is
located,  or any treaty to which such  jurisdiction is a party,  with respect to
payments under this Agreement  shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative  Agent),  at the time or times  prescribed by  applicable  law or
reasonably  requested by the  Borrower,  such  properly  completed  and executed
documentation  prescribed by  applicable  law as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

     SECTION 2.15. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment;  Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The  Borrower  shall make each  payment  required to be made by it hereunder
(whether of principal,  interest,  fees, or under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or
otherwise)  prior to 12:00  noon,  New York City time,  on the date when due, in
immediately  available  funds,  without  set-off or  counterclaim.  Any  amounts
received   after  such  time  on  any  date  may,  in  the   discretion  of  the
Administrative  Agent,  be deemed to have been  received on the next  succeeding
Business Day for purposes of  calculating  interest  thereon.  All such payments
shall be made to the  Administrative  Agent,  c/o The Loan and  Agency  Services
Group at the address set forth in Section 9.01, except that payments pursuant to
Sections  2.12,  2.13,  2.14 and  9.03  shall be made  directly  to the  Persons
entitled thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate  recipient
promptly  following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business  Day,  the date for payment  shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in dollars.

                                       24
<PAGE>
     (b) If at any time insufficient  funds are received by and available to the
Administrative  Agent to pay fully all amounts of  principal,  interest and fees
then due hereunder,  such funds shall be applied (i) first,  to pay interest and
fees  then  due  hereunder,  ratably  among  the  parties  entitled  thereto  in
accordance  with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties,  and
(ii) second,  to pay  principal  then due  hereunder,  ratably among the parties
entitled  thereto in accordance  with the amounts of principal  then due to such
parties.

     (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim
or otherwise,  obtain  payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any
of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater  proportion
of the  aggregate  amount of its Loans and  accrued  interest  thereon  than the
proportion  received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)  participations  in the Loans
of  other  Lenders  to the  extent  necessary  so that the  benefit  of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans;  provided
that (i) if any such  participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
and  the  purchase  price  restored  to the  extent  of such  recovery,  without
interest,  and (ii) the provisions of this  paragraph  shall not be construed to
apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
express  terms  of  this  Agreement  or any  payment  obtained  by a  Lender  as
consideration  for the  assignment of or sale of a  participation  in any of its
Loans  to any  assignee  or  participant,  other  than  to the  Borrower  or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate  thereof (as to which the  provisions of this  paragraph
shall apply).  The Borrower  consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may  effectively  do so under  applicable  law,  that any Lender  acquiring a
participation  pursuant to the foregoing  arrangements  may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim  with respect to such  participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct  creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

     (d) Unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have  received  notice from the
Borrower  prior to the date on which any  payment  is due to the  Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders  hereunder  that the Borrower will not make
such  payment,  the  Administrative  Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
such payment on such date in accordance  herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption,  distribute  to the Lenders  the amount  due. In such event,  if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment,  then each of the Lenders  severally
agrees to repay to the  Administrative  Agent  forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed  to such  Lender  with  interest  thereon,  for  each  day  from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

     (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment  required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or 2.15(d),  then the  Administrative  Agent may, in
its  discretion  (notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  hereof),  apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative  Agent for the account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender's  obligations  under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

     SECTION 2.16.  Mitigation  Obligations;  Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any
Lender requests  compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the

                                       25
<PAGE>
account of any Lender  pursuant  to Section  2.14,  then such  Lender  shall use
reasonable  efforts to  designate  a  different  lending  office for  funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its  offices,  branches or  affiliates,  if, in the  judgment of such
Lender,  such  designation or assignment  (i) would  eliminate or reduce amounts
payable  pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would
not otherwise be  disadvantageous  to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to
pay all reasonable costs and expenses  incurred by any Lender in connection with
any such designation or assignment.

     (b) If any Lender  requests  compensation  under  Section  2.12,  or if the
Borrower  is  required  to  pay  any  additional  amount  to any  Lender  or any
Governmental  Authority for the account of any Lender  pursuant to Section 2.14,
or if any Lender  defaults in its obligation to fund Loans  hereunder,  then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative  Agent,  require  such  Lender to assign  and  delegate,  without
recourse  (in  accordance  with and  subject to the  restrictions  contained  in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such  obligations  (which  assignee may be another
Lender,  if a Lender  accepts such  assignment);  provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the  outstanding  principal of its Loans,  accrued
interest  thereon,  accrued fees and all other amounts  payable to it hereunder,
from the  assignee  (to the extent of such  outstanding  principal  and  accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other  amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section  2.12 or payments  required to be made  pursuant to Section  2.14,  such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required  to make any such  assignment  and  delegation  if,  prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,  the circumstances
entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

     SECTION 2.17. New Lenders;  Commitment  Increases.  (a) With the consent of
the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative   Agent  (which,  in  the  case  of  the
Administrative  Agent,  shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld),  (i) one or more
additional banks or other financial institutions or other institutional investor
may become a party to this Agreement by executing a supplement  hereto,  in form
and substance  satisfactory to such bank, financial institution or institutional
investor,  the  Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent,  whereupon  such bank,
financial institution or institutional  investor (a "New Lender") shall become a
Lender for all purposes  hereof and to the same extent as if  originally a party
hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement, and
Schedule 2.01 hereto shall be deemed to be amended to add the name,  address and
Commitment of such New Lender and (ii) any Lender may increase the amount of its
Commitment by executing a supplement hereto, in form and substance  satisfactory
to such Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, whereupon such Lender
shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to
the full amount of its  Commitment  as so  increased,  and Schedule  2.01 hereto
shall be deemed to be amended to reflect such increase in the Commitment of such
Lender.   In  no  event  may  the  aggregate   Commitments  be  increased  above
$225,000,000 pursuant to any supplement described in this Section 2.17(a).

                                       26
<PAGE>
     (b) If on the date  upon  which a bank or other  financial  institution  or
institutional  investor becomes a New Lender or upon which a Lender's Commitment
is changed  pursuant to Section  2.17(a),  any Loans are then  outstanding,  the
Administrative  Agent will  consult  with the  Borrower  with the  objective  of
minimizing  the costs to the  Borrower,  and may (A) require  that the  Borrower
prepay  and  reborrow  any  outstanding  Loans  in  connection  therewith  if it
determines such action to be desirable to facilitate  administration  under this
Agreement in such amount and with such Interest  Period such that,  after giving
effect thereto, the quotient of (x) the Loan of such Lender of each Type and, in
the case of Eurodollar  Loans,  with each Interest  Period and (y) such Lender's
Commitment  is equal to the  corresponding  comparable  quotient  of each  other
Lender and (B) with the consent of such Lender  permit the Borrower to select an
initial  Interest  Period with respect to the initial  Loans made by such Lender
having  a  duration  other  than  one,  two,   three,   or  six  months  if  the
Administrative  Agent  determines  such  action to be  desirable  to  facilitate
administration  of the Loans  under this  Agreement.  Any  Eurodollar  Borrowing
borrowed pursuant to the preceding  sentence shall bear interest at a rate equal
to the respective  interest rates then applicable to the Eurodollar Loans of the
other  Lenders or such other rate as may be agreed upon by the Borrower and such
Lender.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

     Each of the  Borrower  and the  Guarantor  (as to  itself)  represents  and
warrants to the Lenders that:

     SECTION  3.01.   Organization;   Powers.  Each  of  the  Borrower  and  its
Subsidiaries is duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the  jurisdiction  of its  organization,  has all  requisite  power  and
authority  to carry on its  business  as now  conducted  and,  except  where the
failure to do so,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  could not  reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good  standing  in, every  jurisdiction  where such  qualification  is
required.

     SECTION 3.02.  Authorization;  Enforceability.  The Transactions are within
the powers of the Borrower and the  Guarantor  and have been duly  authorized by
all necessary actions by the directors or trustees  thereof.  This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of the Borrower and the  Guarantor,  as
the case may be, and  constitutes a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the
Borrower and the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  or other laws
affecting  creditors'  rights  generally  and subject to general  principles  of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

     SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do
not require any consent or approval  of,  registration  or filing  with,  or any
other action by, any Governmental  Authority,  except such as have been obtained
or made or will have been  obtained or made by the Closing  Date and are in full
force and effect,  (b) will not violate in any material  respect any  applicable
law  or  regulation,  (c)  will  not  violate  the  charter,  by-laws  or  other

                                       27
<PAGE>
organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order
of any Governmental Authority, (d) will not violate or result in a default under
any material indenture,  agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets,  or give rise to a right thereunder to
require any payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries,  and
(e) will not result in the creation or  imposition  of any material  Lien on any
asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 3.04.  Financial  Condition;  No Material  Adverse Effect.  (a) The
Borrower has heretofore  furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet
and statements of income,  beneficial interests and cash flows (i) as of and for
the fiscal  years  ended 2001,  2002 and 2003,  reported on by Deloitte & Touche
LLP, independent public accountants,  and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarters
and the portion of the fiscal year ended  January 31,  2004,  April 30, 2004 and

Disclosed  Matters,  there  are no  actions,  suits or  proceedings,  or, to the
knowledge  of the  Borrower,  investigations,  by or before  any  arbitrator  or

     SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws,  regulations and orders of any
Governmental  Authority  applicable  to it or its property  and all  indentures,
agreements and other instruments  (including any material investment advisory or

(b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not  reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably  expected
to occur that,  when taken  together  with all other such ERISA Events for which
liability  is  reasonably  expected to occur,  could  reasonably  be expected to

                                       29
<PAGE>

of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,  exceed by more
than  $5,000,000  the fair  market  value of the  assets of such  Plan,  and the
present value of all accumulated  benefit  obligations of all underfunded  Plans

Material Adverse Effect. None of the reports, financial statements, certificates
or  other  information  furnished  by  or on  behalf  of  the  Borrower  to  the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender in connection  with the  negotiation of this
Agreement  or  delivered   hereunder  (as  modified  or  supplemented  by  other
information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements  therein,  in the light

with respect to projected  financial  information,  the Borrower represents only
that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed
to be reasonable at the time.

     SECTION 3.12. No Default.  As of the Effective  Date,  neither the Borrower
nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is in default  under or with respect to any of its
Contractual Obligations in any respect that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material  Adverse  Effect.  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

options,  warrants, calls, rights or other agreements or commitments (other than
stock  options  or  restricted  stock  granted to  employees  or  directors  and
directors' qualifying shares) of any nature relating to any Capital Stock of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary.

     SECTION  3.14.  Federal  Regulations.  No part of the proceeds of any Loans
will be used for "buying" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective
meanings of each of the quoted terms under  Regulation U as now and from time to
time  hereafter  in effect in any manner that  violates  the  provisions  of the
Regulations  of the Board or for any other purpose that violates the  provisions
of  the   Regulations  of  the  Board.   If  requested  by  any  Lender  or  the
Administrative  Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and
each  Lender  a  statement  to the  foregoing  effect  in  conformity  with  the
requirements  of FR Form  G-3 or FR Form  U-1,  as  applicable,  referred  to in
Regulation  U. No more than 25% of the  consolidated  assets of the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries  (excluding  treasury  shares) consist of "margin stock" under
Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.

transactions)  all or substantially  all of its assets,  or all or substantially
all of the Capital Stock of any of its Subsidiaries  (in each case,  whether now
owned or hereafter acquired),  or liquidate or dissolve,  except that, if at the
time thereof and  immediately  after giving effect thereto no Default shall have
occurred and be  continuing  (i) any other Person,  including a Subsidiary,  may
merge into the Borrower in a transaction  in which the Borrower is the surviving
Person, (ii) any Subsidiary may merge into any other Subsidiary in a transaction
in which the surviving  entity is a Subsidiary,  (iii) any  Subsidiary may sell,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its assets to the Borrower or to another
Subsidiary,  (iv) any  Subsidiary  may  liquidate  or dissolve  if the  Borrower
determines in good faith that such  liquidation  or  dissolution  is in the best
interests of the Borrower and which could not  reasonably  be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (v) the Borrower may merge into or consolidate with
another  Person in a  transaction  in which such other  Person is the  surviving
entity if such other Person is organized and validly  existing under the laws of
the United  States or any State  thereof and by  operation  of law or  otherwise
assumes  all  obligations  of the  Borrower  hereunder  and such  assumption  is
evidenced by an opinion of counsel to such other Person satisfactory in form and
substance to the  Administrative  Agent in its reasonable  discretion;  provided
that any such merger  involving a Person that is not a wholly  owned  Subsidiary
immediately prior to such merger shall not be permitted unless also permitted by
Section  6.05.  In the  event  of any  merger  or  consolidation  involving  the
Guarantor,  or in the event of any sale,  transfer or other  disposition  by the
Guarantor of all or substantially all of its assets, in either case as permitted
above  in  this  section  6.04(a),  the  surviving  Person  of  such  merger  or
consolidation  (if the surviving  Person is not the Guarantor) or the transferee
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor,  as the case may be,
shall  expressly  assume all of the  obligations,  duties and liabilities of the
Guarantor  hereunder in a manner reasonably  satisfactory to the  Administrative
Agent; and, no such merger or consolidation, and no such sale, transfer or other
disposition,  shall be permitted hereunder in the absence of such an assumption.
For the  avoidance of doubt,  any transfer by the Guarantor of the Capital Stock

                                       38
<PAGE>
owned by it in Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc. to the Borrower shall be permitted

required to assume the  obligations,  duties and  liabilities  of the  Guarantor
hereunder.

engage to any material  extent in any business other than businesses of the type

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  The Guarantee

     SECTION 8.01. Guarantee.  (a) The Guarantor hereby,  jointly and severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable  benefit of the  Lenders  and their  respective  successors,  indorsees,
transferees and assigns,  the prompt and complete payment and performance by the
Borrower when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise)
of the Borrower Obligations.

     (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,  the maximum liability
of the  Guarantor  hereunder  shall in no event  exceed the amount  which can be
guaranteed by the Guarantor under applicable  federal and state laws relating to
the insolvency of debtors  (after giving effect to the right of subrogation  and
contribution established in Section 8.02).

     (c) The Guarantor agrees that the Borrower  Obligations may at any time and
from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of the Guarantor  hereunder
without  impairing  the  guarantee  contained in this Section 8 or affecting the
rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder.

     (d) The  guarantee  contained  in this Section 8 shall remain in full force
and  effect  until  all the  Borrower  Obligations  and the  obligations  of the
Guarantor  under the  guarantee  contained  in this  Section  8 shall  have been
satisfied  by payment in full and the  Commitments  shall have been  terminated,
notwithstanding  that from time to time  during the term of this  Agreement  the
Borrower may be free from any Borrower Obligations.

     (e) No payment made by the Borrower, the Guarantor,  any other guarantor or
any other  Person or received or collected  by the  Administrative  Agent or any
Lender from the Borrower, the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person
by virtue  of any  action or  proceeding  or any  set-off  or  appropriation  or

                                       43
<PAGE>
application  at any time or from time to time in  reduction  of or in payment of
the Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise
affect the liability of the Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any
such  payment  (other than any payment  made by the  Guarantor in respect of the
Borrower  Obligations or any payment received or collected from the Guarantor in
respect of the Borrower Obligations), remain liable for the Borrower Obligations
up to the  maximum  liability  of the  Guarantor  hereunder  until the  Borrower
Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.  The provisions
of Section 2.14 shall apply to payments by the Guarantor under this Article VIII
(with appropriate changes therein to refer to the Guarantor and such payments as
necessary).

     SECTION  8.02.  No  Subrogation.  Notwithstanding  any payment  made by the
Guarantor  hereunder or any set-off or  application of funds of the Guarantor by
the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender, the Guarantor shall not be entitled to
be  subrogated  to any of the rights of the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender
against the Borrower or any collateral  security or guarantee or right of offset
held by the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Borrower
Obligations,   nor  shall  the  Guarantor  seek  or  be  entitled  to  seek  any
contribution or  reimbursement  from the Borrower in respect of payments made by
the Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders by the Borrower on account of the Borrower  Obligations  are paid in
full and the  Commitments  are  terminated.  If any amount  shall be paid to the
Guarantor  on  account  of such  subrogation  rights at any time when all of the
Borrower Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held
by the  Guarantor  in  trust  for the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Lenders,
segregated from other funds of the Guarantor,  and shall, forthwith upon receipt
by the Guarantor,  be turned over to the Administrative  Agent in the exact form
received by the Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Guarantor to the  Administrative
Agent,  if required),  to be applied against the Borrower  Obligations,  whether
matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine.

     SECTION 8.03.  Amendments,  etc. with Respect to The Borrower  Obligations.
The Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder  notwithstanding that, any of the
following may occur,  without notice to or further assent by the Guarantor,  (i)
any  demand  for  payment  of  any  of  the  Borrower  Obligations  made  by the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender and any of the Borrower Obligations continued,  (ii) the Borrower
Obligations,  or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof,
or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect
thereto,  may,  from time to time,  in whole or in part,  be renewed,  extended,
amended, modified, accelerated,  compromised, waived, surrendered or released by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (iii) the Credit Agreement and the other
Loan  Documents  and any other  documents  executed and  delivered in connection
therewith may be amended,  modified,  supplemented or terminated, in whole or in
part, as the  Administrative  Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders,  as
the case may be) may deem  advisable  from time to time, or (iv) any  collateral
security,  guarantee  or right of offset at any time held by the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender for the  payment of the  Borrower  Obligations  may be sold,
exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any Lender shall have any obligation to protect,  secure,  perfect or insure any
Lien at any time held by it as security for the Borrower  Obligations or for the
guarantee  contained in this Section 8 or any property subject thereto.

     SECTION 8.04.  Guarantee Absolute and  Unconditional.  The Guarantor waives
any and all notice of the creation,  renewal, extension or accrual of any of the
Borrower  Obligations  and notice of or proof of reliance by the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Section 8 or acceptance
of the guarantee contained in this Section 8; the Borrower Obligations,  and any
of them,  shall  conclusively  be  deemed to have been  created,  contracted  or
incurred,  or  renewed,  extended,  amended  or  waived,  in  reliance  upon the
guarantee contained in this Section 8; and all dealings between the Borrower and
the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on
the other  hand,  likewise  shall be  conclusively  presumed to have been had or
consummated  in reliance  upon the  guarantee  contained  in this Section 8. The
Guarantor waives diligence,  presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice
of default or  nonpayment  to or upon the Borrower  with respect to the Borrower
Obligations.  The Guarantor  understands and agrees that the guarantee contained
in this Section 8 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional
guarantee of payment without regard to (a) any defense,  set-off or counterclaim
(other  than a  defense  of  payment  or  performance)  which may at any time be
available  to or be asserted by the  Borrower  or any other  Person  against the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender,  or (b) any other  circumstance  whatsoever
(with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or the Guarantor)  which
constitutes,  or  might  be  construed  to  constitute,  an  equitable  or legal
discharge  of the Borrower for the  Borrower  Obligations,  or of the  Guarantor
under the  guarantee  contained in this Section 8, in bankruptcy or in any other
instance.  When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and
remedies hereunder against the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender
may, but shall be under no obligation  to, make a similar demand on or otherwise
pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other
Person  or  against  any  collateral  security  or  guarantee  for the  Borrower
Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto,  and any failure by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other
rights or  remedies or to collect any  payments  from the  Borrower or any other
Person or to  realize  upon any such  collateral  security  or  guarantee  or to
exercise  any such right of offset,  or any release of the Borrower or any other
Person or any such collateral security,  guarantee or right of offset, shall not
relieve the Guarantor of any  obligation or liability  hereunder,  and shall not
impair or affect the rights and remedies,  whether express, implied or available
as a matter  of law,  of the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender  against  the
Guarantor.  For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the  commencement and
continuance of any legal proceedings.

     SECTION  8.05.  Reinstatement.  The  guarantee  contained in this Section 8
shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated,  as the case may be, if at any
time  payment,  or any  part  thereof,  of any of the  Borrower  Obligations  is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative  Agent
or any Lender  upon the  insolvency,  bankruptcy,  dissolution,  liquidation  or
reorganization  of the  Borrower or the  Guarantor or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver,  intervenor or conservator  of, or trustee or similar
officer  for,  the  Borrower or the  Guarantor  or any  substantial  part of its
property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

     SECTION 8.06.  Payments.  The  Guarantor  hereby  guarantees  that payments
hereunder  will  be  paid  to  the  Administrative   Agent  without  set-off  or
counterclaim in Dollars at the office of the Administrative Agent.

                            The Administrative Agent

     Except as provided below, each of the Lenders hereby  irrevocably  appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise  such powers as are delegated to
the  Administrative  Agent by the terms  hereof,  together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

     The bank serving as the Administrative  Agent hereunder shall have the same
rights  and  powers in its  capacity  as a Lender as any  other  Lender  and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative  Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally  engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any  Subsidiary or other  Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

     The  Administrative  Agent shall not have any duties or obligations  except
those  expressly  set forth  herein.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of the
foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other  implied  duties,  regardless  of whether a Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  (b) the  Administrative  Agent  shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary  powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required  to  exercise  in writing by the  Required  Lenders,  and (c) except as
expressly set forth herein, the Administrative  Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose,  and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,  any information
relating to the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or
in  the  absence  of  its  own  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct.  The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written  notice  thereof is given to the  Administrative  Agent by the
Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative  Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to  ascertain or inquire  into (i) any  statement,  warranty or
representation made by any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement,
(ii) the contents of any certificate,  report or other document delivered by any
other Person  hereunder or in  connection  herewith,  (iii) the  performance  or
observance of any of the covenants,  agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein, (iv) the validity,  enforceability,  effectiveness (other than its
own due  execution) or  genuineness  of this  Agreement or any other  agreement,
instrument or document,  or (v) the  satisfaction  of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

     The  Administrative  Agent shall be  entitled  to rely upon,  and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any  statement  made to it orally or by  telephone  and
believed  by it to be made  by the  proper  Person,  and  shall  not  incur  any
liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative  Agent may consult with legal

                                       46
<PAGE>
counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other
experts  selected  by it, and shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or not
taken by it in accordance  with the advice of any such counsel,  accountants  or
experts.

     The  Administrative  Agent may perform any and all its duties and  exercise
its rights and powers through Related Parties of the  Administrative  Agent. The
exculpatory  provisions of the preceding  paragraphs  shall apply to the Related
Parties of the  Administrative  Agent,  and shall apply to their  activities  in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities  provided for herein as
well as activities as Administrative Agent.

     Subject to the  appointment  and  acceptance of a successor  Administrative
Agent as provided in this paragraph,  the Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation,  the
Required  Lenders shall have the right,  in consultation  with the Borrower,  to
appoint  a  successor.  If no  successor  shall  have been so  appointed  by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such  appointment  within 30 days after
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent gives notice of its  resignation,  then the
retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York,
or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the  acceptance  of its  appointment  as
Administrative  Agent hereunder by a successor,  such successor shall succeed to
and become  vested with all the  rights,  powers,  privileges  and duties of the
retiring  Administrative  Agent, and the retiring  Administrative Agent shall be
discharged  from its duties and obligations  hereunder.  The fees payable by the
Borrower to a successor  Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its  predecessor  unless  otherwise  agreed  between  the  Borrower  and such
successor.   After  the  Administrative  Agent's  resignation   hereunder,   the
provisions  of this  Article and Section  9.03 shall  continue in effect for its
benefit in respect  of any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as Administrative Agent.

     Each Lender  acknowledges  that it has,  independently and without reliance
upon the  Administrative  Agent or any other Lender and based on such  documents
and information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also  acknowledges  that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent or any
other Lender and based on such  documents and  information as it shall from time
to time deem  appropriate,  continue to make its own  decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement,  any related  agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

communications  expressly  permitted to be given by  telephone,  all notices and
other  communications  provided  for  herein  shall be in  writing  and shall be
delivered  by  hand  or  overnight  courier  service,  mailed  by  certified  or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

     Steul,  Chief Financial Officer (Telecopy No. (617) 426-2487);  with a copy
     to the Chief Legal  Officer of the Borrower and to Nixon Peabody LLP at 100
     Summer Street, Boston, MA 02110, Attention: Craig D. Mills.

          (b) if to the  Administrative  Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. c/o

     JPMorgan  Chase  Bank,  N.A.  270 Park  Avenue,  New York,  New York 10017,
     Attention of Marybeth Mullen (Telecopy No. (212) 270-5100); and

          (c) if to any other Lender,  to it at its address (or telecopy number)
     set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications  hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

     SECTION  10.02.  Waivers;  Amendments.  (a)  No  failure  or  delay  by the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender in exercising  any right or power  hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise of
any such  right or  power,  or any  abandonment  or  discontinuance  of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the  exercise  of any other  right or power.  The  rights  and  remedies  of the
Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders  hereunder  are  cumulative  and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any  provision  of this  Agreement  or consent to any  departure by the Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective  unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph  (b) of this  Section,  and  then  such  waiver  or  consent  shall be
effective  only in the  specific  instance  and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not
be  construed  as  a  waiver  of  any   Default,   regardless   of  whether  the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender may have had  notice or  knowledge  of such
Default at the time.

     (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,  amended
or modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or agreements  in writing  entered
into by the  Borrower  and  the  Required  Lenders  or by the  Borrower  and the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;  provided that no

                                       48
<PAGE>
such  agreement  shall (i) increase  the  Commitment  of any Lender  without the
written consent of such Lender,  (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
reduce  the rate of  interest  thereon,  or reduce any fees  payable  hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,  (iii) postpone the
scheduled  date of payment of the principal  amount of any Loan, or any interest
thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any  such  payment,  or  postpone  the  scheduled  date  of  expiration  of  any
Commitment,  without the written consent of each Lender affected  thereby,  (iv)
change Section  2.15(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments  required thereby,  without the written consent of each Lender,  (v)
release the Guarantor from its Guarantee  contained herein,  without the written
consent of each Lender,  or (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or
the definition of "Required  Lenders" or any other provision  hereof  specifying
the number or  percentage  of  Lenders  required  to waive,  amend or modify any
rights  hereunder  or make any  determination  or grant any  consent  hereunder,
without  the  written  consent of each  Lender;  provided  further  that no such
agreement  shall amend,  modify or otherwise  affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative  Agent  hereunder  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  the
Administrative Agent.

     SECTION 10.03. Expenses;  Indemnity;  Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower shall
pay  (i) all  reasonable,  documented  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by the
Administrative  Agent and its  Affiliates  in  amounts  previously  agreed to in
writing and the reasonable  fees,  charges and  disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative   Agent,  in  connection  with  the  syndication  of  the  credit
facilities  provided for herein,  the  preparation  and  administration  of this
Agreement or any amendments,  modifications or waivers of the provisions  hereof
(whether  or not the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  or  thereby  shall  be
consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any  Lender,  including  the fees,  charges  and  disbursements  of any
counsel for the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender,  in  connection  with the
enforcement  or  protection  of its rights in  connection  with this  Agreement,
including its rights under this Section,  or in connection  with the Loans made,
including in  connection  with any workout,  restructuring  or  negotiations  in
respect thereof.

     (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative  Agent and each Lender,
and each Related Party of any of the  foregoing  Persons (each such Person being
called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,  costs and related expenses, including
the  reasonable  fees,   charges  and  disbursements  of  any  counsel  for  any
Indemnitee,  incurred by or asserted  against any Indemnitee  arising out of, in
connection  with,  or as a  result  of (i) the  execution  or  delivery  of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or the use of the proceeds  therefrom,  (iii) any actual or alleged  presence or
release of Hazardous  Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,  or any Environmental  Liability related in
any way to the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or (iv)  any  actual  or
prospective claim,  litigation,  investigation or proceeding  relating to any of
the  foregoing,  whether  based  on  contract,  tort  or any  other  theory  and
regardless  of whether any  Indemnitee  is a party  thereto;  provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any  Indemnitee,  be available to the extent that (a)

                                       49
<PAGE>
such  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities,  costs or  related  expenses  are
determined  by a court of competent  jurisdiction  by a final and  nonappealable
judgment to have  resulted from the gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct of
such Indemnitee or (b) any such losses, damages, liabilities,  costs, or related
expenses  solely arise out of any  successful  claim made by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary against any such Indemnitee.

     (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount  required to be
paid  by it to the  Administrative  Agent  under  paragraph  (a) or (b) of  this
Section,  each Lender severally agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent such
Lender's  Applicable  Percentage  (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed  expense or  indemnity  payment is sought) of such  unpaid  amount;
provided that the  unreimbursed  expense or  indemnified  loss,  claim,  damage,
liability  or related  expense,  as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

     (d) To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  the  Borrower  shall not
assert,  and hereby waives,  any claim against any Indemnitee,  on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect,  consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages)  arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this  Agreement or any  agreement or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  the
Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

     (e) All amounts due under this  Section  shall be payable not later than 30
days after written  demand  therefor  accompanied  by  documentation  reasonably
describing the basis for such amounts.

     SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may
not assign or  otherwise  transfer  any of its rights or  obligations  hereunder
without the prior written  consent of each Lender (and any attempted  assignment
or  transfer  by the  Borrower  without  such  consent  shall be null and void).
Nothing in this  Agreement,  expressed or implied,  shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective  successors and
assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly  contemplated  hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more  assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations  under this Agreement  (including all or a portion of its
Commitment  and the Loans at the time owing to it);  provided that (i) except in
the case of an assignment  to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender,  each of the
Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent must give their prior written consent to
such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  (ii) except
in the case of an  assignment  to a Lender  or an  Affiliate  of a Lender  or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's  Commitment,
and the  Loans at the time  owing  to it or in the  case of an  assignment  to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender,
the aggregate  amount of the Commitment  (which for this purpose  includes Loans
outstanding  thereunder)  shall not be less than  $5,000,000  unless each of the
Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent  otherwise  consent,  (iii) each partial
assignment  shall be made as an  assignment of a  proportionate  part of all the
assigning  Lender's rights and obligations  under this Agreement with respect to

                                       50
<PAGE>
the Loan or the Commitment  assigned,  (iv) the parties to each assignment shall
execute and deliver to the  Administrative  Agent an Assignment and  Acceptance,
together with a processing and  recordation fee of $3,500 (the obligation to pay
such  fee to be  shared  equally  by the  assignor  and  assignee),  and (v) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
an  Administrative  Questionnaire;  provided  further  that any  consent  of the
Borrower  otherwise  required under this  paragraph  shall not be required if an
Event of Default  under  clause (h) or (i) of Article  VII has  occurred  and is
continuing.  Upon  acceptance  and  recording  pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
Section,  from and after the effective  date  specified in each  Assignment  and
Acceptance,  the assignee  thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,  have the rights and
obligations  of  a  Lender  under  this  Agreement,  and  the  assigning  Lender
thereunder  shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance,  be released from its obligations  under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  covering all of the  assigning  Lender's
rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12,
2.13,  2.14 and  9.03).  Any  assignment  or  transfer  by a Lender of rights or
obligations  under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be  treated  for  purposes  of this  Agreement  as a sale by  such  Lender  of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of
this Section.

     (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the  Borrower,  shall  maintain  at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each  Assignment and  Acceptance  delivered to it and a register for the
recordation  of the names and addresses of the Lenders,  and the  Commitment of,
and  principal  amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender  pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary.

     (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed  Administrative
Questionnaire  (unless the assignee  shall already be a Lender  hereunder),  the
processing and  recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and
any  written  consent  to such  assignment  required  by  paragraph  (b) of this
Section,  the  Administrative  Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance
and record the  information  contained  therein in the  Register.  No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph.

     (e)  Any  Lender  may,   without  the  consent  of  the   Borrower  or  the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a  "Participant")  in all or a portion of such Lender's  rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it);  provided that (i) such Lender's  obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such  obligations  and (iii) the
Borrower,  the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation  shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the  sole  right  to  enforce  this  Agreement  and to  approve  any  amendment,

                                       51
<PAGE>
modification  or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement;  provided that such
agreement  or  instrument  may provide  that such  Lender will not,  without the
consent  of the  Participant,  agree to any  amendment,  modification  or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject  to  paragraph  (f) of this  Section,  the  Borrower  agrees  that  each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 to
the  same  extent  as if it were a  Lender  and had  acquired  its  interest  by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

     (f) A  Participant  shall not be entitled  to receive  any greater  payment
under Section 2.12 or 2.14 than the  applicable  Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation  sold to such  Participant,  unless
the sale of the  participation  to such  Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 unless the Borrower
is notified of the  participation  sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees,  for the  benefit of the  Borrower,  to comply with  Section  2.14(e) as
though it were a Lender.

     (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure  obligations of such
Lender,  including  without  limitation  (i) any such pledge or  assignment to a
Federal  Reserve  Bank,  and (ii) in the case of any Lender that is a Fund,  any
pledge or assignment  of all or any portion of such  Lender's  rights under this
Agreement to any holders of  obligations  owed,  or securities  issued,  by such
Lender as security for such obligations or securities, or to any trustee for, or
any other representative of such holders and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security  interest;  provided that no such pledge
or  assignment  of a security  interest  shall  release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.

     SECTION 10.05.  Survival.  All covenants,  agreements,  representations and
warranties  made  by  the  Borrower  herein  and in the  certificates  or  other
instruments  delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered  to have been  relied  upon by the  other  parties  hereto  and shall
survive  the  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement  and the making of any
Loans,  regardless of any  investigation  made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding  that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect  representation  or warranty
at the time any credit is extended  hereunder,  and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as the  principal  of or any accrued  interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount  payable  under this  Agreement is  outstanding  and
unpaid  and so long as the  Commitments  have not  expired  or  terminated.  The
provisions of Sections 2.12,  2.13, 2.14 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive
and  remain in full  force and  effect  regardless  of the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination  of the  Commitments  or the  termination  of this  Agreement or any
provision hereof.

     SECTION 10.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may
be  executed in  counterparts  (and by  different  parties  hereto on  different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken  together  shall  constitute a single  contract.  This  Agreement  and any
separate letter  agreements  with respect to fees payable to the  Administrative
Agent  constitute the entire contract among the parties  relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous  agreements and understandings,

                                       52
<PAGE>
oral or written,  relating to the subject matter  hereof.  Except as provided in
Section 4.01,  this  Agreement  shall become  effective  when it shall have been
executed by the  Administrative  Agent and when the  Administrative  Agent shall
have  received  counterparts  hereof  which,  when  taken  together,   bear  the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto,  and thereafter shall be binding
upon and  inure to the  benefit  of the  parties  hereto  and  their  respective
successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this  Agreement  by  telecopy  shall be  effective  as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

     SECTION  10.07.  Severability.  Any provision of this  Agreement held to be
invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to  such
jurisdiction,  be  ineffective to the extent of such  invalidity,  illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity,  legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a  particular  jurisdiction  shall not  invalidate  such  provision in any other
jurisdiction.

     SECTION 10.08.  Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final) at any time
held and  other  Indebtedness  at any time  owing by such  Lender  to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower  against any of and all the obligations of
the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement and although  such  obligations  may be unmatured.  The rights of each
Lender  under  this  Section  are in  addition  to  other  rights  and  remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

     SECTION 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction;  Consent to Service of Process.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of New York.

     (b)  Each  of  the  Borrower  and  the  Guarantor  hereby  irrevocably  and
unconditionally  submits,  for  itself  and its  property,  to the  nonexclusive
jurisdiction  of the Supreme  Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States  District Court of the Southern  District of New
York,  and any  appellate  court from any thereof,  in any action or  proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement,  or for recognition or enforcement
of any  judgment,  and  each  of  the  parties  hereto  hereby  irrevocably  and
unconditionally  agrees  that  all  claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or
proceeding  may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided  by law.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  affect any right that the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender may  otherwise  have to bring any action or
proceeding  relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (c)  Each  of  the  Borrower  and  the  Guarantor  hereby  irrevocably  and
unconditionally  waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection  which it may now or hereafter  have to the laying of venue of
any suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any court  referred to in  paragraph  (b) of this  Section.  Each of the parties

                                       53
<PAGE>
hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

     (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner  provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing in this  Agreement
will  affect the right of any party to this  Agreement  to serve  process in any
other manner permitted by law.

     SECTION 10.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,  TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY  IN ANY  LEGAL  PROCEEDING  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  ARISING  OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED  HEREBY  (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT,  TORT OR ANY OTHER  THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO  REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS  REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY  OR  OTHERWISE,  THAT SUCH  OTHER  PARTY  WOULD  NOT,  IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION,  SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES  HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

     SECTION  10.11.  Headings.  Article and Section  headings  and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement  and  shall  not  affect  the   construction  of,  or  be  taken  into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.12.  Confidentiality.  (a) The Borrower  acknowledges  that from
time to time financial  advisory,  investment  banking and other services may be
offered or  provided  to the  Borrower  or one or more of its  Subsidiaries  (in
connection  with this  Agreement or  otherwise)  by any Lender or by one or more
subsidiaries  or  affiliates of such Lender and the Borrower  hereby  authorizes
each Lender,  subject to applicable  federal or state  securities laws, to share
any  information  delivered to such Lender by the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to
enter  into  this  Agreement,   to  any  such  subsidiary  or  affiliate.   Such
authorization  shall  survive the  repayment  of the Loans,  the  expiration  or
termination  of the  Commitments  or the  termination  of this  Agreement or any
provision hereof.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein,  neither the Lenders
nor the  Administrative  Agent may disclose to any Person any  information  that
constitutes  material  non-public  information  regarding  the  Borrower  or its
securities  for  purposes  of  Regulation  FD of  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission or any other federal or state securities laws (it being  acknowledged
and agreed  that the  provisions  of this  Section  10.12  with  respect to such
information  are reasonably  necessary to comply with  Regulation FD and/or such
other  federal  and  state  securities  laws)  (such  information   referred  to
collectively   herein  as  the   "Borrower   Information"),   except   that  the
Administrative  Agent and each of the Lenders may disclose Borrower  Information
(i) to its and its affiliates' officers, employees, counsel and agents (it being
understood  that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of

                                       54
<PAGE>
the confidential nature of such Borrower Information and instructed to keep such
Borrower  Information  confidential),  (ii)  to  the  extent  requested  by  any
regulatory  authority or the National  Association  of Insurance  Commissioners,
(iii)  to the  extent  required  by  applicable  laws or  regulations  or by any
subpoena or similar legal  process,  (iv) to any other party to this  Agreement,
(v) in  connection  with the  exercise of any  remedies  hereunder  or any suit,
action or proceeding  relating to this  Agreement or the  enforcement  of rights
hereunder or  thereunder,  (vi) subject to an  agreement  containing  provisions
substantially  the  same as  those  of this  paragraph,  to any  assignee  of or
Participant  in, or any  prospective  assignee of or Participant  in, any of its
rights  or  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or to any  direct  or  indirect
contractual  counterparties  or prospective  contractual  counterparties in swap
agreements or such contractual  counterparties'  professional advisors,  (vi) to
the extent such Borrower  Information (A) is or becomes  generally  available to
the public on a non-confidential  basis through no fault or action by any of the
Lenders or the  Administrative  Agent,  or (B) is or becomes  available  to such
Lenders or the  Administrative  Agent on a  nonconfidential  basis from a source
other than the Borrower and (vii) with the consent of the Borrower.

     SECTION 10.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary,  if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees,  charges and other  amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum  Rate") which may be contracted for,  charged,  taken,
received  or  reserved  by the  Lender  holding  such  Loan in  accordance  with
applicable law, the rate of interest  payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges  payable in respect  thereof,  shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been  payable in  respect  of such Loan but were not  payable as a result of the
operation  of this  Section  shall be  cumulated  and the  interest  and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods  shall be  increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,  together
with  interest  thereon  at the  Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate to the  date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

For purposes of determining  the  Applicable  Margins or the Facility Fee Rates,
(i) as long as the Guarantor is serving as a guarantor,  the Applicable  Margins
and Facility  Fees shall be based on the ratings of the Borrower and  Guarantor,
and the one with the higher ratings shall be applicable,  (ii) in the event that
more than one Level is applicable  due to different  ratings by Moody's and S&P,
then the higher of such ratings shall determine the Applicable  Level,  (iii) if
Moody's  or S&P shall not have in effect a rating  because  such  rating  agency
shall no longer be in the business of rating  corporate debt  obligations,  then
such rating agency will be deemed to have  established a rating one rating level
lower than the rating of either Moody's or S&P, as the case may be, that remains
in effect,  (iv) in the event that the  ratings  are such that no Level shall be
applicable  (other than for the reason set forth in (iii)  above),  then Level 4
shall be deemed  applicable,  (v) the  Applicable  Margins and the  Facility Fee
Rates shall be subject to  adjustment  (upwards or downwards,  as  appropriate),
effective as of the date on which S&P or Moody's announces a rating change which
results in a change in the Applicable Margins and the Facility Fee Rates.


- -----------------------------------
1  Applicable  Utilization  Fee Rate for each  level is only  applicable  if the
aggregate  outstanding  principal amount of all Loans under the Facility exceeds
50% of the total commitments under the Facility.

                                DISCLOSED MATTERS

Existing Litigation

1. On June 9, 2004, a consolidated amended complaint  ("Complaint") was filed in
the  United  States  District  Court  for the  Southern  District  of New  York,
captioned  In Re Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Fee  Litigation,  against  Eaton Vance
Corp. (the "Company"), Eaton Vance Management and Boston Management and Research
(the Company's  investment  management  subsidiaries),  Lloyd George  Investment
Management  (Bermuda)  Limited,  and Orbimed  Advisors  LLC  (collectively,  the
"Investment Advisers"), Eaton Vance, Inc., Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., Lloyd
George Investment  Management (B.V.I.) Limited, nine current or past trustees of
81 Eaton Vance  mutual  funds named as nominal  defendants  (the  "Funds"),  and
twelve  current or past  officers  and  portfolio  managers  of the  Funds.  The
plaintiffs  named in the Complaint are six alleged  shareholders of three of the
81 Funds.  The Complaint,  framed as a class action and as a derivative  suit on
behalf  of the  Funds,  consolidates  and  amends  six  substantially  identical
complaints  previously  brought against most of the named  defendants by the six
plaintiffs.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants improperly used assets of
the Funds to influence  brokers to encourage  sales of Fund shares and failed to
disclose  this  use to  investors.  Based on these  allegations,  the  Complaint
charges that the defendants  violated the Investment Company Act of 1940 and New
York  law  and  breached  their   fiduciary   duties  to  the  Funds  and  their
shareholders,  and that the Investment Advisers violated the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages and rescission by the Funds
of  their  contracts  with  the  Investment   Advisers.   The  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries  believe  that the  Complaint is without  merit and are  vigorously
contesting the lawsuit.

                            ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE


     Reference  is made to the Credit  Agreement,  dated as of December 21, 2004
(as amended,  supplemented or otherwise  modified from time to time, the "Credit
Agreement"), among Eaton Vance Corp. (the "Borrower"), the Lenders party thereto
and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such

defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to
them in the Credit Agreement.

     The  Assignor  identified  on  Schedule l hereto (the  "Assignor")  and the
Assignee identified on Schedule l hereto (the "Assignee") agree as follows:

     i.   The  Assignor  hereby  irrevocably  sells and assigns to the  Assignee
          without recourse to the Assignor,  and the Assignee hereby irrevocably
          purchases  and  assumes  from the  Assignor  without  recourse  to the

          described in Schedule 1 hereto (the "Assigned Interest") in and to the

          amount for each Assigned Facility as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

     ii.  The  Assignor (a) makes no  representation  or warranty and assumes no
          responsibility   with  respect  to  any   statements,   warranties  or

          with respect to the  execution,  legality,  validity,  enforceability,
          genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Credit Agreement or any other
          instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto, other than that the
          Assignor  has not created any adverse  claim upon the  interest  being
          assigned by it hereunder  and that such  interest is free and clear of
          any such adverse claim;  (b) makes no  representation  or warranty and
          assumes no responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition of
          the  Borrower,  any of its  Subsidiaries  or any other  obligor or the
          performance or observance by the Borrower,  any of its Subsidiaries or
          any other  obligor of any of their  respective  obligations  under the
          Credit  Agreement  or  any  other  instrument  or  document  furnished
          pursuant hereto or thereto; and (c) attaches any promissory notes held
          by it  evidencing  the Assigned  Facilities  and (i) requests that the
          Administrative  Agent,  upon  request by the  Assignee,  exchange  the
          attached  promissory  notes for a new promissory note or notes payable
          to the  Assignee and (ii) if the Assignor has retained any interest in
          the Assigned Facility, requests that the Administrative Agent exchange
          the  attached  promissory  notes  for a new  promissory  note or notes

                                      A-1

          Assignment and Acceptance;  (c) agrees that it will, independently and
          without reliance upon the Assignor,  the  Administrative  Agent or any
          other Lender and based on such  documents and  information as it shall
          deem  appropriate  at the  time,  continue  to  make  its  own  credit

          any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto;

          document  furnished pursuant hereto or thereto as are delegated to the
          Administrative  Agent by the terms thereof,  together with such powers
          as are incidental thereto; and (e) agrees that it will be bound by the
          provisions of the Credit Agreement and will perform in accordance with
          its  terms  all the  obligations  which  by the  terms  of the  Credit
          Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender including, if
          it is organized  under the laws of a  jurisdiction  outside the United
          States,  its obligation  pursuant to subsection  2.14(e) of the Credit
          Agreement.

     iv.  The effective  date of this  Assignment  and  Acceptance  shall be the
          Effective  Date of  Assignment  described  in  Schedule 1 hereto  (the
          "Effective  Date").  Following  the execution of this  Assignment  and

          Assigned Interest (including payments of principal, interest, fees and

          make all  appropriate  adjustments  in payments by the  Administrative
          Agent for periods prior to the  Effective  Date or with respect to the
          making of this assignment directly between themselves.
