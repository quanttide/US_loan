the Contracts and such Property Information, as well as having reviewed, or
having had sufficient opportunity to review, the same. By accepting the Deed,
Purchaser acknowledges its receipt and acceptance, or the availability to it,
of all Property Information delivered or made available to it, and that
Purchaser has reviewed the same to its satisfaction. To the extent that the
copies of the Leases, the Contracts and/or the other Property Information
delivered or made available to Purchaser or its attorneys contain provisions
that are, or information that is, inconsistent with any of the foregoing

nonetheless limited to the facts and circumstances or Seller&#146;s knowledge
thereof (as the case may be) existing as of the date of this Agreement.
Without intention to limit the generality of the foregoing in any respect, if
Seller shall receive written notice of any new or additional Violations between
the date hereof and the Closing, Seller shall endeavor promptly to furnish
Purchaser with copies thereof, but Seller&#146;s agreement to do so shall not
change, or detract from, the provision contained in Section&nbsp;7.1(o) that the
representation and warranty relating to Violations set forth therein speaks
only as of the date hereof, nor shall Seller&#146;s failure to furnish copies of any
such notices to Purchaser give rise to any liability on the part of the Seller

Seller shall keep accurate records of all expenses (collectively,

At the Closing, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for all New Lease
Expenses theretofore paid by Seller, if any, except that, if the

shall be amortized over the term thereof, and Seller shall be
responsible for such New Lease Expenses allocable to the period

Closing Date. Seller makes no representations, and assumes no
responsibility (subject, however, to the provisions of Section&nbsp;17.3
below), with respect to the continued occupancy of the Properties or
any part thereof by any Tenant. Subject to the provisions of
Section&nbsp;17.3 below, the vacating of a Tenant prior to the Closing
Date shall not give rise to any claim on the part of Purchaser.
Further, also subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;17.3 below,
Purchaser agrees that it shall not be grounds for Purchaser&#146;s
refusal to close this transaction that any Tenant is a holdover
tenant or in default under its Lease on the Closing Date, and
Purchaser shall accept title subject to such holding over or default
without credit against, or reduction of, the Purchase Price.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>17.4 </B>Seller has further informed Purchaser, and Purchaser further confirms
its understanding, that the Township of Plainsboro currently holds two (2)
standby letters of credit, one in the amount of $32,710.05 and one in the
amount of $395,964.05, that were deposited by Seller to secure a certain two
(2)&nbsp;year maintenance guaranty with regard to certain off-site improvements
related to the Properties and the roadways adjacent to the Properties and an
obligation to complete certain unfinished landscaping on the Properties.
Seller believes that the obligations secured by these letters of credit have
been completely fulfilled and discharged, and that the Township of Plainsboro,
in recognition thereof, will permit such letters of credit to expire by their
terms prior to the Closing Date. If, however, the Township of Plainsboro draws
down either or both of such letters of credit, or demands the replacement
thereof, Seller shall comply in all respects thereby without reimbursement or
contribution by Purchaser. Purchaser shall have no obligation with respect to
the return of these letters of credit, the return of the proceeds thereof if
drawn upon, the posting of new letters of credit in lieu thereof and/or the
performance or completion of the obligations secured thereby. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Purchaser&#146;s Representatives shall
cooperate with Seller in all reasonable respects in connection with the
completion of such work, the maintenance of the appropriate landscaping and
other improvements and the return of the letters of credit and/or the proceeds
thereof. Purchaser shall not be obligated to incur any out-of-pocket cost or
expense in connection with such cooperation, <B><I>provided</I></B>, <B><I>however</I></B>, that, if any

expense, then:

perform its obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Seller&#146;s inability to eliminate Unacceptable Encumbrances as set forth in

may terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller. If Purchaser so elects to
terminate this Agreement, then neither party shall have any further rights,

except that, provided that Purchaser is not otherwise in default hereunder,
Purchaser shall be entitled to the return of the Downpayment. Except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser hereby expressly and
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases any other right or remedy
available to it, at law, in equity, or otherwise, by reason of Seller&#146;s
inability to perform its obligations hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>18.2 </B>In the event of a default hereunder by Purchaser, or if the Closing
fails to occur by reason of Purchaser&#146;s failure or refusal to perform its
obligations hereunder, then Seller may terminate this Agreement by notice to
Purchaser. If Seller so elects to terminate this Agreement, then this
Agreement shall terminate, and Seller&#146;s sole remedy shall be to retain the
Downpayment as liquidated damages for all loss, damage and expenses suffered by
Seller, it being agreed that Seller&#146;s damages are impossible to ascertain.
Following such termination, neither party shall have any further rights,
obligations, or liabilities hereunder, except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>18.3 </B>If the Closing fails to occur by reason of Seller&#146;s willful and

commence such an action within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the occurrence of such
default. Purchaser&#146;s failure timely to commence such an action for specific
performance within such sixty (60)&nbsp;day period, with time of the essence, shall
be deemed a waiver by it of its right to commence such an action. If Purchaser
shall timely commence and diligently prosecute such action for specific
performance, but, for any reason other than Purchaser&#146;s failure or neglect
diligently to prosecute such action in accordance with applicable law, the
court having jurisdiction of such action shall enter a final judgment, the
effect of which shall be to refuse to grant specific performance to Purchaser,
then Seller agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>21.16 </B>For the purposes only of effectuating a 1031 exchange as
contemplated in Section&nbsp;21.15, Purchaser may assign this Agreement one time
only to a Purchaser&#146;s Affiliate or to a third party qualified intermediary,
<B><I>provided</I></B>, <B><I>however</I></B>, that such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser from any of
Purchaser&#146;s obligations under this Agreement or result in a delay of the
Closing. Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of Section&nbsp;21.3,
such assignment shall not require the consent of Seller, but shall not be
effective unless and until a copy of the instrument of assignment, together
with an agreement of the assignee assuming all of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement to be performed by Purchaser, in form reasonably satisfactory to
Seller&#146;s counsel, shall be delivered to Seller&#146;s counsel. For the purposes
hereof, &#147;<B><I>Purchaser&#146;s Affiliate</I></B>&#148; shall mean any entity that has one hundred
(100%) percent of the same direct or indirect ownership as Purchaser. Except
for the first two (2)&nbsp;sentences thereof, all of the provisions of Section&nbsp;21.3
shall apply to such an assignment. The representations and warranties made by
Purchaser in Section&nbsp;7.8 shall be deemed to be made with respect to such
assignee by both Purchaser and such assignee both as of the date of such
assignment and as of the Closing Date.
