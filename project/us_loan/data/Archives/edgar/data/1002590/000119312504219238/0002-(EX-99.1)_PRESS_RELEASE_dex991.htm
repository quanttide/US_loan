(December 17, 2004) &#151; Star Gas Partners, L.P. (the &#147;Partnership&#148; or &#147;Star&#148;) (NYSE: SGU, SGH), a diversified home energy distributor and services provider specializing in heating oil and propane, today announced the
completion of the sale of its propane business and the execution of a new revolving credit facility for its heating oil segment. The Partnership believes that its recent liquidity crisis has ended as a result of the successful completion of these
two transactions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On December 17, 2004, the Partnership completed the
previously announced sale of its propane segment, held largely through Star Gas Propane, L.P., to Inergy Propane LLC (&#147;Inergy&#148;), the operating subsidiary of Inergy, L.P., (NASDAQ: NRGY), for a purchase price of $475 million, subject to
certain adjustments. The Partnership expects to recognize a gain in excess of $150 million from the sale of the propane segment. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">$311 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the propane segment were used to repurchase the senior secured notes and first mortgage notes of the heating oil segment
and propane segment, to repay amounts outstanding under the propane segment&#146;s working capital facilities. The Partnership expects to recognize a loss of approximately $43 million on the early redemption of the senior secured notes and first
mortgage notes of the heating oil segment and propane segment. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In accordance
with the terms of the indenture relating to the Partnership&#146;s 10<FONT SIZE="1"><SUP>&nbsp;1</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="2">/</FONT><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">% Senior Notes (&#147;MLP Notes&#148;),
the Partnership is obligated, within 360 days of the sale, to apply the remaining net proceeds of the sale of the propane segment either to reduce indebtedness (and reduce any related commitment) of the Partnership or of a restricted subsidiary, or
to make an investment in assets or capital expenditures useful to the Partnership&#146;s or any subsidiary&#146;s business. To the extent any net proceeds that are not so applied exceed $10 million (&#147;excess proceeds&#148;), the indenture
requires the Partnership to make an offer to all holders of MLP Notes to purchase for cash that number of MLP Notes that may be purchased with excess proceeds at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the MLP Notes plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The Partnership cannot determine the amount of excess proceeds that will result from the sale of the propane segment. Accordingly, the Partnership cannot predict the size of any offer to purchase the MLP
Notes and whether or to what extent holders of MLP Notes will accept the offer to purchase when made. </FONT></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"
