FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


                     AN UNEXPECTED CHRISTMAS PRESENT ARRIVES

                 J.K. ROWLING'S HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD
                 PRINCE TO BE PUBLISHED ON JULY 16, 2005 IN THE
                  UNITED STATES, BRITAIN, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA


NEW YORK, NY: LONDON, ENGLAND: December 21, 2004 - HARRY POTTER AND THE
HALF-BLOOD PRINCE by J.K. Rowling, the sixth in the best-selling series, has
been scheduled for release on July 16, 2005 in the United States, Britain,
Canada and Australia, it was announced today by Scholastic and Bloomsbury, her
publishers. On her website, www.jkrowling.com, J.K. Rowling announced yesterday
that she had delivered the manuscript to her publishers.

In making the joint announcement, Barbara Marcus, President of Scholastic
Children's Books in the United States, and Nigel Newton, Chief Executive of
Bloomsbury Publishing in Britain, said, "We are delighted to announce the
publication date. J.K. Rowling has written a brilliant story that will dazzle
her fans in a marvelous book that takes the series to yet greater heights. HARRY
POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE delivers all the excitement and wonder of her
best-selling previous Harry Potter novels."

In the fifth and most recent book, HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX,
the last chapter, titled "The Second War Begins," started:

         'In a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge
         confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned to this country
         and is active once more.

         "It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling
         himself Lord - well, you know who I mean - is alive among us again,"
         said Fudge.'

HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE takes up the story of Harry Potter's
sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at this point in the
midst of the storm of this battle of good and evil.

The author has already said that the Half-Blood Prince is neither Harry nor
Voldemort. And most importantly, the opening chapter of HARRY POTTER AND THE
HALF-BLOOD PRINCE has been brewing in J.K. Rowling's mind for 13 years.

HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, J.K. Rowling's fifth Harry Potter
book, was released on June 21, 2003, and was the fastest-selling book in history
on the first weekend of its publication. All five Harry Potter books, HARRY
POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, HARRY
POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, as well
as HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, have been number one bestsellers
in the United States, Britain, and around the world.

Scholastic will publish HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE in hardcover
under the Arthur A. Levine imprint with interior and cover art by Mary Grand
Pre, who has illustrated the previous five books. The price will be $29.99.
