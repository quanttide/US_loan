<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Item&nbsp;1.01. <U>Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, LCC United Kingdom Limited (&#147;Limited&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of LCC
International, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), entered into a Consulting Agreement (the &#147;Consulting
Agreement&#148;) with SEMAB Management Srl (&#147;SEMAB&#148;), a private limited company controlled by Carlo
Baravalle. Concurrently therewith, Carlo Baravalle and Limited entered into a letter agreement
(the &#147;Side Letter Agreement&#148;) and compromise agreement (the &#147;Compromise Agreement&#148;). SEMAB and
Limited entered into a letter agreement (the &#147;Appointment Letter Agreement&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As further described below, the agreements collectively provide that Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle&#146;s employment
relationship with Limited is terminated, and that he will continue to provide services to Limited
as a consultant through SEMAB.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the Compromise Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle and Limited have agreed that Mr.
Baravalle&#146;s employment with Limited is terminated in all respects, and Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle has released
Limited from any possible claims arising out of or relating to his service as an employee of
Limited and from his employment contract with Limited in consideration for the arrangements
contained in the Consulting Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the Consulting Agreement, SEMAB has agreed that a consultant (the &#147;Consultant&#148;),
mutually agreeable to SEMAB and Limited, will provide services as a senior vice president of the
Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to Limited on a full-time independent
contractor basis. The Appointment Letter Agreement provides that Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle is appointed by
SEBAB and accepted by Limited as the Consultant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Consulting Agreement anticipates that the Consultant will be required to travel frequently,
both inside and outside the United Kingdom and Italy, in connection with the provision of these
services. Limited has agreed to pay SEMAB an annual service fee of <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>420,000 (less any fees paid to
the Consultant for service on any board of directors of Limited, the Company or their affiliates)
in consideration of these services, as well as a commencement fee of 114,726 Euros. In addition,
Limited may, in its discretion, pay SEMAB an annual performance incentive bonus based on Limited&#146;s
assessment of SEMAB&#146;s contractual performance during the prior year against various objectives that
may include the achievement of revenue, profit and other objectives for Limited, the Company and
their affiliates in the Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions. SEMAB will be
eligible to receive a bonus of up to <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>150,000 for services rendered from the date of the Consulting
Agreement to December&nbsp;31, 2004, the actual amount of which bonus will be based on the extent to
which the 2004 goals of Limited in the Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are
achieved for the fourth quarter of 2004. SEMAB&#146;s incentive bonus for services rendered
after December&nbsp;31, 2004 will be comparable to those additional incentives or bonus programs
generally provided to officers, at the senior vice president level, of Limited in the relevant year
by the board of directors of the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Consultant will be entitled, subject to the provisions of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated
Equity Incentive Plan, to receive stock options under such plan as may be determined advisable by,
and approved by, the compensation committee of the Company&#146;s board of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">directors. Limited has also agreed to reimburse SEMAB for certain out-of-pocket business expenses
in connection with the performance of the Consultant&#146;s services. The Consulting Agreement also
contains other related indemnification, non-circumvention, non-solicitation, non-competition,
proprietary rights and confidentiality provisions.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Consulting Agreement has an initial term of five years, and may be renewed by either party upon
twelve months written notice prior to the agreement&#146;s expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Consulting Agreement may be terminated by Limited or SEMAB at any time, for any reason, upon
twelve months written notice. Limited may terminate the agreement without providing a full twelve
months notice if it makes specified termination payments to SEMAB compensating it for the remainder
of the service period in question. Limited may also terminate the agreement without notice and
without payment of compensation in the event of specified negative conduct by SEBAB or the
Consultant related to their performance under the agreement. The agreement also contains other
termination provisions relating to changes of control of the Company, uncured payment defaults by
Limited, reductions in SEMAB&#146;s status or a reduction in fees without SEMAB&#146;s consent.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the Side Letter Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle has agreed that he will serve as the
Consultant, and has agreed to be bound by, and guarantee SEMAB&#146;s performance of, certain of the
Side Letter Agreement&#146;s provisions relating to indemnification, non-circumvention,
non-solicitation, non-competition, proprietary rights, confidentiality and other matters.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the LCC International, Inc. Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, options
granted to Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle will remain in effect in accordance with their original terms for so long
as Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle continues to provide services to the Company as a consultant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Consulting Agreement,
the Compromise Agreement, the Appointment Letter Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement, which are
filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;10.01.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">This CONSULTING AGREEMENT (this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made and entered into as of 23
December&nbsp;2004 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) by and between LCC UK Limited, with a
registered office of 91-93 Baker Street, London, W1U 6QQ, United Kingdom
(&#147;LCC&#148;), and SEMAB Management Srl, with a registered office of Corso
Inghilterra 31, 10138, Torino, Italy (the &#147;Supplier&#148;).


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, Supplier desires to provide certain consulting services to LCC and its
Associated Companies (as defined in Section&nbsp;3.3 below) as described herein; and


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">WHEREAS, LCC desires to receive the services of Supplier and, in order to
receive the same, has consented to engaging Supplier to provide the services of
a mutually acceptable consultant (&#147;Supplier Employee&#148;) for the benefit of LCC
and its Associated Companies (as defined in Section&nbsp;3.3 below) in the EMEA
region.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the forgoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">1.1 <U>Engagement of Supplier; Scope of Services</U>. LCC hereby engages
Supplier as an independent Supplier to perform the Services (the &#147;Services&#148;)

engagement. The parties acknowledge that Supplier&#146;s Employee will be expected
to provide services with respect to LCC&#146;s and its Associated Companies&#146;
business throughout the EMEA region including, without limitation, Associated
Companies in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, The Netherlands, Spain,

devote a substantial portion of his time, energy and attention to LCC&#146;s
operations in countries other than Italy.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">1.2 <U>Employment Matters</U>. Except as provided herein, Supplier
acknowledges and agrees that it and its employees shall not receive any
employee benefits of any kind from LCC. Supplier and its employees are
excluded from participating in any fringe benefit plans or programs as a result
of the performance of services under this Agreement, without regard to
Supplier&#146;s independent contractor status. In addition, Supplier waives (i)&nbsp;any
and all rights, if any, to participation in any of LCC&#146;s fringe benefit plans
or programs including, but not limited to, health, sickness, accident or dental
coverage, life insurance, disability benefits, severance, accidental death and
dismemberment coverage, unemployment insurance coverage, workers&#146; compensation
coverage, and pension provided by LCC to its employees, and (ii)&nbsp;any and all
claims arising out of or in connection with any claim that Supplier or
Supplier&#146;s Employee is or should be entitled to any payments, benefits or
contributions as an employee of LCC or any Associated Company. Supplier shall
make all required payments related to its personnel, including, but not limited
to, social security and income tax payments for Supplier&#146;s Employee (as defined
in Exhibit&nbsp;A).


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">2. <U>COMPENSATION</U>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">2.1 <U>Service Fees</U>. In consideration of Supplier&#146;s performance of the
Services, LCC hereby agrees to pay Supplier the service fees set forth in
Exhibit&nbsp;B attached hereto (&#147;Service Fees&#148;). Supplier hereby agrees to provide

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Supplier shall perform the following Services for LCC:


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Supplier shall appoint an individual to provide the Services to LCC and,
provided the individual is acceptable to LCC in its sole discretion, LCC will
accept the appointment in writing (&#147;Supplier&#146;s Employee&#148;). Neither LCC nor
Supplier will be entitled to appoint any other individual without the written
consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld in the sole and
absolute discretion of such party. Supplier&#146;s Employee shall provide the
services of a Senior Vice President of the Europe, Middle-East, Africa &#038;
Asia-Pacific regions. Supplier&#146;s Employee will report to the Chief Executive
Officer of LCC&#146;s parent company, LCC International, Inc. Supplier&#146;s Employee
will additionally provide other services requested by LCC which are within
Supplier&#146;s Employee&#146;s skill and competence and appropriate to the foregoing
position. Supplier shall provide these services on a full-time basis,
provided, however, that Supplier&#146;s Employee shall be entitled to take, and be
paid for, 25&nbsp;days holiday per year in addition to all Bank holidays in his
country of residence. Holidays must be taken at times convenient to and agreed
in writing by LCC and reasonable notice of Supplier&#146;s Employee&#146;s intention to
take holiday must be given to Supplier Employee&#146;s manager who will then confirm
whether the dates are acceptable. No single period of leave may exceed ten
working days without the express written consent of Supplier Employee&#146;s
manager.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Supplier&#146;s Employee will be required to travel on the business of LCC to such
places as may be reasonably necessary for the proper performance of the
Services, both inside and outside the UK or Italy. It is anticipated that such
travel, particularly to destinations outside of Italy, will be on a frequent
and regular basis. Supplier&#146;s Employee will provide services during the normal
business hours, provided, however, that Supplier may be required to work
additional hours to meet the need of LCC&#146;s business and Supplier will not be
paid additional amounts for such additional hours.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">LCC shall have the right to make reasonable changes to the scope, type and
description of services provided by Supplier or Supplier&#146;s Employee under this
Agreement given, among other things, LCC&#146;s organizational or business
requirements as they may now exist or as they may evolve in the future,
provided, however, that Supplier&#146;s prior consent shall be required for any
change that will result in either (a)&nbsp;a material reduction of Supplier&#146;s status
or responsibilities below the level of a Senior Vice President within LCC or
within comparable companies, or (b)&nbsp;a reduction of Supplier&#146;s Monthly Fees
payable hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, Supplier shall fully cooperate
with LCC in developing and implementing any organizational, structural or
business changes that LCC, its parent company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer or its
Board of Directors may deem appropriate, necessary, desirable or advisable
given LCC&#146;s organizational and/or business requirements in the EMEA region.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Service Fees and Additional Incentives</U></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Service Fees</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In consideration for the Services provided by Supplier, LCC agrees to pay
Supplier at the rate set forth below:


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Annual Service Fee: &#128;420,000, payable on a monthly basis in installments of
&#128;35,000 on or before the 28<SUP>th</SUP> day of each month during the term hereof,
provided, however, that payments for any partial months will be prorated based
on the number of days worked in the relevant month. Any amounts paid to
Supplier or Supplier&#146;s Employee for service on any one or more board of
directors of LCC&#146;s Associated Companies shall be deducted from the next monthly
payment of the Monthly Service Fee due Supplier under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The parties may, but shall not be required to, review the Annual Services Fees
payable hereunder for any possible or mutually acceptable adjustments that may
be advisable given changed circumstances.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Within five (5)&nbsp;days after execution of this Agreement, LCC shall pay Supplier
a commencement fee of Euro
114,726. Such fee includes Service Fees for the month of December 2004.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the event Supplier&#146;s Employee is unable to serve hereunder due to its
disability, as certified to LCC&#146;s satisfaction by a medical professional
acceptable to LCC, then (A)&nbsp;LCC shall continue to pay Supplier&#146;s Service Fees
due hereunder for a period of thirteen (13)&nbsp;weeks from the date the disability
commences, (B)&nbsp;after the expiration of such thirteen (13)&nbsp;week period, and for
so long as the period of disability continues (the &#147;Period of Suspension&#148;),
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, provided, however that
Supplier&#146;s Employee shall not be required to provide services hereunder, and
LCC shall not be obligated to make any payments of services fees or otherwise
hereunder, and no such payments shall accrue for the Period of Suspension, and
(C)&nbsp;in the event Supplier&#146;s Employee is able to recommence services hereunder,
as certified to LCC&#146;s satisfaction by a medical professional acceptable to LCC,
then Supplier shall provide written notice thereof to LCC and, upon LCC&#146;s
receipt of such notice and such medical certification, the Period of Suspension
shall terminate, Supplier&#146;s Employee shall resume providing services hereunder,
and LCC shall resume the payment of fees hereunder. In the event any Period of
Suspension exceeds twelve (12)&nbsp;months, inclusive of the thirteen (13)&nbsp;week
period described above, LCC shall have the right at anytime thereafter to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;6.2.4.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Additional Incentives</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Performance Incentive: LCC will evaluate Supplier&#146;s performance hereunder on
not less than an annual basis and may, but shall not be required to, pay
Supplier a performance incentive bonus on or about March&nbsp;15 of each year during
the term hereof based upon LCC&#146;s assessment of Supplier&#146;s performance during
the prior year against various objectives that may include the achievement of
revenue, profit and other objectives for LCC and its Affiliate Companies in the
EMEA region. For Services rendered from the date of this contract to 31
December&nbsp;2004, Supplier will be eligible to receive a bonus of up to
&#128;150,000, the actual amount will be based on the extent to which EMEA and
LCC 2004 goals are achieved for the fourth quarter of 2004. In respect of
services rendered after 31 December&nbsp;2004, Supplier&#146;s Performance Incentives
will be comparable to those additional incentives or bonus programs generally
provided for officers, at the Senior Vice President level, of LCC for the
relevant year by the Board of Directors of LCC&#146;s parent company, LCC
International, Inc. The payment of any performance incentive shall be within
LCC&#146;s discretion. No bonus is due if, prior to the payment date, Supplier has
served notice of termination of this agreement (other than under Sections
6.2.3(b) or 6.2.3(c)) or has been served notice of termination by LCC, except
as otherwise provided in Article&nbsp;6 hereof.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Options: Supplier&#146;s Employee shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of
the Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan adopted by LCC&#146;s parent company,
to receive stock options under such plan as may be determined advisable by, and
approved by, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Materials</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Supplier will be provided use of a laptop, printer, datacard, mobile phone and
an LCC e-mail account on such terms as LCC may provide.
