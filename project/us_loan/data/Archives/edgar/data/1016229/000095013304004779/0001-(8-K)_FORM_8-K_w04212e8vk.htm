<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Item&nbsp;1.01. <U>Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, LCC United Kingdom Limited (&#147;Limited&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of LCC
International, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), entered into a Consulting Agreement (the &#147;Consulting
Agreement&#148;) with SEMAB Management Srl (&#147;SEMAB&#148;), a private limited company controlled by Carlo
Baravalle. Concurrently therewith, Carlo Baravalle and Limited entered into a letter agreement
(the &#147;Side Letter Agreement&#148;) and compromise agreement (the &#147;Compromise Agreement&#148;). SEMAB and
Limited entered into a letter agreement (the &#147;Appointment Letter Agreement&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As further described below, the agreements collectively provide that Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle&#146;s employment
relationship with Limited is terminated, and that he will continue to provide services to Limited
as a consultant through SEMAB.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the Compromise Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle and Limited have agreed that Mr.
Baravalle&#146;s employment with Limited is terminated in all respects, and Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle has released
Limited from any possible claims arising out of or relating to his service as an employee of
Limited and from his employment contract with Limited in consideration for the arrangements
contained in the Consulting Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the Consulting Agreement, SEMAB has agreed that a consultant (the &#147;Consultant&#148;),
mutually agreeable to SEMAB and Limited, will provide services as a senior vice president of the
Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to Limited on a full-time independent
contractor basis. The Appointment Letter Agreement provides that Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle is appointed by
SEBAB and accepted by Limited as the Consultant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Consulting Agreement anticipates that the Consultant will be required to travel frequently,
both inside and outside the United Kingdom and Italy, in connection with the provision of these
services. Limited has agreed to pay SEMAB an annual service fee of <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>420,000 (less any fees paid to
the Consultant for service on any board of directors of Limited, the Company or their affiliates)
in consideration of these services, as well as a commencement fee of 114,726 Euros. In addition,
Limited may, in its discretion, pay SEMAB an annual performance incentive bonus based on Limited&#146;s
assessment of SEMAB&#146;s contractual performance during the prior year against various objectives that
may include the achievement of revenue, profit and other objectives for Limited, the Company and
their affiliates in the Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions. SEMAB will be
eligible to receive a bonus of up to <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>150,000 for services rendered from the date of the Consulting
Agreement to December&nbsp;31, 2004, the actual amount of which bonus will be based on the extent to
which the 2004 goals of Limited in the Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are
achieved for the fourth quarter of 2004. SEMAB&#146;s incentive bonus for services rendered
after December&nbsp;31, 2004 will be comparable to those additional incentives or bonus programs
generally provided to officers, at the senior vice president level, of Limited in the relevant year
by the board of directors of the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Consultant will be entitled, subject to the provisions of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated
Equity Incentive Plan, to receive stock options under such plan as may be determined advisable by,
and approved by, the compensation committee of the Company&#146;s board of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">directors. Limited has also agreed to reimburse SEMAB for certain out-of-pocket business expenses
in connection with the performance of the Consultant&#146;s services. The Consulting Agreement also
contains other related indemnification, non-circumvention, non-solicitation, non-competition,
proprietary rights and confidentiality provisions.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Consulting Agreement has an initial term of five years, and may be renewed by either party upon
twelve months written notice prior to the agreement&#146;s expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Consulting Agreement may be terminated by Limited or SEMAB at any time, for any reason, upon
twelve months written notice. Limited may terminate the agreement without providing a full twelve
months notice if it makes specified termination payments to SEMAB compensating it for the remainder
of the service period in question. Limited may also terminate the agreement without notice and
without payment of compensation in the event of specified negative conduct by SEBAB or the
Consultant related to their performance under the agreement. The agreement also contains other
termination provisions relating to changes of control of the Company, uncured payment defaults by
Limited, reductions in SEMAB&#146;s status or a reduction in fees without SEMAB&#146;s consent.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the Side Letter Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle has agreed that he will serve as the
Consultant, and has agreed to be bound by, and guarantee SEMAB&#146;s performance of, certain of the
Side Letter Agreement&#146;s provisions relating to indemnification, non-circumvention,
non-solicitation, non-competition, proprietary rights, confidentiality and other matters.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the LCC International, Inc. Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, options
granted to Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle will remain in effect in accordance with their original terms for so long
as Mr.&nbsp;Baravalle continues to provide services to the Company as a consultant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Consulting Agreement,
the Compromise Agreement, the Appointment Letter Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement, which are
filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;10.01.
