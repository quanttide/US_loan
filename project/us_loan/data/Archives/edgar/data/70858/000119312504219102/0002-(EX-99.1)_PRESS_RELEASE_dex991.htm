for this company for the past 38 years, to lead BankBoston and Fleet through important mergers and dramatic growth, and to serve as chairman through our most recent merger,&#148; said Gifford. &#147;I couldn&#146;t be more proud of the company and
the commitment of our leadership team to building the company for the benefit of all our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, associates and communities. We have accomplished our transition objectives much faster than I expected, and
I am confident in the company&#146;s bright future under Ken&#146;s leadership.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
