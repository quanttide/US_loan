          STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN
           ORDER OF ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL MONEY PENALTY
          ---------------------------------------------

     This Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order of
Assessment of Civil Money Penalty (Stipulation), which concerns
the accompanying and above-referenced Order of Assessment of
Civil Money Penalty (Order), is submitted by AnchorBank, fsb,
Madison, Wisconsin (Bank), OTS Docket No. 04474, to the Office of
Thrift Supervision (OTS), which is acting through the OTS Midwest
Regional Director (Regional Director).

     WHEREAS, OTS, based upon information derived from the
exercise of its regulatory responsibilities, is of the opinion
that grounds exist to initiate an administrative proceeding
against the Bank, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(i)(1), and

     WHEREAS, the Bank desires to cooperate with OTS and to avoid
the time and expense of such administrative proceeding and,
without any adjudication on the merits, and without admitting or
denying that such grounds exist, or the Findings of Fact or
opinions and conclusions of OTS, except as to Jurisdiction,
Paragraph 1, below, which is admitted, hereby stipulates and
agrees to the following:

1.   Jurisdiction
     ------------

     A. The Bank is a "savings association" within the meaning of 12
        U.S.C. Section 1813(b), and 12 U.S.C. Section 1462(4).  Accordingly,
        it is an "insured depository institution" as that term is defined in
        12 U.S.C. Section 1813(c).

     B. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1813(q), the Director of the OTS is
        the "appropriate Federal banking agency" to maintain an
        administrative civil money penalty assessment proceeding against
        such savings association.  Therefore, the Bank is subject to the
        jurisdiction of OTS to initiate and maintain administrative
        proceedings against it pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(i).
        The Deputy Director of OTS, pursuant to delegated authority
_______________________________
(1)  All references to the United States Code (U.S.C.) are as
     amended, unless otherwise indicated.

        from the Director of OTS, has delegated to the OTS Midwest Regional
        Director (Regional Director) the authority to issue orders of
        assessment of civil money penalty where the savings association
        has consented to the issuance of the orders.

2.   OTS Findings of Fact
     --------------------

     A. Based on the Report of Examination of the Bank (ROE) as of
        May 3, 2004, OTS finds that the Bank violated several regulations
        adopted to implement the Currency and Foreign Transactions
        Reporting Act, as amended by the USA Patriot Act and other laws
        (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), 31 U.S.C.
        Sections 5311 et seq.  These violations include, but are not
        limited to, violations of:

         1.  31 C.F.R. Sections 103.22(b)(1) and 103.22(c)(1) and (c)(2)
             (filing of report of transactions in currency (CTRs));

         2.  31 C.F.R. Section 103.27 (filing of CTRs within the required 15
             days, filing CTRs with all required information, and failure to
             maintain copies of corrected CTRs);

         3.  12 C.F.R. Section 103.29 (completion of cash sales of monetary
             instruments documentation);

         4.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(b)(2) and 31 C.F.R. Section 103.121(b)
             (implementation of customer identification program (CIP) and
             incorporation of CIP program into the Bank's anti-money
             laundering program);

         5.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(1) and 12 C.F.R. Part 570, Appendix
             A, Section II.A (maintenance of a system of internal controls to
             ensure ongoing compliance);

         6.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(2) (independent testing);

         7.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(3) (designation of BSA officer who
             could coordinate and monitor day-to-day compliance with BSA); and

         8.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(4) (training of appropriate
             personnel).

     B.  Based on the May 3, 2004 ROE, OTS finds that the Bank violated 12
         C.F.R. Section 563.180(d) (filing suspicious activity reports timely).

     C.  The Bank's violations of 31 C.F.R. Sections 103.27(a)(3), 103.27(d),
         and 12 C.F.R. Section 563.180(d)(5) are repeat violations noted in a
         prior examination.

6.   Scope of Release; Other Governmental Actions Not Affected
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     A.  Upon OTS's issuance of the accompanying Order, following
         OTS's acceptance of this Stipulation by the Bank and due to the
         issuance of Consent Order to Cease and Desist for Affirmative
         Relief against the Bank (OTS Order No. MWR-04-16, dated September
         17, 2004), OTS does release and discharge the Bank from all

         Findings of Fact set forth in Paragraph 2 of this Stipulation to
         the extent known to OTS as of the effective date of the
         accompanying Order.  However, the violations alleged above in
         Paragraph 2 of this Stipulation may be utilized by OTS in future
         enforcement actions against the Bank to establish a pattern or
         practice of violations, the continuation of a pattern or practice
         or history of violations, repeat violations, or a history of
         program deficiencies. This release shall not preclude or affect
         any right of OTS to determine and ensure compliance with the
         terms and provisions of this Stipulation and the accompanying
         Order.
