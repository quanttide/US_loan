Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          ------------------------------------------

     On December 20, 2004 the Board of Directors of AnchorBank, fsb, (the
"Bank") a wholly owned subsidiary of Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. (the
"Corporation"),  entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an
Order of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty with the Office of Thrift
Supervision ("OTS") and the OTS issued a Consent Order of Assessment of Civil
Money Penalty ("Consent Order"), copies of which are attached hereto as
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively. Under the Consent Order, the Bank's
board of directors agreed to the assessment of a civil money penalty in the
amount of $100,000 against the Bank in connection with the same matters
addressed in the consent cease and desist order previously issued by the OTS.
The previous consent order was issued to the Bank in September 2004 in
connection with alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") and related
regulations. Under the previous consent order, the Bank's board agreed, among
other things, to take a range of actions with respect to the review and
conduct of its BSA compliance activities. The Bank remains subject to the
possibility of additional governmental actions with regard to these matters,
including potential additional monetary penalties.
