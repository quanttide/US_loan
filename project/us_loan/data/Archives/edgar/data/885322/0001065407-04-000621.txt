          STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN
           ORDER OF ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL MONEY PENALTY
          ---------------------------------------------

     This Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order of
Assessment of Civil Money Penalty (Stipulation), which concerns
the accompanying and above-referenced Order of Assessment of
Civil Money Penalty (Order), is submitted by AnchorBank, fsb,
Madison, Wisconsin (Bank), OTS Docket No. 04474, to the Office of
Thrift Supervision (OTS), which is acting through the OTS Midwest
Regional Director (Regional Director).

     WHEREAS, OTS, based upon information derived from the
exercise of its regulatory responsibilities, is of the opinion
that grounds exist to initiate an administrative proceeding
against the Bank, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(i)(1), and

     WHEREAS, the Bank desires to cooperate with OTS and to avoid
the time and expense of such administrative proceeding and,
without any adjudication on the merits, and without admitting or
denying that such grounds exist, or the Findings of Fact or
opinions and conclusions of OTS, except as to Jurisdiction,
Paragraph 1, below, which is admitted, hereby stipulates and
agrees to the following:

1.   Jurisdiction
     ------------

     A. The Bank is a "savings association" within the meaning of 12
        U.S.C. Section 1813(b), and 12 U.S.C. Section 1462(4).  Accordingly,
        it is an "insured depository institution" as that term is defined in
        12 U.S.C. Section 1813(c).

     B. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1813(q), the Director of the OTS is
        the "appropriate Federal banking agency" to maintain an
        administrative civil money penalty assessment proceeding against
        such savings association.  Therefore, the Bank is subject to the
        jurisdiction of OTS to initiate and maintain administrative
        proceedings against it pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(i).
        The Deputy Director of OTS, pursuant to delegated authority
_______________________________
(1)  All references to the United States Code (U.S.C.) are as
     amended, unless otherwise indicated.

        from the Director of OTS, has delegated to the OTS Midwest Regional
        Director (Regional Director) the authority to issue orders of
        assessment of civil money penalty where the savings association
        has consented to the issuance of the orders.

2.   OTS Findings of Fact
     --------------------

     A. Based on the Report of Examination of the Bank (ROE) as of
        May 3, 2004, OTS finds that the Bank violated several regulations
        adopted to implement the Currency and Foreign Transactions
        Reporting Act, as amended by the USA Patriot Act and other laws
        (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), 31 U.S.C.
        Sections 5311 et seq.  These violations include, but are not
        limited to, violations of:

         1.  31 C.F.R. Sections 103.22(b)(1) and 103.22(c)(1) and (c)(2)
             (filing of report of transactions in currency (CTRs));

         2.  31 C.F.R. Section 103.27 (filing of CTRs within the required 15
             days, filing CTRs with all required information, and failure to
             maintain copies of corrected CTRs);

         3.  12 C.F.R. Section 103.29 (completion of cash sales of monetary
             instruments documentation);

         4.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(b)(2) and 31 C.F.R. Section 103.121(b)
             (implementation of customer identification program (CIP) and
             incorporation of CIP program into the Bank's anti-money
             laundering program);

         5.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(1) and 12 C.F.R. Part 570, Appendix
             A, Section II.A (maintenance of a system of internal controls to
             ensure ongoing compliance);

         6.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(2) (independent testing);

         7.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(3) (designation of BSA officer who
             could coordinate and monitor day-to-day compliance with BSA); and

         8.  12 C.F.R. Section 563.177(c)(4) (training of appropriate
             personnel).

     B.  Based on the May 3, 2004 ROE, OTS finds that the Bank violated 12
         C.F.R. Section 563.180(d) (filing suspicious activity reports timely).

     C.  The Bank's violations of 31 C.F.R. Sections 103.27(a)(3), 103.27(d),
         and 12 C.F.R. Section 563.180(d)(5) are repeat violations noted in a
         prior examination.

3.   Consent
     -------

     The Bank consents to the issuance by OTS of the accompanying
     Order.  It further agrees to comply with the terms of the
     Order upon issuance and stipulates that the Order complies
     with all requirements of law.

5.   Waivers
     -------

     The Bank waives the following:

         against it as provided by 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(i);

         against it as provided by 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(i);

         without limitation, any such right provided by 12 U.S.C.
         Section 1818(h), or otherwise to challenge the validity of
         the Order;

     D.  Any and all claims against OTS, including its employees and
         agents, and any other governmental entity for the award of fees,
         costs, or expenses related to this OTS enforcement matter and/or
         the Order, whether arising under common law, the Equal Access to
         Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 504, or 28 U.S.C. Section 2412; and

     E.  The right to assert this proceeding, its consent to the
         issuance of the Order, the issuance of the Order, the payment of
         any monies or the provision of any other financial relief as
         contemplated by the Order as the basis for a claim of double
         jeopardy in any pending or future proceeding brought by the
         United States Department of Justice or any other governmental
         entity.

6.   Scope of Release; Other Governmental Actions Not Affected
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     A.  Upon OTS's issuance of the accompanying Order, following
         OTS's acceptance of this Stipulation by the Bank and due to the
         issuance of Consent Order to Cease and Desist for Affirmative
         Relief against the Bank (OTS Order No. MWR-04-16, dated September
         17, 2004), OTS does release and discharge the Bank from all
         potential claims and charges that have been or might have been
         asserted by OTS, based on the alleged violations described in OTS
         Findings of Fact set forth in Paragraph 2 of this Stipulation to
         the extent known to OTS as of the effective date of the
         accompanying Order.  However, the violations alleged above in
         Paragraph 2 of this Stipulation may be utilized by OTS in future
         enforcement actions against the Bank to establish a pattern or
         practice of violations, the continuation of a pattern or practice
         or history of violations, repeat violations, or a history of
         program deficiencies. This release shall not preclude or affect
         any right of OTS to determine and ensure compliance with the
         terms and provisions of this Stipulation and the accompanying
         Order.

CMP Stipulation


     B.  The Bank acknowledges and agrees that its consent to the
         issuance of the accompanying Order (1) is for the purpose of
         resolving this OTS enforcement matter only, as set forth in
         Paragraph 2, OTS Findings of Fact, hereof  and provided for
         in Paragraph 6A above and (2) otherwise does not release,
         discharge, compromise, settle, dismiss, resolve, or in any
         way affect any actions, charges against, liability, or other
         administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding that arise
         pursuant to this action or otherwise, and that may be or has
         been brought by another governmental entity.  Further, the
         issuance of this Order does not release, discharge,
         compromise, settle, dismiss, resolve, or in any way affect
         any actions, charges against or other proceeding, civil or
         criminal, that may be or has been brought by OTS or any
         other governmental entity against any institution-affiliated
         party of the Bank.

7.   Miscellaneous

     A.  The construction and validity of this Stipulation and the
         Order shall be governed by the laws of the United States of
         America.

     B.  In case any provision of the Stipulation or Order is ruled

         enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
         any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the Regional
