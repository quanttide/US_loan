              PENN TRAFFIC FILES AMENDED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND
           DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ANNOUNCING SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTION


                  SYRACUSE, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 23, 2004 - The Penn Traffic
Company (OTC: PNFTQ.PK) today filed its First Amended Plan of Reorganization and
Disclosure Statement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York, which describes its intention to consummate a sale-leaseback
transaction with respect to its distribution centers upon emergence from chapter
11. Under the sale-leaseback transaction, Penn Traffic will sell five of its
owned distribution centers located in New York and Pennsylvania to Equity
Industrial Partners Corp. for $37,000,000, and Equity Industrial will lease the
distribution centers back to Penn Traffic for an initial term of 15 years, with
four consecutive five year options to renew the lease (except that the lease
term will end no later than the 14th anniversary of the expiration of the
initial term with respect to the Pennsylvania distribution centers). In addition
to the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction, Penn Traffic expects to fund
its operations upon emergence from chapter 11 with a working capital revolving
credit facility.

                  Penn Traffic filed its initial Plan of Reorganization and
Disclosure Statement on August 20, 2004, but postponed the hearing to approve
the Disclosure Statement to explore multiple compelling proposals for a
sale-leaseback transaction with respect to its owned properties. Following
extensive negotiations with several potential buyers, Penn Traffic concluded
that the sale-leaseback transaction with Equity Industrial Partners Corp.,
together with a working capital revolving credit facility, would provide the
Company with the most optimal levels of liquidity to repay all of its current
senior secured bank debt in full, to invest in continuing to modernize and
enhance its store base, and for other working capital needs after emerging from
chapter 11. A hearing to approve the Amended Disclosure Statement is scheduled
for January 27, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. The Company expects to emerge from chapter 11
in the first quarter of 2005.

                  Robert Chapman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Penn
Traffic, said: "We are very pleased to have reached agreement with Equity
Industrial Partners

<PAGE>

Corp. to sell and then lease back our five distribution centers. This
transaction will help provide the Company with the financial strength and
flexibility to emerge from chapter 11 with dramatically reduced debt and strong
liquidity to fund our operations going forward. The Company is now
well-positioned to complete our restructuring efforts within the next couple of
months, and to come out of chapter 11 with a solid core of very healthy and
competitive supermarkets, together with strong bakery and wholesale/franchise
operations. We are very excited and optimistic about Penn Traffic's future."
