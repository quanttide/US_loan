surety or guarantor; and all other notices and demands otherwise required by
law which the Guarantors may lawfully waive.&#160;
In the event this Guaranty is enforced by suit or otherwise, the

which might materially and adversely affect its ability to perform under this
Guaranty.&#160; In the event of any breach of
said covenants and agreements, or in the event of any Guarantor&#146;s insolvency or
bankruptcy, all indebtedness and obligations of Obligor, regardless of their terms,
shall at CLC&#146;s election, and without notice, be deemed for the purposes of this
Guaranty to have become immediately due and payable, and at CLC&#146;s election, the
Guarantors shall promptly pay CLC the entire amount of said indebtedness and

necessary or advisable to enforce this Guaranty, including, without limitation,
the enjoining of any breach or threatened breach of this paragraph.</font></p>
