ANNOUNCES DECEMBER CASH DISTRIBUTION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>DALLAS, Texas, December&nbsp;20, 2004 </B>&#150; Bank of America, N.A., as Trustee of the Permian Basin
Royalty Trust (NYSE &#150; PBT), today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of
beneficial interest of $.116483 per unit, payable on January&nbsp;14, 2005, to unit holders of record on
December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month&#146;s distribution increased from the previous month due primarily to higher production
for both oil and gas, as well as higher oil and gas prices. Additionally, revenues from the Texas
Royalty Properties for the previous month were decreased by approximately $239,000 due to a
repayment of revenues to Burlington Resources, Inc. of proceeds that were erroneously paid to the
Trust in prior years. This is a non-recurring transaction. The worldwide market conditions
continue to affect the pricing for domestic production. It is difficult to predict what effect
these conditions will have on future distributions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production for Waddell Ranch and the Texas Royalty Properties combined for oil and gas
respectively was 74,119 bbls and 332,856 mcf. The average price for oil was $48.22 per bbl and for
gas was $6.57 per mcf. This would primarily reflect production for the month of October. Capital
expenditures were approximately $59,900. The numbers provided reflect what was net to the Trust.
