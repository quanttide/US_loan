Item 8.01.     Other Events.

               On December 29, 2004, the Registrant  will cause the issuance and
        sale of Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-SL4, (the
        "Certificates")  pursuant to a Pooling  and  Servicing  Agreement  to be
        dated as of December 1, 2004, among the Registrant,  Residential Funding
        Corporation,   as  Master  Servicer  and  Deutsche  Bank  Trust  Company
        Americas, as Trustee.

               In  connection  with  the  sale  of  the  Series  2004-SL4,  (the
        "Underwritten  Certificates"),   the  Registrant  has  been  advised  by
        Residential Funding Securities Corporation (the "Underwriter"), that the
        Underwriter has furnished to prospective  investors certain yield tables
        and other computational  materials (the "Computational  Materials") with
        respect to the Underwritten Certificates following the effective date of
        Registration Statement No. 333-117232, which Computational Materials are
        being filed manually as exhibits to this report.

               The   Computational   Materials   have  been   provided   by  the
        Underwriter.   The  information  in  the   Computational   Materials  is
        preliminary and may be superseded by the Prospectus  Supplement relating
        to the Certificates and by any other information subsequently filed with
        the Securities and Exchange Commission.

               The  Computational  Materials  consist of the pages  that  appear
        after the Form SE cover sheet dated December 22, 2004.

               The  Computational  Materials were prepared by the Underwriter at
        the  request  of certain  prospective  investors,  based on  assumptions
        provided  by,  and   satisfying  the  special   requirements   of,  such
        prospective  investors.  The  Computational  Materials  may be  based on
        assumptions that differ from the assumptions set forth in the Prospectus
        Supplement.  The  Computational  Materials  may not include,  and do not
        purport to include,  information  based on  assumptions  representing  a
        complete  set of  possible  scenarios.  Accordingly,  the  Computational
        Materials may not be relevant to or appropriate for investors other than
        those specifically requesting them.

               In addition,  the actual  characteristics  and performance of the
        mortgage loans underlying the Underwritten  Certificates  (the "Mortgage
        Loans")  may  differ  from  the  assumptions  used in the  Computational
        Materials,  which are  hypothetical in nature and which were provided to
        certain investors only to give a general sense of how the yield, average
        life,  duration,  expected maturity,  interest rate sensitivity and cash
        flow characteristics of a particular class of Underwritten  Certificates
        might vary under varying prepayment and other scenarios.  Any difference
        between such assumptions and the actual  characteristics and performance
        of the  Mortgage  Loans  will  affect the actual  yield,  average  life,
        duration,  expected  maturity,  interest rate  sensitivity and cash flow
        characteristics of a particular class of Underwritten Certificates.
