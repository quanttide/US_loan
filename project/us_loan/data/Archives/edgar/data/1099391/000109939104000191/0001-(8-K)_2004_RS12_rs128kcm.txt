A-I-1,  Class A-I-2,  Class A-I-3,  Class A-I-4, Class A-I-5, Class A-I-6, Class
M-I-1, Class M-I-2, Class M-I-3, Class M-I-4, Class A-II-1,  Class A-II-2, Class
A-II-3,  Class M-II-1,  Class M-II-2,  Class M-II-3, Class M-II-4, Class M-II-5,
Class M-II-6,  Class M-II-7,  Class SB-I,  Class SB-II,  Class R-I,  Class R-II,
Class  R-III and Class R-IV  Certificates  (the  "Certificates")  pursuant  to a
Pooling and  Servicing  Agreement to be dated as of December 1, 2004,  among the
Registrant,  Residential  Funding  Corporation,  as Master Servicer and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee.

           In  connection  with the sale of the Series  2004-RS12,  Class A-I-1,
Class A-I-2,  Class A-I-3,  Class A-I-4,  Class A-I-5, Class A-I-6, Class M-I-1,
Class M-I-2, Class M-I-3, Class M-I-4, Class A-II-1, Class A-II-2, Class A-II-3,
Class M-II-1,  Class M-II-2,  Class M-II-3,  Class M-II-4,  Class M-II-5,  Class
M-II-6 and Class M-II-7  Certificates  (the  "Underwritten  Certificates"),  the
Registrant has been advised by J.P. Morgan  Securities Inc.,  Greenwich  Capital
Markets,  Inc.,  Residential  Funding  Securities  Corporation and Credit Suisse
First Boston LLC (collectively, the "Underwriters"),  that the Underwriters have
furnished to prospective  investors certain yield tables and other computational
materials  (the  "Computational  Materials")  with  respect to the  Underwritten
Certificates   following  the  effective  date  of  Registration  Statement  No.
333-117232,  which Computational  Materials are being filed manually as exhibits
to this report.

           The  Computational  Materials have been provided by the Underwriters.
The  information  in the  Computational  Materials  is  preliminary  and  may be
superseded by the Prospectus  Supplement relating to the Certificates and by any
other   information   subsequently   filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission.

           The  Computational  Materials  consist of the pages that appear after
the Form SE cover dated December 22, 2004.

           The Computational  Materials were prepared by the Underwriters at the
request of certain prospective investors,  based on assumptions provided by, and
satisfying  the  special  requirements  of,  such  prospective  investors.   The
Computational  Materials  may be  based  on  assumptions  that  differ  from the
assumptions set forth in the Prospectus Supplement.  The Computational Materials
may not include, and do not purport to include, information based on assumptions
representing   a  complete   set  of  possible   scenarios.   Accordingly,   the
Computational  Materials  may not be relevant to or  appropriate  for  investors
other than those specifically requesting them.

           In  addition,  the  actual  characteristics  and  performance  of the
mortgage loans underlying the Underwritten  Certificates  (the "Mortgage Loans")
may differ from the assumptions used in the Computational  Materials,  which are
hypothetical in nature and which were provided to certain investors only to give
a general sense of how the yield,  average life,  duration,  expected  maturity,
interest rate sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of a particular class of
Underwritten   Certificates  might  vary  under  varying  prepayment  and  other
scenarios.   Any   difference   between   such   assumptions   and  the   actual
characteristics  and  performance  of the Mortgage  Loans will affect the actual
yield, average life, duration,  expected maturity, interest rate sensitivity and
cash flow characteristics of a particular class of Underwritten Certificates.
