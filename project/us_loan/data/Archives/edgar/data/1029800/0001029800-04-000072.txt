Item 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

     On December 15, 2004,  the  Company's  Board of  Directors  authorized  the
     Company's management to adopt a new nonqualified deferred compensation plan
     applicable to post-2004 deferrals. The new plan will be based in large part
     on the  Pre-2005  Plan (See Item 1.02),  and is required as a result of the
     new tax law  requirements  imposed by Internal  Revenue Code Section  409A,
     which was added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  Under the terms
     of the new plan, an account will be  established  for each  participant  to
     record the  participant's  deferrals  and  interest  credits  thereon.  The
     following is a summary of the significant terms of the new plan:



     Eligibility:  Participation  is limited to employees  of the Company  whose
     annual compensation is at least $150,000.

     Deferrals: A  participant  may defer up to 100% of the  participant's  base
     salary and  bonus.  Amounts  deferred  are  credited  with  interest  rates
     determined by the Company's Compensation  Committee annually.  Deferrals of
     base salary or bonus must be made prior to the calendar  year in which such
     compensation will be paid.

     Distributions:  When making a deferral  election,  a participant  will also
     make an election  regarding the timing and manner of  distributions  of the
     participant's deferrals and interest thereon.  Changes in any such election
     will be  permitted  only to the extent  allowed by  Internal  Revenue  Code
     Section 409A. All  distributions  under the Plan will be made in accordance
     with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

     Effective Date: The plan will be effective as of January 1, 2005.


Item 1.02    Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement

     On December 15, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors  approved a freezing
     of the  Company's  Excess  Benefit  and  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  (the
     "Pre-2005 Plan") effective  December 31, 2004 such that no new participants
     be admitted to the Pre-2005 Plan and no further  deferrals or contributions
     be  permissible  under such plan in order to address  certain  requirements
     under new  Section  409A of the  Internal  Revenue  Code as  enacted by the
     American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Board of Directors also  authorized
     the  Company's  management  to  adopt a new  Excess  Benefit  and  Deferred
     Compensation  Plan to be  effective as of January 1, 2005 with such changes
     as may be needed to comply with the  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004.
