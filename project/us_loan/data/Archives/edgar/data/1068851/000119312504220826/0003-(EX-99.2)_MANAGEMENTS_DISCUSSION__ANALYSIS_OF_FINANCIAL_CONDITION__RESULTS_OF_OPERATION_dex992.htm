sheets and statements of income. This section should be read in conjunction with the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
Commercial Merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and therefore the historical financial data of the Company has been restated to include the accounts and operations of Commercial for all periods prior to February 23, 2001. </FONT></P>

income from investment in securities. The revenues are offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and non-interest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest
income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company&#146;s largest source of revenue, representing 59.8% of
total revenue during 2003. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and margin. The low rate environment has negatively impacted the Company&#146;s net interest
margin however the Company has recognized increased net interest income due to the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreasing at a greater rate than the decrease in the rate earned on interest earning assets and an increase in the volume
of interest-earning assets. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Three principal components of the
Company&#146;s growth strategy are internal growth, stringent cost control practices and strategic merger transactions. The Company focuses on continual internal growth. Each Banking Center is operated as a separate profit center, maintaining
separate data with respect to its net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth, loan growth and overall profitability. Banking Center Presidents and Managers are accountable for performance in these areas and compensated accordingly. The
Company also focuses on maintaining stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has invested significantly in the infrastructure required to centralize many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan application
processing. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate substantial additional growth while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through certain economies of scale. The Company also intends to continue to
seek expansion opportunities. During 2003, eleven banking centers were acquired in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The acquisitions of Abrams and Dallas Bancshares were completed in May and June 2003, respectively, adding three banking centers in
Dallas. The mergers with MainBancorp and FSBNT were completed in November and December 2003, respectively, adding an additional eight banking centers in Dallas. As a part of these acquisitions, two of the acquired banking centers were combined into
existing banking centers nearby bringing the total to nine banking centers added in 2003. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

same periods. Earnings growth during both 2003 and 2002 resulted principally from an increase in loan volume and acquisitions, including the Abrams, Dallas Bancshares, Mainbancorp and FSBNT acquisitions. Earnings growth during both 2002 and 2001
also resulted principally from an increase in loan volume and acquisitions, including the Texas Guaranty, First State, Paradigm, FNB, Southwest and Commercial acquisitions. The Company posted returns on average assets of 1.32%, 1.45% and 1.09% and
returns on average equity of 15.60%, 18.66% and 15.19% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company&#146;s efficiency ratio was 51.58% in 2003, 50.36% in 2002 and 60.14% in 2001. </FONT></P> <P

the Commercial Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,537,220 (after two for one stock split) shares of its Common Stock to the holders of Commercial common stock. In connection with the Commercial Merger, the Company incurred approximately
$2.4 million in pretax merger-related expenses and other charges (the &#147;Special Charge&#148;). The transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and therefore the historical financial data of the Company has been restated to include

the form of a provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company&#146;s loan portfolio. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, management
presents a monthly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank&#146;s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. In making its evaluation,
management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, industry diversification of the Company&#146;s commercial loan portfolio, the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of the
Company&#146;s loan portfolio, current economic changes that may affect the borrower&#146;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company&#146;s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant
factors. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management&#146;s judgment, should be charged off. Charge-offs occur when loans are deemed to be
uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, &#147;Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,&#148; as amended by SFAS
118, and allowance allocations determined in accordance with SFAS No. 5, &#147;Accounting for Contingencies.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

securities portfolio resulting from increased amortization of purchased premiums as a result of the high level of refinancings of home mortgages experienced during 2003. Declines in yields on interest-earning assets were partially offset by

established through charges to income in the form of the provision in order to bring the Company&#146;s allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under &#147;Financial Condition -
Allowance for Credit Losses&#148;. The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2003 was $10.4 million, representing 1.34% of outstanding loans. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $483,000 compared with $1.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, an additional $500,000 provision for credit loss was made in anticipation of increased charge-offs related to loans acquired through acquisitions that year. The increased charge-offs were made
in 2003, with net loan charge-offs of $1.618 million compared to $396,000 in loan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company had $238,000 in net loan charge-offs during 2001. </FONT></P> <P

related fees. Non-interest income does not include loan origination fees which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. Banking related service fees include check cashing fees, official
check fees, safe deposit box rent and currency handling fees. In 2003, noninterest income totaled $17.0 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 46.3% compared with $11.6 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to an increase in insufficient
funds charges and customer service charges which resulted from an increase in the number of accounts due to the Abrams, Dallas Bancshares, MainBancorp and FSBNT acquisitions. The four acquisitions in 2003 added approximately 33,500 deposit accounts
and over 5,000 debit cards. Noninterest income for 2002 was $11.6 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 34.2% from $8.6 million in 2001, resulting largely from an increase in service charges due to the additional deposit accounts from the Texas
Guaranty, First State, Paradigm, FNB and Southwest acquisitions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

employed by the company increased from 501 at December 31, 2002 to 629 at December 31, 2003. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.4 million from $13.0 million at December 31, 2001 to $16.4 million at December 31, 2002 primarily due to

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Efficiency Ratio</I>. The efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in management&#146;s internal evaluation of the Company and is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles. The
efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense, excluding securities losses and credit loss provisions, by net interest income plus noninterest income. Additionally, taxes are not part of this calculation. An increase in the
efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources. The Company&#146;s efficiency ratio was 51.58% at December 31, 2003, a
slight increase from 50.36% at December 31, 2002. This increase was principally due the acquisition of MainBancorp and FSBNT in November and December 2003, respectively. The Company&#146;s efficiency ratio was 60.14% at December 31, 2001.

taxable income, the amount of tax-exempt income, the amount of nondeductible interest expense and the amount of other nondeductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2003, income tax expense was $12.4 million compared with $9.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 and $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increases were primarily attributable to higher pretax net earnings which resulted from an increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31,
2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 and 2001. In addition, the Company incurred $2.4 million in merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2001 which had a tax benefit of approximately $849,000. The effective tax rate in
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 31.9%, 30.9% and 29.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% during the comparable periods primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income
from loans and securities. Prior to 2002, the effective tax rate was also impacted by non-deductible goodwill amortization. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

substantially all of the Company&#146;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, such as cash, securities, loans and deposits, their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates, which do not
necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates. The Company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. See &#147;Financial Condition -

million or 13.3% from $679.6 million at December 31, 2002. The growth in loans is primarily attributable to the combined effect of internal growth and the Abrams, Dallas Bancshares, MainBancorp and FSBNT acquisitions. At December 31, 2003, total
loans at the banking centers acquired in 2003 totaled $125.9 million. Total loans at the banking centers acquired in 2002, which includes Texas Guaranty, First State, Paradigm, FNB and Southwest acquisitions, decreased $49.9 million from their
December 31, 2002 balance of $225.4 million, while total loans at all banking centers in existence at January 1, 2002 increased approximately $13.5 million from 2002 to 2003. The decrease in loans from the 2002 acquisitions is due to expected
pay-offs and charge-offs previously identified prior to the respective acquisition date and an increase in re-financing that occurred in reaction to the low rate environment. The Company was unwilling to re-finance at low, long-term fixed rates. At
December 31, 2003, total loans were 37.0% of deposits and 32.1% of total assets. At December 31, 2002, total loans were 42.8% of deposits and 37.3% of total assets. Loans increased 60.1% during 2002 from $424.4 million at December 31, 2001 to $679.6
million at December 31, 2002. The growth in loans is primarily attributable to internal growth and the 2002 acquisitions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

on growing its commercial mortgage and commercial loan portfolios. The Company offers a variety of commercial lending products including term loans and lines of credit. The Company also offers a broad range of short to medium-term commercial loans,
primarily collateralized, to businesses for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisitions of real estate and improvements) and the purchase of equipment and machinery. Historically, the Company has
originated loans for its own account and has not securitized its loans. The purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure. All loans in the 1-4 family residential category were originated by the Company. </FONT></P> <P

weekly. In addition to an officers&#146; loan committee evaluation, loans from $2.0 million to $7.5 million are evaluated and acted upon by the Directors Loan Committee, which consists of three directors and meets as necessary and loans over $7.5

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Commercial Loans.</U> In nearly all cases, the Company&#146;s commercial loans are made in the Company&#146;s primary market area and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower&#146;s ability to service such
debt from income. As a general practice, the Company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and obtains a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Working capital loans are
primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets. As a result, commercial loans involve additional complexities, variables and risks and require more thorough underwriting and
servicing than other types of loans. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition to commercial
loans, the Company makes commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real estate. The Company&#146;s commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on real estate, typically have variable interest rates and amortize over a ten to 15
year period. Payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the
economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. The Company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property&#146;s operating history, future operating projections, current and
projected occupancy, location and physical condition in connection with underwriting these loans. The underwriting analysis also includes credit verification, appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower. </FONT></P> <P

construction of residential and, to a limited extent, nonresidential properties. Construction loans generally are secured by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates. The Company conducts periodic inspections, either directly or
through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans. Underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the Company&#146;s construction lending activities. Construction loans involve additional risks
attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market
value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio. As a result of these
uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If the Company
is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project
and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. While the Company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending, no assurance can be given that these
procedures will prevent losses from the risks described above. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2"><U>Agriculture Loans.</U> The Company provides agricultural loans for short-term crop production, including rice, cotton, milo and corn, farm equipment financing and agricultural real estate financing. The Company evaluates agricultural
borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability, level of experience in their particular agricultural industry, overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common
to the industry. Because agricultural loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature, the Company routinely makes on-site visits and inspections in order to monitor and identify such risks. </FONT></P> <P

&#147;A&#148;-credit automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, home improvement loans, home equity loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans
typically range from 12 to 120 months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan. Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by
rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not
warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#146;s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be
adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. </FONT></P> <P

activity has consisted of the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans collateralized by owner-occupied properties located in the Company&#146;s market areas. The Company offers a variety of mortgage loan products which generally are
amortized over five to 25 years. Loans collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 90% of appraised value or have mortgage insurance. The Company requires mortgage title insurance
and hazard insurance. The Company has elected to keep all 1-4 family residential loans for its own account rather than selling such loans into the secondary market. By doing so, the Company is able to realize a higher yield on these loans; however,
the Company also incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with nonpayments on such loans. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company&#146;s loan portfolio. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, management presents a
monthly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank&#146;s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. In making its evaluation, management
considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, industry diversification of the Company&#146;s commercial loan portfolio, the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of the Company&#146;s
loan portfolio, current economic changes that may affect the borrower&#146;s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company&#146;s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors.
Charge-offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"

&#147;doubtful&#148; are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard accounts but with an increased risk that a loss may occur, or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge-off if liquidated at present. Loans classified
as &#147;loss&#148; are those loans which are in the process of being charged off. For each classified loan, the Company generally allocates a specific loan loss reserve equal to a predetermined percentage of the loan amount, depending on the
classification. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition to the internally classified loan
list and delinquency list of loans, the Company maintains a separate &#147;watch list&#148; which further aids the Company in monitoring loan portfolios. Watch list loans have one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or
pertinent ratios of the loan account that have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted. These loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan (substandard or doubtful) but do show weakened elements compared
with those of a satisfactory credit. The Company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management considers the risk
classification or delinquency status of loans and other factors, such as collateral value, portfolio composition, trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers. Management establishes specific allowances for loans which
management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or delinquent status. An unallocated allowance is also established based on the Company&#146;s historical charge-off experience and existing general
economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volume and concentrations and seasoning of the loan portfolio. The Company then charges to operations a provision for
credit losses to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an adequate level determined by the foregoing methodology. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

funds received from deposit growth at lower current yields and the reinvestment of proceeds from the early repayment of mortgage-backed securities in similar investments, also at lower current yields. The early repayment of mortgage-backed
securities primarily resulted from borrower refinancing due to lower market interest rates. The overall growth in the securities portfolio over the comparable periods was primarily funded by deposit growth. </FONT></P> <P

securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Freddie Mac. These
securities are deemed to have high credit ratings, and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">However, unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash
flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop
because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages. Thus, the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period. Therefore, these securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment. As
interest rates rise, the opposite will generally be true. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently, the average life of this
security will not be unduly shortened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments will increase. At December 31, 2003, 42.64% of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a
weighted average life of 4.68 years. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Collateralized mortgage
obligations (CMOs) are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages. The pools can be Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac pools or they can be private-label pools. The CMOs are designed so that the mortgage collateral will generate a cash flow
sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds. The mortgage collateral pool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules, provided that the collateral cash flow is adequate to meet scheduled bond payments.
This is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments on the underlying mortgage pools are allocated in different order. The bond&#146;s cash flow, for example can be dedicated to one class of bondholders at a time, thereby
increasing call protection to bondholders. In private-label CMOs, losses on underlying mortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority, which means that the senior classes have
enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">At the date of purchase, the Company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the
classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity.
Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Investments not
classified as either held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity
until realized. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Deposits </I></FONT></P> <P

Company&#146;s present and future senior indebtedness. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of each trust&#146;s obligations under the trust securities issued by each respective trust provided that such trust has
funds to pay the interest and principal. The debentures may be prepaid if certain events occur, including a change in the tax status or regulatory capital treatment of the Capital Securities or a change in existing laws that requires the trusts to
register as an investment company. Under the provisions of each issue of the debentures, the Company has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time to time, for periods not exceeding five years. If interest
payments on either issue of the debentures are deferred, the distributions on the respective trust preferred securities will also be deferred. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

Entities.&#148; FIN 46R requires that trust preferred securities be deconsolidated from the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted FIN 46R on January 1, 2004 and as a result, no longer reflects the trust preferred
securities in its consolidated financial statements. Instead, the junior subordinated debentures are shown as liabilities in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets and interest expense associated with the junior subordinated debentures is
shown as interest expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of income. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

consolidated financial statements, the Federal Reserve may in the future disallow inclusion of the trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. In July 2003, the Federal Reserve issued a supervisory letter instructing bank
holding companies to continue to include the trust preferred securities in their Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes until further notice. The Federal Reserve has also stated that it is reviewing the regulatory implications of any
accounting treatment changes and, if necessary or warranted, will provide further guidance. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the Company&#146;s assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to
maturity. Based upon the nature of the Company&#146;s operations, the Company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. The Company does not own any trading assets. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time
maximizing income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent, and that the goal is to identify and accept the risks. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

the Company, in accordance with policies approved by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. The ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the ALCO
considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things,
the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and
borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (i) an analysis of relationships
between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and (ii) an interest rate shock simulation model. The Company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates. </FONT></P> <P

within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates. The management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific points in time (&#147;GAP&#148;) and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix
of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates. A company is considered to be asset sensitive, or having a positive GAP,
when the amount of its interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest-bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period. Conversely, a company is considered to be liability
sensitive, or having a negative GAP, when the amount of its interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest-earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period. During a
period of rising interest rates, a negative GAP would tend to affect net interest income adversely, while a positive GAP would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative GAP would tend
to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive GAP would tend to affect net interest income adversely. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

inherent in any GAP analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change. In addition to GAP analysis, the Company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate
sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet, respectively. Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment
portfolio. Assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts. Based on the Company&#146;s December 31, 2003 simulation analysis, the Company estimates that its current net interest income would
decrease by approximately 4.40% over the next twelve months assuming an immediate 100 basis point decline in rates and increase by approximately 0.4% over the next twelve months assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in rates. The Company
estimates that its current net interest income would decrease by approximately 9.8% over the next twelve months assuming an immediate 200 basis point decline in rates and increase by approximately 0.3% over the next twelve months assuming an
immediate 200 basis point increase in rates. The results are primarily from the behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits. The Company has found that historically, interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the
discount and federal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a GAP analysis. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the Company on an ongoing basis. During the three years ended December 31, 2003, the Company&#146;s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits and the
issuance of trust preferred securities, as previously discussed. Although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, the Company does not generally
rely on these external funding sources. The cash and federal funds sold position, supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios, have generally created an adequate liquidity position. </FONT></P> <P

or which will mature in the near future. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $83.7 million, up from $80.8 million, at December 31, 2002. The increase was mainly due to an increase in total deposits and the number of
deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had trust preferred securities outstanding of $58.0 million compared with $33.0 million at December 31, 2002. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

imposed by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the FDIC and the Texas Banking Department. Both the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital requirements for
assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy. These standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off-balance sheet exposure, adjusted for credit risk. The risk-based capital standards
currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding
liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate relative risk weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet
items. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The risk-based capital standards issued by the Federal
Reserve Board require all bank holding companies to have &#147;Tier 1 capital&#148; of at least 4.0% and &#147;total risk-based&#148; capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) of at least 8.0% of total risk-weighted tangible assets. &#147;Tier 1 capital&#148;
generally includes common shareholders&#146; equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings, less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles. &#147;Tier 2 capital&#148; may consist of
a limited amount of intermediate-term preferred stock, a limited amount of term subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities, perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, and a limited amount of the
general valuation allowance for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital is &#147;total risk-based capital.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

considered to be strong banking organizations, rated composite 1 under applicable federal guidelines, and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth. Other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least
4.0%. These rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages,
without significant reliance on intangible assets. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Pursuant to
FDICIA, each federal banking agency revised its risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities, as well as reflect the
actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages. The Bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the FDIC that are substantially similar to the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s guidelines. Also pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC
has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the Bank would be considered &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly
