Borders Group will pay to GRM an annual fee of $100,000 for service as a director of Paperchase and for the additional

              granted on January 1 of each year, with the specific number of shares to be determined by dividing $50,000 by the fair

              monthly basis from July through December of each year. In addition, GRM will be eligible for incentive payments as if he
              were a participant in the annual incentive plan for management employees of Paperchase, with a target incentive payment
              of $50,000 per year and a maximum incentive payment of $100,000 per year. The restricted shares will vest on a pro rata
              basis during the calendar year in which they are granted.</FONT></TD>
