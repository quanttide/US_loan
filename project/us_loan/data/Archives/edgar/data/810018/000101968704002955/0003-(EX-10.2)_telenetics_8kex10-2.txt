days prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such
notice in writing no later than one (1) Business Day following the day (i)(A)
when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to

Statement and (C) with respect to the Registration Statement or any

notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption

in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
that requires any revisions to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or other
documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus,
as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

                  (d) Use its best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if
issued, obtain the withdrawal of, (i) any order suspending the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement or (ii) any suspension of the qualification (or

<PAGE>

                  (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities,
use its best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling
Holders in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from
such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and
sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the
United States as any Holder requests in writing, to keep each such registration
or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness
Period and to do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to
enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities
covered by a Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it
is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or
subject the Company to any material tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not
then so subject.

                  (i) Cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to
be sold pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates shall, if
required under the terms of this Agreement, be free of all restrictive legends,
and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and
registered in such names as any Holder may request within the applicable time
periods prescribed for the issuance of shares upon exercise of a Warrant.

                  (j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by SECTION
3(c)(vi), as promptly as possible, prepare a supplement or amendment, including
a post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as
thereafter delivered, neither the Registration Statement nor such Prospectus
will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (k) Use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities
relating to such Registration Statement to be listed on the OTC Bulletin Board,
Nasdaq SmallCap Market, Nasdaq National Market, American Stock Exchange and any
other securities exchange, quotation system or market, if any, on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed as and when required pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement.

                  (l) Comply in all material respects with all applicable rules
and regulations of the Commission and make generally available to its security
holders earning statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 not later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month
period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a
fiscal year) commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the
Company after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which statement
shall conform to the requirements of Rule 158.

                  (m) If the Registration Statement refers to any Holder by name
or otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, then such Holder
shall have the right to require (if such reference to such Holder by name or
otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any similar federal statute
then in force) the deletion of the reference to such Holder in any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement filed or prepared subsequent to the
time that such reference ceases to be required.

                  Each Holder covenants and agrees that (i) it will not sell any
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until it has received
copies of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented as contemplated in
SECTION 3(g) and notice from the Company that such Registration Statement and
any post-effective amendments thereto have become effective as contemplated by
SECTION 3(c), (ii) it and its officers, directors or Affiliates, if any, will

                                      -6-


<PAGE>

comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as
applicable to them in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement and (iii) it will furnish to the Company
information regarding such Holder and the distribution of such Registrable
Securities as is required by law to be disclosed in the Registration Statement,
and the Company may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of
any such Holder who unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a
reasonable time after receiving such request.

                  The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as practicable. The Company agrees
and acknowledges that any periods during which the Holder is required to
discontinue the disposition of the Registrable Securities are subject to the
provisions of SECTION 2(d) above.

                  Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable
Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of
any event of the kind described in SECTION 3(c)(ii), 3(c)(iii), 3(c)(iv),
3(c)(v) or 3(c)(vi), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holder's
receipt of the copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration
Statement contemplated by SECTION 3(j), or until it is advised in writing (the
"ADVICE") by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be
resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement.

                  (n) If (i) there is material non-public information regarding
the Company which the Company's Board of Directors (the "BOARD") reasonably
determines not to be in the Company's best interest to disclose and which the
Company is not otherwise required to disclose, or (ii) there is a significant
business opportunity (including, but not limited to, the acquisition or
disposition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business) or any
merger, consolidation, tender offer or other similar transaction) available to
the Company which the Board reasonably determines not to be in the Company's
best interest to disclose, then the Company may postpone or suspend filing or
effectiveness of a registration statement for a period not to exceed 20
consecutive days, provided that the Company may not postpone or suspend its
obligation under this SECTION 3(N) for more than 45 days in the aggregate during
any 12-month period; provided, however, that no such postponement or suspension
shall be permitted for consecutive 20-day periods, arising out of the same set
of facts, circumstances or transactions.

         4.       REGISTRATION EXPENSES.

Statement, any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus or form of prospectus or in
any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising
solely out of or based solely upon any omission of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of
any Prospectus or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission

                                      -8-


<PAGE>

is contained in any information so furnished in writing by the Holder or other
Indemnified Party to the Company specifically for inclusion in the Registration
Statement or such Prospectus and that such information was reasonably relied
upon by the Company for use in the Registration Statement, such Prospectus or
such form of prospectus or to the extent that such information relates to the
Holder or the Holder's proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities
and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by the Holder expressly for
use in the Registration Statement, such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus.

                  (c) CONDUCT OF INDEMNIFICATION PROCEEDINGS. If any Proceeding
shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder
(an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), such Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the
Person from whom indemnity is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing, and
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the
payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities
pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have
proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

                  An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in
writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3)
the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel (which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) that a conflict of interest is likely to
exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the
Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnifying Party
shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any
settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party
is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of
such Proceeding.

                  All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including
reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with
investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not
inconsistent with this SECTION 5) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as
incurred, within ten (10) Business Days of written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to
undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally
judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder).

                  (d) CONTRIBUTION. If a claim for indemnification under SECTION
5(a) or SECTION 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party because of a failure
or refusal of a governmental authority to enforce such indemnification in
accordance with its terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the
actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue

                                      -9-





<PAGE>

statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact,
has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result
of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
in SECTION 5(c), any reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses
incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such
party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the
indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in
accordance with its terms.

                  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this SECTION 5(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

                  The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have
to the Indemnified Parties.

         6.       RULE 144.

                  Provided the Company is subject to the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act, as long as the Holder owns Shares, the Company covenants to
use its best efforts to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and
file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the
Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act and to promptly furnish or make available to the Holders true and complete
copies of all such filings. As long as the Holder owns Shares, if the Company is
not required to file reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the Company will prepare and furnish to the Holder and make publicly
available in accordance with Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act
annual and quarterly financial statements, together with a discussion and
analysis of such financial statements in form and substance substantially
similar to those that would otherwise be required to be included in reports
required by Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as any other
information required thereby, in the time period that such filings would have
been required to have been made under the Exchange Act. The Company further
covenants that it will take such further action as the Holder may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Person to
sell Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation
of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act,
including providing any legal opinions relating to such sale pursuant to Rule
144. Upon the request of the Holder, the Company shall deliver to the Holder a
written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied
with such requirements.

         7.       MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach by the Company or by
the Holder, of any of their obligations under this Agreement, the Holder or the
Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all
rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages,
will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The
Company and the Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate
compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any
action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

                                      -10-





<PAGE>

                  (b) NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has, as of the date hereof entered into and currently in
effect, nor shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on or after the date
of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that
is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holder in this Agreement or
otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

                  (c) PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATIONS. If at any time when there is not
an effective Registration Statement covering the Registrable Securities, the
Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others
under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4
or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then
equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with
any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in
connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, the Company shall
send to each holder of Registrable Securities written notice of such
determination and, if within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, any
such holder shall so request in writing, (which request shall specify the
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by the Holders), the Company
will cause the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable
Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Holder, to
the extent requisite to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities so
to be registered, provided that if at any time after giving written notice of
its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company
shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such
securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to the Holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination
not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to
pay expenses in accordance with SECTION 4 hereof), and (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any
Registrable Securities being registered pursuant to this SECTION 7(c) for the
same period as the delay in registering such other securities. The Company shall
include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable
Securities the Holder requests to be registered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to
this SECTION 7(c) that are eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the
Securities Act. In the case of an underwritten public offering, if the managing
underwriter(s) or underwriter(s) should reasonably object to the inclusion of
the Registrable Securities in such registration statement, then if the Company
after consultation with the managing underwriter should reasonably determine
that the inclusion of such Registrable Securities, would adversely affect the
offering contemplated in such registration statement, and based on such
determination recommends inclusion in such registration statement of fewer or
none of the Registrable Securities of the Holders, then (x) the number of
Registrable Securities of the Holders included in such registration statement
shall be reduced pro-rata among such Holders (based upon the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration), if the
Company after consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of
fewer Registrable Securities, or (y) none of the Registrable Securities of the
Holders shall be included in such registration statement, if the Company after
consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of none of such
Registrable Securities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if securities are being offered
for the account of other persons or entities as well as the Company, such
reduction shall not represent a greater fraction of the number of Registrable
Securities intended to be offered by the Holders than the fraction of similar
reductions imposed on such other persons or entities (other than the Company).

                  (d) AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company
and each of the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to
depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates
exclusively to the rights of Holders and that does not directly or indirectly

                                      -11-





<PAGE>

affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a
majority of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates;
provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended,
modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence.

                  (e) NOTICES. Any and all notices or other communications or
deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing

                  (f) SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted
assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Holder and its successors and
permitted assigns. The Company may not assign this Agreement or any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Holder.
Each Holder may assign its rights hereunder in the manner and to the Persons as
permitted under this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.

                  (g) ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The rights of the
Holder hereunder, including the right to have the Company register for resale
Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be
automatically assignable by the Holder to any Affiliate of the Holder or any
other Holder or Affiliate of any other Holder of all or a portion of the
Registrable Securities if: (i) the Holder agrees in writing with the transferee
or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to
the Company within a reasonable time after such assignment, (ii) the Company is,
within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with
written notice of (a) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and
(b) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being
transferred or assigned, (iii) following such transfer or assignment the further
disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignees is restricted
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, (iv) at or before
the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of
this Section, the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to
be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement, and (v) such transfer shall
have been made in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Purchase
Agreement. In addition, each Holder shall have the right to assign its rights
hereunder to any other Person with the prior written consent of the Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights to assignment shall
apply to the Holders (and to subsequent) successors and assigns.

                  (h) COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission, such signature shall create a valid binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with
the same force and effect as if such facsimile signature were the original
thereof.

                  (i) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard

cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  (k) SEVERABILITY. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable in any respect, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants
and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto
shall use their reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to
achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such
term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared
to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that
may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.
