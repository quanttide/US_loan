         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth,
the undersigned, Telenetics Corporation, a California corporation (together with
its successors and assigns, the "ISSUER"), hereby certifies that Taglich

Common Stock of the Issuer, at an exercise price per share equal to the Warrant
Price then in effect, subject, however, to the provisions and upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth. This Warrant is one of the "Warrants" issued
pursuant to the Letter Agreement (as defined in SECTION 9 hereof). Capitalized
terms used in this Warrant and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings specified in SECTION 9 hereof.

1.       TERM.

         The right to subscribe for and purchase shares of Warrant Stock
represented hereby shall commence on the date of issuance of this Warrant and
shall expire at 5:00 p.m., eastern time, on December 22, 2009 (such period
being the "TERM").

2.       METHOD OF EXERCISE PAYMENT; ISSUANCE OF NEW WARRANT; TRANSFER AND
         EXCHANGE.

         (a) TIME OF EXERCISE. The purchase rights represented by this Warrant
may be exercised in whole or in part at any time and from time to time during
the Term.

                                      -1-


<PAGE>

         (b) METHOD OF EXERCISE. The Holder hereof may exercise this Warrant, in
whole or in part, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the exercise form
attached hereto duly executed) at the principal office of the Issuer, together
with the payment to the Issuer of an amount of consideration therefor equal to
the Warrant Price in effect on the date of such exercise multiplied by the
number of shares of Warrant Stock with respect to which this Warrant is then
being exercised, payable at such Holder's election (i) by certified or official
bank check or by wire transfer to an account designated by the Issuer, (ii) by
"CASHLESS EXERCISE" by surrender to the Issuer for cancellation of a portion of
this Warrant representing that number of unissued shares of Warrant Stock which
is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product obtained by
multiplying the Warrant Price by the number of shares of Warrant Stock being
purchased upon such exercise by (B) the Per Share Market Value as of the date of
such exercise, or (iii) by a combination of the foregoing methods of payment
selected by the Holder of this Warrant; provided, however, that the "cashless
exercise" method shall not be available before December 23, 2006. In any case
where the consideration payable upon such exercise is being paid in whole or in
part pursuant to the provisions of clause (ii) of this subsection (b), such
exercise shall be accompanied by written notice from the Holder of this Warrant
specifying the manner of payment thereof and containing a calculation showing
the number of shares of Warrant Stock with respect to which rights are being
surrendered thereunder and the net number of shares to be issued after giving
effect to such surrender.

         (c) ISSUANCE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES. In the event of any exercise of the
rights represented by this Warrant in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, (i) certificates for the shares of Warrant Stock so
purchased shall be dated the date of such exercise (if the deliveries required
to be made by the Holder pursuant to SECTION 2(b) are received by the Issuer
prior to 5:00 p.m. eastern time on the exercise date) and delivered to the
Holder hereof within a reasonable time, not exceeding three (3) Trading Days
after such exercise, and the Holder hereof shall be deemed for all purposes to
be the Holder of the shares of Warrant Stock so purchased as of the date of such
exercise, and (ii) unless this Warrant has expired, a new Warrant representing
the number of shares of Warrant Stock, if any, with respect to which this
Warrant shall not then have been exercised (less any amount thereof which shall
have been canceled in payment or partial payment of the Warrant Price as
hereinabove provided) shall also be issued to the Holder hereof at the Issuer's
expense within such time or as soon as practicable thereafter.

         (d) TRANSFERABILITY OF WARRANT. Subject to SECTION 2(e), this Warrant
may be transferred by a Holder without the consent of the Issuer. If transferred
pursuant to this paragraph and subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of
this SECTION 2, this Warrant may be transferred on the books of the Issuer by
the Holder hereof in person or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of
this Warrant at the principal office of the Issuer, properly endorsed (by the
Holder executing an assignment in the form attached hereto) and upon payment of
any necessary transfer tax or other governmental charge imposed upon such
transfer. This Warrant is exchangeable at the principal office of the Issuer for
Warrants for the purchase of the same aggregate number of shares of Warrant
Stock, each new Warrant to represent the right to purchase such number of shares
of Warrant Stock as the Holder hereof shall designate at the time of such
exchange. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the
Original Issue Date and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the
number of shares of Warrant Stock issuable pursuant hereto.

         (e) COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS.

                  (i) The Holder of this Warrant, by acceptance hereof,
         acknowledges that this Warrant or the shares of Warrant Stock to be
         issued upon exercise hereof are being acquired solely for the Holder's
         own account and not as a nominee for any other party, and for
         investment, and that the Holder will not offer, sell or otherwise
         dispose of this Warrant or any shares of Warrant Stock to be issued
         upon exercise hereof except pursuant to an effective registration
         statement, or an exemption from registration, under the Securities Act
         and any applicable state securities laws.

                  (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (iii) below, this Warrant
         and all certificates representing shares of Warrant Stock issued upon
         exercise hereof shall be stamped or imprinted with a legend in
         substantially the following form:

                           THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE
                           UPON EXERCISE HEREOF HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
                           THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
                           "SECURITIES ACT") OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND
                           MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
                           UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND UNDER
                           APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR TELENETICS
                           CORPORATION SHALL HAVE RECEIVED AN OPINION OF ITS
                           COUNSEL THAT REGISTRATION OF SUCH SECURITIES UNDER
                           THE SECURITIES ACT AND UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF
                           APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS IS NOT REQUIRED.

                  (iii) The restrictions imposed by this subsection (e) upon the
         transfer of this Warrant or the shares of Warrant Stock to be purchased
         upon exercise hereof shall terminate (A) when such securities shall
         have been resold pursuant to an effective registration statement under
         the Securities Act, (B) upon the Issuer's receipt of an opinion of
         counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer,
         addressed to the Issuer to the effect that such restrictions are no
         longer required to ensure compliance with the Securities Act and state
         securities laws, or (C) upon the Issuer's receipt of other evidence
         reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer that such registration and
         qualification under the Securities Act and state securities laws are
         not required. Whenever such restrictions shall cease and terminate as
         to any such securities, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
         from the Issuer (or its transfer agent and registrar), without expense
         (other than applicable transfer taxes, if any), new Warrants (or, in
         the case of shares of Warrant Stock, new stock certificates) of like
         tenor not bearing the applicable legend required by paragraph (ii)
         above relating to the Securities Act and state securities laws.

                                      -3-


<PAGE>

         (f) CONTINUING RIGHTS OF HOLDER. The Issuer will, at the time of or at
any time after each exercise of this Warrant, upon the request of the Holder
hereof, acknowledge in writing the extent, if any, of its continuing obligation
to afford to such Holder all rights to which such Holder shall continue to be
entitled after such exercise in accordance with the terms of this Warrant,
provided that if any such Holder shall fail to make any such request, the
failure shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Issuer to afford such
rights to such Holder.

3.       STOCK FULLY PAID; RESERVATION AND LISTING OF SHARES; COVENANTS.

         (a) STOCK FULLY PAID. The Issuer represents, warrants, covenants and
agrees that all shares of Warrant Stock which may be issued upon the exercise of
this Warrant or otherwise hereunder will, upon issuance, be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens and
charges created by or through Issuer. The Issuer further covenants and agrees
that during the period within which this Warrant may be exercised, the Issuer
will at all times have authorized and reserved for the purpose of the issue upon
exercise of this Warrant a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to
provide for the exercise of this Warrant.

         (b) RESERVATION. If any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved
for issuance upon exercise of this Warrant or as otherwise provided hereunder
require registration or qualification with any governmental authority under any
federal or state law before such shares may be so issued, the Issuer will in
good faith use its best efforts as expeditiously as possible at its expense to
cause such shares to be duly registered or qualified. If the Issuer shall list
any shares of Common Stock on any securities exchange or market it will, at its
expense, list thereon, maintain and increase when necessary such listing, of,
all shares of Warrant Stock from time to time issued upon exercise of this
Warrant or as otherwise provided hereunder, and, to the extent permissible under
the applicable securities exchange rules, all unissued shares of Warrant Stock
which are at any time issuable hereunder, so long as any shares of Common Stock
shall be so listed. The Issuer will also so list on each securities exchange or
market, and will maintain such listing of, any other securities which the Holder
of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this Warrant
if at the time any and for so long as securities of the same class shall be
listed on such securities exchange or market by the Issuer.

         (c) COVENANTS. The Issuer shall not by any action including, without
limitation, amending the Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Issuer,
or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and
in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect
the rights of the Holder hereof against dilution (to the extent specifically
provided herein) or impairment. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Issuer will (i) not permit the par value, if any, of its Common
Stock to exceed the then effective Warrant Price, (ii) take all such action as
may be reasonably necessary in order that the Issuer may validly and legally
issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, free and clear of any
liens, claims, encumbrances and restrictions (other than as provided herein)
upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain all
such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body
having jurisdiction thereof as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Issuer
to perform its obligations under this Warrant.

                                      -4-


<PAGE>

         (d) LOSS, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OF WARRANTS. Upon receipt of evidence
satisfactory to the Issuer of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation of any Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or
destruction, upon receipt of indemnity or security satisfactory to the Issuer
or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such
Warrant, the Issuer will make and deliver, in lieu of such lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and representing the
right to purchase the same number of shares of Common Stock.

         (e) REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The Warrant Stock is entitled to the benefits
of and subject to the obligations relating to those certain registration rights
expressly set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

4.       ADJUSTMENT OF WARRANT PRICE AND WARRANT SHARE NUMBER.

         The Warrant Price shall be adjusted as set forth in this SECTION 4.
Upon each adjustment to the Warrant Price pursuant to this SECTION 4, the Holder
shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant, at the
Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares of Common
Stock obtained by (i) multiplying the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior
to such adjustment by the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder
immediately prior to such adjustment, and (ii) dividing the product thereof by
the Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment. The Issuer shall give the
Holder notice of any event described below which requires an adjustment pursuant
to this SECTION 4 in accordance with SECTION 5.

         (a) The Warrant Price shall be further adjusted as follows:

                  (i) In the case of any amendment to the Issuer's Articles of
         Incorporation to change the designation of the Common Stock or the
         rights, privileges, restrictions or conditions with respect to the
         Common Stock or division of the Common Stock, this Warrant shall be
         adjusted so as to provide that upon exercise thereof, the Holder shall
         receive, in lieu of each share of Common Stock theretofore issuable
         upon such exercise, the kind and amount of shares, other securities,
         money and property receivable upon such designation, change or division
         by the Holder issuable upon such exercise had the exercise occurred
         immediately prior to such designation, change or division. This Warrant
         shall be deemed thereafter to provide for adjustments that shall be as
         nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for
         in this SECTION 4. The provisions of this SUBSECTION 4(a)(i) shall
         apply in the same manner to successive reclassifications, changes,
         consolidations and mergers.

                  (ii) If the Issuer shall at any time subdivide its outstanding
         shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock,
         or declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon the Common
         Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Price in effect
         immediately prior to such subdivision or dividend or other distribution
         shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the
         outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller
         number of shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Price in effect
         immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
         increased.

                                      -5-


<PAGE>

                  (iii) If any capital reorganization or reclassification of the
         capital stock of the Issuer, or any consolidation or merger of the
         Issuer with or into another corporation or other entity, or the sale of
         all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets to another corporation
         or other entity shall be effected in such a way that holders of shares
         of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities, other
         evidence of equity ownership or assets with respect to or in exchange
         for shares of Common Stock, then, as a condition of such
         reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale (except
         as otherwise provided below in this SECTION 4), lawful and adequate
         provisions shall be made whereby the Holder shall thereafter have the
         right to receive upon the exercise hereof upon the basis and upon the
         terms and conditions specified herein, such shares of stock,
         securities, other evidence of equity ownership or assets as may be
         issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of
         outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares
         of Common Stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon
         the exercise of this Warrant under this SECTION 4 had such
         reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale not
         taken place, and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made
         with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder to the end that
         the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for
         adjustments of the Warrant Price and of the number of shares of Common
         Stock receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall thereafter be
         applicable, as nearly as may be practicable, in relation to any shares
         of stock, securities, other evidence of equity ownership or assets
         thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. Subject to the terms
         of this Warrant, in the event of a merger or consolidation of the
         Company with or into another corporation or other entity as a result of
         which the number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation
         or other entity issuable to holders of Common Stock, is greater or
         lesser than the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
         immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, then the Warrant
         Price in effect immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall
         be adjusted in the same manner as though there were a subdivision or
         combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.

                  (iv) In case the Issuer shall, at any time prior to exercise
         of this Warrant, consolidate or merge with any other corporation or
         other entity (where the Issuer is not the surviving entity) or transfer
         all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or
         other entity, then the Issuer shall, as a condition precedent to such
         transaction, cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of
         this Warrant upon the exercise of this Warrant after the effective date
         of such transaction shall be entitled to receive the kind and amount of
         shares, evidences of indebtedness and/or other securities or property
         receivable on such transaction by a holder of the number of shares of
         Common Stock as to which this Warrant was exercisable immediately prior
         to such transaction (without giving effect to any restriction upon such
         exercise); and, in any such case, appropriate provision shall be made
         with respect to the rights and interest of the Holder of this Warrant
         to the end that the provisions of this Warrant shall thereafter be
         applicable (as nearly as may be practicable) with respect to any
         shares, evidences of indebtedness or other securities or assets
         thereafter deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant.

                                      -6-


<PAGE>

                  (v) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued in
         connection with any exercise of this Warrant, but in lieu of such
         fractional shares, the Issuer shall make a cash payment therefor equal
         in amount to the product of the applicable fraction multiplied by the
         Warrant Price then in effect.

         (b) OTHER PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ADJUSTMENTS UNDER THIS SECTION. The
following provisions shall be applicable to the making of adjustments of the
number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable and the
Warrant Price then in effect provided for in this SECTION 4:

                  (i) WHEN ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE. The adjustments required by
         this SECTION 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified
         event requiring an adjustment shall occur, except that any adjustment
         of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is
         exercisable that would otherwise be required may be postponed (except
         in the case of a subdivision or combination of shares of the Common
         Stock, as provided for in SECTION 4(a)(ii)) up to, but not beyond the
         date of exercise if such adjustment either by itself or with other
         adjustments not previously made adds or subtracts less than one percent
         (1%) of the shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is
         exercisable immediately prior to the making of such adjustment. Any
         adjustment representing a change of less than such minimum amount
         (except as aforesaid) which is postponed shall be carried forward and
         made as soon as such adjustment, together with other adjustments
         required by this SECTION 4 and not previously made, would result in a
         minimum adjustment or on the date of exercise. For the purpose of any
         adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the
         close of business on the date of its occurrence.

                  (ii) FRACTIONAL INTERESTS. In computing adjustments under this
         SECTION 4, fractional interests in Common Stock shall be taken into
         account to the nearest one one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share.

                  (iii) WHEN ADJUSTMENT NOT REQUIRED. If the Issuer shall take a
         record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling
         them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase
         rights and shall, thereafter and before the distribution to
         stockholders thereof, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such
         dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then
         thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of
         such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof
         shall be rescinded and annulled.

         (c) FORM OF WARRANT AFTER ADJUSTMENTS. The form of this Warrant need
not be changed because of any adjustments in the Warrant Price or the number and
kind of Securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant.

5.       NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS.

         Whenever the Warrant Price or Warrant Share Number shall be adjusted
pursuant to SECTION 4 or SECTION 8 hereof (for purposes of this SECTION 5, each
an "ADJUSTMENT"), the Issuer shall cause its Chief Financial Officer to prepare
and execute a certificate setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event
requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such

                                      -7-


<PAGE>

adjustment was calculated (including a description of the basis on which the
Board made any determination hereunder), and the Warrant Price and, in the case
of an adjustment pursuant to SECTION 4, the Warrant Share Number, after giving
effect to such adjustment, and shall cause copies of such certificate to be
delivered to the Holder of this Warrant after each adjustment.

6.       FRACTIONAL SHARES.

         No fractional shares of Warrant Stock will be issued in connection with
an exercise hereof, but in lieu of such fractional shares, the Issuer shall make
a cash payment therefor equal in amount to the product of the applicable
fraction multiplied by the Per Share Market Value then in effect.

7.       OWNERSHIP CAP AND CERTAIN EXERCISE RESTRICTIONS.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Warrant,
at no time may a holder of this Warrant exercise this Warrant if the number of
shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to such exercise would exceed, when
aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such
holder at such time, the number of shares of Common Stock which would result in
such holder beneficially owning more than 4.999% of all of the Common Stock
outstanding at such time; provided, however, that upon a holder of this Warrant
providing the Issuer with sixty (60) days notice (pursuant to SECTION 13 hereof)
(the "WAIVER NOTICE") that such holder would like to waive this SECTION 7(a)
with regard to any or all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant, this SECTION 7(a) will be of no force or effect with regard to all or a
portion of the Warrant referenced in the Waiver Notice.

         (b) The Holder may not exercise the Warrant hereunder to the extent
such exercise would result in the Holder beneficially owning (as determined in
accordance with SECTION 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder) in
excess of 9.999% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock,
including shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant held by the Holder after
application of this Section.

8.       ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO WARRANT PRICE.

         The Warrant Price shall be adjusted as set forth in Section 2 of the
Registration Rights Agreement.

9.       DEFINITIONS.

         For the purposes of this Warrant, the following terms have the
following meanings:
