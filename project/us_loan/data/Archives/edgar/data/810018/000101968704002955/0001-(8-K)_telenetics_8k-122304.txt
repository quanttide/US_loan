ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 23, 2004, 18 accredited investors ("Investors") purchased
from Telenetics Corporation an aggregate of 15,285,715 shares of Telenetics
common stock at a price of $0.07 per share in a private placement transaction
pursuant to the terms of a Common Stock Purchase Agreement and a Registration
Rights Agreement. The Investors included Gary Arnold, the Chairman of the Board
of Telenetics; William Kosoff, a director and Vice President of Sales of
Telenetics; Michael N. Taglich, the former Chairman of the Board of Telenetics
and a 5% owner of Telenetics common stock; Barry G. Patton, an officer of Data
Connect Enterprise, Inc., which is a major distributor of Telenetics products;
John G. Funk, who is an executive officer of Skyline Exhibits, a company that
has supplied trade show booths to Telenetics; and Meadowbrook Opportunity Fund
LLC, an entity that became a 5% owner of Telenetics common stock upon the
closing of the offering.

         Taglich Brothers, Inc., an NASD-registered broker-dealer, acted as
placement agent in connection with the offering. Michael N. Taglich is an
executive officer, principal and director of Taglich Brothers. Also, Robert
Schroeder, one of Telenetics' current directors, is employed by Taglich
Brothers. Telenetics paid to Taglich Brothers cash placement agent fees equal to
$90,000 and issued to Taglich Brothers, Inc. five-year placement warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 1,428,571 shares of Telenetics common stock at an
exercise price of $0.125 per share, which price was 125% of the closing sale
price of Telenetics common Stock on the closing date. In addition, Telenetics
agreed to reimburse Taglich Brothers for its actual and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the offering, which expenses are
anticipated to be less than $1,000. Taglich Brothers expects to allocate the
placement warrants among its employees, including Michael N. Taglich (as to
266,785) and Robert Schroeder (as to 300,000). The placement warrants contain a
"net exercise" cashless exercise feature that will become available December 23,
2006.

         Telenetics has agreed to indemnify Taglich Brothers in connection with
statements or omissions in the offering documents. Taglich Brothers has agreed
to indemnify Telenetics in connection with any breach or falsity of any of
Taglich Brothers' representations or warrants or otherwise arising out of the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Taglich Brothers. In
addition, the Registration Rights Agreement contains mutual indemnification
provisions relating to the registration statement described below.

         Telenetics has agreed to register for resale the shares of common stock
issued to the Investors and the shares of common stock underlying the placement
warrants. The registration statement must be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by April 30, 2005 and declared effective no later than June
30, 2005. If Telenetics fails to meet these registration obligations or to
maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement as required under the
terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, then Telenetics will be obligated to
make certain cash liquidated damage payments to the Investors and to reduce the
exercise price of the placement warrants as generally described below.

         If the registration statement is not filed on or prior to April 30,
2005, then for each 30-day period, or any part thereof, that elapses beyond that
date and before the registration statement is filed, Telenetics will pay a cash
liquidated damages payment to each Investor in an amount equal to 3% of the
purchase price paid by the Investor and, as liquidated damages, reduce the
exercise price of each placement warrant by 3% of the initial exercise price. If
the registration statement is not declared effective on or before June 30, 2005,
then for each 30-day period, or any part thereof, that elapses beyond June 30,
2005 and before the registration statement is declared effective, Telenetics
will pay a cash liquidated damages payment to each Investor in an amount equal
to 2% of the purchase price paid by the Investor and, as liquidated damages,
reduce the exercise price of each placement warrant by an amount equal to 2% of
the initial exercise price of the placement warrant. If Telenetics is unable to
keep the registration statement continuously effective to the extent required,
then similar monthly cash payments of 2% to Investors and placement agent
exercise price reductions of 2% will be required for shares then held by
Investors and placement warrants then outstanding. The maximum aggregate cash
liquidated damages payment and/or the maximum aggregate liquidated damages
placement warrant exercise price reduction is 36%.

ITEM 3.02.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         As described in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K, Telenetics issued shares of
common stock and placement warrants in connection with the private placement
transaction on December 23, 2004. The disclosures in Item 1.01 are incorporated
herein by reference.

         Exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 for the transaction described above is claimed under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, among others, on the basis that such transaction did not
involve any public offering and the purchasers were accredited and had access to
the kind of information registration would provide. Appropriate investment
representations were obtained, and the securities were issued with restricted
securities legends.
