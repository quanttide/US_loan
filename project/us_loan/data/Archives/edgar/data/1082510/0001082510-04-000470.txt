                      UIL Announces Finance Reorganization
                      ------------------------------------

         UIL Holdings Corporation (NYSE: UIL) today announced a reorganization
of its Finance organization to reduce costs, improve process flow and better
support its core utility operations.

         Following the sale of American Payment Systems, Inc. (APS) earlier this
year, the strategic core of UIL Holdings has returned to its utility operations
along with Xcelecom, its specialty electrical contracting business. Accounting,
treasury and corporate planning functions, which are currently based in the
holding company, will be combined with similar functions in the Company's
utility subsidiary, The United Illuminating Company (UI).

         After spearheading this reorganization of the Finance department,
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Louis Paglia will leave the
company in 2005 after the filing of 2004 financial statements. Charles Pepe,
Treasurer of UIL Holdings will retire in 2005 following the reorganization.

           "On behalf of the Board of Directors and management of UIL Holdings
I want to thank Lou Paglia for the leadership he has provided to the strategic
and financial direction of the Company over the past several years. He has
dramatically improved financial controls, strengthened the balance sheet and
directed the sale of APS. Through all of these contributions and more, Lou has
enhanced the Company's future prospects," said Nat Woodson, Chairman of the
Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of UIL Holdings.

          "During Charlie Pepe's 26 years with the Company," Woodson added, "he
has superbly managed its financial assets. He guided the Company through
volatile financial markets and demanding generating plant construction cycles,
always maintaining liquidity and access to financial markets. Charlie has
managed over $3 billion in equity and debt financings in his career to support
the Company's operations. Through his efforts, UIL Holdings is well positioned
today to support the growth of its operating businesses. We thank Charlie for
his contributions over the years to our business and community."

                                NEW APPOINTMENTS

                               IMPACT ON EARNINGS
                               ------------------

         As a result of expenses associated with this reorganization, UIL is
revising its previous earnings range estimate for 2004 to $2.30 - $2.45 per
share, down from the previous range estimate of $2.40 - $2.60 per share.
