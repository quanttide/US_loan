Light and Power Company (CL&P) announcing revisions to the cost estimates and
schedule for their Middletown/Norwalk Transmission Project. A copy of the joint
UI/CL&P press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and hereby incorporated
by reference.

should be reviewed in the Registrant's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K
and other subsequent periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Forward-looking statements included in the press release attached
hereto as Exhibit 99 speak only as of the date of the press release and the
Registrant undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements to
reflect events or circumstances after the date of the press release or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances.
