         BERLIN and NEW HAVEN, Connecticut, December 28, 2004 - It will cost an
estimated $840 million to $990 million to build Connecticut Light & Power's
(CL&P) and United Illuminating's (UI) proposed Middletown/Norwalk Transmission
Project, according to a filing today with the Connecticut Siting Council. The
expansion of the electrical grid is needed to help meet the current and future
energy needs of southwest Connecticut and the region.

         The cost estimate has been updated to reflect current costs associated
with changes needed to address technical issues introduced by the extensive
amount of underground transmission being proposed (45 miles of overhead and 24
miles of underground construction) and a two-year delay in the project
in-service date from 2007 to 2009. The variation in the cost range is due to
unknown soil and rock conditions that may be encountered during construction
and a provision for other contingencies. The low end of the new estimate is
more than $200 million higher than originally estimated in the companies' 2003
application. Additional steps to lower magnetic fields along the overhead
portion of the proposed route would add between $70 million and $80 million to
the estimated cost.

         The filing also says that two other alternatives would cost less than
the proposed route. These alternatives are more controversial locally as they
rely on more miles of overhead construction. The first alternative would
involve installing 60 miles overhead and 13 miles underground and would cost
and estimated $810 million to $950 million. The second alternative would
involve installing 72 miles overhead and four miles underground at an estimated
cost of $750 million to $860 million.

          "Last week, the companies provided the Connecticut Siting Council
with three reliable alternatives to meet the area's electric needs," said
Anthony Vallillo, UI's president and chief operating officer. "This filing
provides the costs of each alternative, so the Siting Council can make a fully
informed decision."

         "While everyone acknowledges the urgent need for the project, the
current debate is focused on how much of the line should be buried," said David
H. Boguslawski, CL&P's vice president, transmission business. "We stand ready
to build any of the technically feasible alternatives."

           Today's filing updates cost estimates necessitated by project
changes recommended last week by the Reliability and Operability Committee
(ROC). The committee, composed of representatives of CL&P, UI and ISO New
England, announced that it, and its consultants, reached a consensus that
installing 24 miles of underground cable will work, as part of the proposed
69 mile route. The committee also reported it cannot support undergrounding
beyond the 24 miles because additional underground cable introduces
unacceptable risks to the integrity and reliability of the grid. The ROC was
created in June 2004 after concerns were raised about maximizing the use of
underground cable in the Middletown/Norwalk Project.

         The Connecticut Siting Council is scheduled to hold hearings on the
proposal and the alternatives on January 11 and 13, 2005. A ruling on the
proposed project is expected by April 7, 2005.
