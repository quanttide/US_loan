ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY  INTO  A  MATERIAL  DEFINITIVE  AGREEMENT.

     On December 23, 2004, Concurrent Computer Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company" or the "Registrant"), executed a Loan and Security
Agreement by and between Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank") and the Company (the
"Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a two year $10,000,000
revolving credit line (the "Revolver") and a three year $3,000,000 term loan
(the "Term Loan") and also provides that substantially all of the assets of the
Company will secure the Company's obligations to the Bank thereunder, including
the stock of three of the Company's domestic subsidiaries. The Revolver expires
on December 23, 2006, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms,
and the Term Loan expires on December 23, 2007, unless terminated earlier in
accordance with its terms. As of the date of closing of the Credit Agreement,
the Company had no amounts drawn under the Revolver and had drawn down the
entire $3,000,000 under the Term Loan.

     Interest on all outstanding amounts under the Revolver is payable monthly
at the Bank's prime rate (5.25% at December 23, 2004) plus 3.25% per annum, and
interest on all outstanding amounts under the Term Loan is payable monthly at a
rate of 8% per annum. The Term Loan is repayable in 36 equal monthly principal
and interest installments of $93,701.40 and the outstanding principal of the
Revolver is due on December 23, 2006, unless the Revolver is terminated earlier
in accordance with its terms.

     In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants,
including required financial ratios and a minimum tangible net worth, and
customary restrictive covenants concerning the Company's operations.

            OFF-BALANCE  SHEET  ARRANGEMENT  OF  A  REGISTRANT.
