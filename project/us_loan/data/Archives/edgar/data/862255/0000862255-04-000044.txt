                                    ARTICLE 3
                                 PURCHASE PRICE

         3.1      Purchase Price.

                  (a) Concurrently herewith and in consideration for the
Acquired Assets to be sold and transferred to Buyer, Buyer shall pay or cause to
be paid to Seller, $2,532,383.00 (the "Purchase Price"). Buyer is concurrently
paying $2,432,383.00 of the Purchase Price to Seller in immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller. Buyer shall pay (i)
$50,000 of the remaining $100,000 of the Purchase Price (the "Warranty Holdback
Amount") to Buyer as provided in Section 3.1(b) below, and (ii) the other
$50,000 of the remaining $100,000 of the Purchase Price (the "Receivables
Holdback Amount") to Buyer as provided in Section 3.1(c) below.

                  (b) Within five (5) days after the expiration of the one
hundred eighty (180) day period following the date hereof (such 180-day period,
the "Holdback Period"), Buyer shall notify Seller, in writing, of the total
dollar amount of product warranty claims or returns received by Buyer during the
Holdback Period, relating to products manufactured and sold on or before the
date hereof (the "Warranty Amount"). Such notice shall describe with reasonable
detail such warranty claims. If the Warranty Holdback Amount is greater than the
Warranty Amount, concurrently with the delivery of such notice, Buyer shall
deliver the difference between the Warranty Holdback Amount and the Warranty
Amount to Seller by check. Seller shall be permitted to review (during regular
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice) the records and working papers
of Buyer and (where applicable) Buyer's accountants relating to the matters set
forth in such notice and to challenge the Warranty Amount in the manner
described in Section 3.2 below with respect to a challenge of the Post-Closing
Delivery by Buyer.

                  (c) Within five (5) days after the expiration of the Holdback
Period, Buyer shall notify Seller, in writing, of the total dollar amount of
Accounts Receivable which during the Holdback Period become more than 100 days
past due (the "Delinquent Accounts Receivable"). Such notice shall describe with
reasonable detail such Delinquent Accounts Receivable. If the Receivables
Holdback Amount is greater than the Delinquent Accounts Receivable, concurrently
with the delivery of such notice, Buyer shall deliver the difference between the
Receivables Holdback Amount and the Delinquent Accounts Receivable to Seller by
check. Further, concurrently with such notice, Buyer shall execute and deliver
an assignment of the Delinquent Accounts Receivable to Seller, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E. Seller shall be permitted to review (during
regular business hours and upon reasonable prior notice) the records and working
papers of Buyer and (where applicable) Buyer's accountants relating to the
matters set forth in such notice and to challenge the collection of the
Delinquent Accounts Receivable in the manner described in Section 3.2 below with
respect to a challenge of the Post-Closing Delivery by Buyer. For purposes of
determining whether an Account Receivable has been paid during the Holdback
Period, all amounts paid during the Holdback Period by any Person in respect of
an Account Receivable (or an account receivable generated by Buyer after the
date hereof) shall be first applied to the most delinquent Accounts Receivable,
until the amount of such payment is fully utilized.

                  (d) Within five (5) business days after the end of each
calendar month between the date hereof and the expiration of the Holdback
Period, Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of the then current aggregate
amount of each of the Warranty Amount and Delinquent Accounts Receivable, if
any. Such writing shall describe with reasonable detail all warranty claims and
Delinquent Accounts Receivable.

         3.2      Purchase Price Adjustment.

                  (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
         hereof, and in any event not later than thirty (30) days hereafter,
         Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (such delivery, the
         "Post-Closing Delivery"):

                           (i) a balance sheet of Seller (without giving effect
                  to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
                  prepared as of the close of business on the date hereof in
                  accordance with GAAP (it being agreed that if GAAP permits
                  different methods of preparing any item on the Closing Date
                  Balance Sheet, the methodology used in the Financial
                  Statements with respect to such item shall be used with
                  respect to such item in the preparation of the Closing Date
                  Balance Sheet) (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"); provided,
                  however, that the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not contain
                  a reserve or an allowance for customer returns, bad debt
                  and/or warranty claims (it being the intention of the parties
                  that matters relating thereto be exclusively paid from the
                  Holdback Amount, with any excess to be assumed by Buyer); and

                           (ii) a calculation of the working capital of Seller
                  as of the close of business on the date hereof (the "Closing
                  Date Working Capital"). The Closing Date Working Capital shall
                  be an amount equal to the difference between Seller's Current
                  Assets and Current Liabilities. If Current Assets exceed
                  Current Liabilities, Closing Date Working Capital shall be a
                  positive number. If Current Liabilities exceed Current Assets,
                  Closing Date Working Capital shall be a negative number. It is
                  the intention of the parties that Closing Date Working Capital
                  be calculated consistently with the calculation of Base
                  Working Capital on Exhibit A hereto.

         Buyer shall be entitled to observe and participate in, and provide
         consultation with respect to, the preparation of the Post-Closing
         Delivery.

                  (b) Buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the date Seller
         makes the Post-Closing Delivery (such period, the "Dispute Period") to
         notify Buyer, in writing, as to whether Buyer agrees or disagrees with
         the Post-Closing Delivery (such written notice, the "Dispute Notice").
         During the Dispute Period, Buyer and its accountants shall be permitted
         to review (during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior
         notice) the working papers of Seller and (where applicable) Seller's
         accountants relating to the matters set forth in the Post-Closing
         Delivery.

                  (c) If Buyer fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller
         during the Dispute Period, (i) the Closing Date Balance Sheet as
         prepared by Seller shall be deemed to have been correctly prepared, and
         (ii) Seller's calculation of Closing Date Working Capital shall be
         deemed to be final and correct and shall be binding upon each of the
         parties hereto.

                  (d) If Buyer delivers a Dispute Notice to Seller during the
         Dispute Period, Seller and Buyer shall, for a period of thirty (30)
         days from the date the Dispute Notice is delivered to Buyer (such
         period, the "Resolution Period"), use their respective best efforts to
         amicably resolve the items in dispute. Any items so resolved by the
         parties shall be deemed to be final and correct as so resolved and
         shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto.

                  (e) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all of the items
         in dispute during the Resolution Period, then either Buyer or Seller
         may refer the items remaining in dispute to the Independent
         Accountants. Such referral shall be made in writing to the Independent
         Accountants, copies of which shall concurrently be delivered to the
         non-referring party hereto. The referring party shall furnish the
         Independent Accountants, at the time of such referral, with the
         Post-Closing Delivery and the Dispute Notice. The parties shall also
         furnish the Independent Accountants with such other information and
         documents as the Independent Accountants may reasonably request in
         order for them to resolve the items in dispute. The parties hereto
         shall also, within ten (10) days of the date the items in dispute are
         referred to the Independent Accountants, provide the Independent
         Accountants with a written notice (a "Position Statement") describing
         in reasonable detail their respective positions on the items in dispute
         (copies of which will concurrently be delivered to the other party
         hereto). If any party fails to timely deliver its Position Statement to
         the Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall resolve
         the items in dispute solely upon the basis of the information otherwise
         provided to them. The Independent Accountants shall resolve all
         disputed items in a written determination to be delivered to each of
         the parties hereto within thirty (30) days after such matter is
         referred to them; provided, however, that any delay in delivering such
         determination shall not invalidate such determination or deprive the
         Independent Accountants of jurisdiction to resolve the items in
         dispute. The decision of the Independent Accountants as to the items in
         dispute shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and shall
         not be subject to judicial review. The fees and expenses of the
         Independent Accountants incurred in the resolution of any items in
         dispute shall be determined by the Independent Accountants and set
         forth in their report and shall be allocated and paid one-half (1/2) by
         Buyer and one-half (1/2) by Seller.

                  (f) Within five (5) days after the final determination of the
         Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Date Working
         Capital (whether through failure of Buyer to timely deliver a Dispute
         Notice, agreement of the parties, or determination of the Independent
         Accountants):

                           (i) if Closing Date Working Capital is less than Base
                  Working Capital, Seller shall pay Buyer the difference, or

                           (ii) if Closing Date Working Capital is more than
                  Base Working Capital, Buyer shall pay Seller the excess.

         All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
         available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
         Seller or Buyer, as appropriate, which designation shall be made by the
         party receiving such payment no later than one (1) business day prior
         to the payment date.

                  (g) Within ten (10) days after the date hereof, Seller shall
         deliver to Buyer a written statement setting forth the actual amount
         accrued as of the date hereof on its books and records for 401(k)
         accruals and vacation pay accruals (such actual accrued amount, in the
         aggregate, the "Actual 401(k) and Vacation Accrual Amount"). If the
         Actual 401(k) and Vacation Accrual Amount is more than the Estimated
         401(k) and Vacation Accrual Amount, Buyer shall pay Seller the excess.
         If the Actual 401(k) and Vacation Accrual Amount is less than the
         Estimated 401(k) and Vacation Accrual Amount, Seller shall pay Buyer
         the excess. All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section
         3.2(g) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
         an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller or Buyer, as
         appropriate, which designation shall be made by the party receiving
         such payment no later than one (1) business day prior to the payment
         date.

         3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price, as adjusted,
shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets according to the methodology set
forth in Exhibit F hereto. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall take a position on any
tax return (including, without limitation, IRS Form 8594, and any amendments
thereto), before any governmental agency charged with the collection of any tax,
or in any proceeding that is inconsistent with such allocation (taking into
account any subsequent amendments required by law) or otherwise inconsistent
with this Exhibit F without the prior written consent of the other party hereto.
Seller and Buyer shall make their respective IRS Forms 8594 (and any amendments
thereto) filed or to be filed with the IRS available for inspection by the other
party for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Exhibit F.

                  requirements of sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code.

                           (viii) None of the assets of any Benefit Plan are
                  invested in employer securities or employer real property.

                           (ix) There has not been any "prohibited transaction"
                  (as described in section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the

                  related charges under sections 502(c), 502(i) or 4071 of ERISA
                  or Chapters 43, 47, or 68 of the Code for which Seller may be
                  liable.

                           (xi) None of the payments contemplated by the Benefit
                  Plans would, in the aggregate, constitute excess parachute
                  payments as defined in section 280G of the Code (without
                  regard to subsection (b)(4) thereof).

                           (xii) No Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan.

                           (xiii) Each Benefit Plan which constitutes a "group

                  4980B(g)(2) of the Code), including any plans of current and
                  former Affiliates which must be taken into account under
                  section 4980B and 414(t) of the Code or section 601 of ERISA,

                           (xv) Seller has no liability or contingent liability
                  under any Benefit Plan for providing post-retirement medical
                  or life insurance benefits, other than statutory liability for
                  providing group health plan continuation coverage under Part 6
                  of Title I of ERISA and section 4980B or former section 162(k)
                  of the Code.

                           (xvi) Except as provided in the Canadian CBA, the
                  Canadian Retirement Plan and the Canadian Welfare Plan, or by
                  operation of Law, there has been no act or omission by Seller
                  that would impair the right or ability of Buyer to
                  unilaterally amend or terminate any Benefit Plan.

                  (p) Intellectual Property. Schedule 4.1(p) hereto lists all
         Intellectual Property. All of the registered Intellectual Property is
         registered in Seller's name, is in material compliance with formal
         legal requirements and is valid and enforceable in all material
         respects. To the Knowledge of Seller, none of the registered
         Intellectual Property is currently involved in any interference,
         reissue, reexamination, or opposition proceeding. To the Knowledge of
         Seller, there is no intellectual property of any third party that
         infringes any of the Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Seller,
         none of the Intellectual Property infringes any intellectual property
         right of any other Person.

                  (q) Affiliate Transactions. Neither Seller nor any of its
         Affiliates currently owns a material equity interest in any Person that
         (and none of Seller's Affiliates) (i) has had material business
         dealings with Seller, other than business dealings or transactions
         disclosed in Schedule 4.1(q) hereto, each of which has been conducted
         in the ordinary course of business at substantially prevailing market
         prices and on substantially prevailing market terms, or (ii) is
         currently engaged in direct competition with Seller. Seller has no
         subsidiaries or any equity investment in any joint venture or any other
         Person not a party to this Agreement.

                  (r) Broker's Fees. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1(r)
         hereto, Seller has no liability or obligation to pay any fees or
         commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  such customer during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.
                  To the Knowledge of Seller, no customer listed in Schedule
                  4.1(s)(i) hereto has terminated its business relationship with
                  Seller or has materially reduced (or has informed Seller in
                  writing that it intends to materially reduce) the volume of
                  goods or services it is currently purchasing from the level of
                  goods or services purchased by such customer historically.

                           (ii) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1(s)(ii)
                  hereto, there are no suppliers of products or services to
                  Seller which are material and with respect to which practical
                  alternative sources of supply are not generally available to
                  Seller on comparable terms and conditions in the marketplace.
                  To the Knowledge of Seller, none of the suppliers listed in
                  Schedule 4.1(s)(ii) hereto has indicated in writing its
                  intention to terminate its business relationship with Seller,
                  materially reduce the level of products or services supplied
                  to Seller from historic levels, or materially change the price
                  or terms on which such products or services are sold to
                  Seller.

                  (t) Schedules. The information set forth in the Schedules to
         this Agreement is correct and complete in all material respects.

         4.2 DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.1 ABOVE, SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF ANY OF ITS

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         5.1 Indemnification by Seller. Subject to Section 5.3 below, Seller and
Parent shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Buyer against any and all Losses
arising directly out of (a) any inaccuracy of a representation or warranty made
by Seller in this Agreement or any other agreement, certificate, document or
instrument executed in connection herewith, including, without limitation, the
Real Estate Agreements, (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by
Seller in this Agreement or any other agreement, certificate, document or
instrument executed in connection herewith, including, without limitation, the
Real Estate Agreements, (c) any of the Excluded Liabilities, and (d) Seller's
failure to comply with applicable bulk sales laws in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent the
liabilities associated therewith are Assumed Liabilities).

         5.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to Section 5.3 below, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller against any and all Losses arising directly out of (a) any
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or

breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement or any other
agreement, certificate, document or instrument executed in connection herewith,
including, without limitation, the Real Estate Agreements, (c) any of the
Assumed Liabilities and the operation of the Business after the date hereof, (d)
the WARN Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
with respect to employees of Seller hired by Buyer on the date hereof and
retained by Buyer, without any material reduction in salary, benefits, job
duties or job title, for at least six (6) months hereafter, for which no
indemnity shall be provided) (it being the intention of the parties that this
provision allocate any WARN Act liability as contemplated by 20 CFR 639.4(c)),
(e) any Collective Bargaining Agreement not assumed by Buyer in connection with,
or subsequent to, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (it
being acknowledged and agreed that only the Collective Bargaining Agreements
listed in Exhibit B hereto have been so assumed by Buyer), including, but not
limited to, the failure by Buyer to assume any such Collective Bargaining
Agreement and any claim or grievance arising under Article I, Section 5 or
Article XIX of the San Leandro CBA in connection with or subsequent to the
transactions contemplated hereby (but excluding any cause of action for breach
of a Collective Bargaining Agreement arising prior to the date hereof; it being
agreed by the parties that any termination of employment by Seller in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be deemed to be a
breach of or default by Seller under any Collective Bargaining Agreement), and
(f) Buyer's failure to hire or employ any one or more of Seller's Ontario,
Canada employees and any one or more of Seller's employees that are subject to
the Collective Bargaining Agreements, and/or Buyer's termination of any one or
more of Seller's employees hired or employed by Buyer or who are or were
employed in Ontario, Canada. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
5.2 to the contrary, Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify Seller for any
Losses arising from Buyer's failure to hire or employ one or more of Seller's
employees that are not subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreements;
provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not
apply to the Ontario, Canada employees of Seller.

         5.3      Limitations on Indemnity.

                  (a) Neither Seller nor Parent shall have any liability or
         obligation to Buyer whatsoever, and no claim shall be asserted against
         Seller or Parent, for indemnification under Section 5.1(a) unless and
         until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by Buyer as a result
         thereof exceeds $30,000 (the "Basket"), and then only to the extent the
         aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds the Basket and is less than
         $1,000,000 (the "Cap") after which Seller and Parent will have no
         obligation to indemnify Buyer from and against any further Losses;
         provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this Section
         5.3(a) above shall not apply to claims for indemnification brought for
         an inaccuracy of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
         4.1(b) (authorization), Section 4.1(c) (validity), Section 4.1(f)
         (title), Section 4.1(i) (taxes), Section 4.1(o) (ERISA) (but only to
         the extent such representation or warranty relates directly to a matter
         of taxation), or to claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

                  (b) Buyer shall have no liability or obligation to Seller
         whatsoever, and no claim shall be asserted against Buyer, for
         indemnification under Section 5.2(a) unless and until the aggregate
         amount of Losses incurred by Seller as a result thereof exceeds the
         Basket, and then only to the extent the aggregate amount of such Losses
         exceeds the Basket and is less than the Cap after which Buyer will have
         no obligation to indemnify Seller from and against any further Losses;
         provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this Section
         5.3(b) above shall not apply to claims for indemnification brought for
         an inaccuracy of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
         4.3(b) (authorization), or to claims for fraud or intentional
         misrepresentation.

                  (c) All representations and warranties made by Seller or Buyer
         in this Agreement, and any other agreement, certificate, document or
         instrument delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the consummation of
         the transactions contemplated hereby and be enforceable against Seller
         for the following period after the date hereof, after which time they
         shall expire and be of no further force or effect: (i) Section 4.1(b)
         (authorization), Section 4.1(c) (validity), and Section 4.1(f) (title),
         and Section 4.3(b) indefinitely; (ii) Section 4.1(h) (taxes) and
         Section 4.1(o) (ERISA), for the applicable statute of limitations,
         (iii) Section 4.1(k) (environmental), three (3) years; and (iv) all
         other representations and warranties, twenty (20) months. Any claim for
         indemnification with respect to any such matter which is not asserted
         by a notice given as herein provided, that specifically identifies the
         particular breach underlying such claim, within such period of survival
         may not be pursued and shall be thereafter forever barred.

                  (d) The sole recourse and exclusive remedy of Buyer for
         breaches or inaccuracies of representations and warranties and
         covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and any other
         agreement, certificate, document or instrument delivered pursuant
         hereto, including, without limitation, the Real Estate Agreements (and
         in connection with any Excluded Liabilities) shall be indemnification
         under Section 5.1 above and Buyer may not bring any other claim
         whatsoever in connection therewith.

                  (e) In no event shall Buyer be entitled to indemnification
         under Section 5.1 above for any inaccuracy of a representation or
         warranty if Buyer had (as of the date of this Agreement) any knowledge
         of any matter causing such representation or warranty to be inaccurate,
         to the extent such knowledge was obtained from any matter disclosed in
         writing to Buyer or any of its employees, agents, representatives or
         Affiliates, or is otherwise described in this Agreement, the Schedules
         hereto, or any other document, instrument or agreement executed in
         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (f) In no event (except for fraud or intentional
         misrepresentation) shall Buyer be entitled to indemnification under
         Section 5.1 in connection with any claim relating to the Accounts
         Receivable (it being the intention of the parties that all such matters
         shall be resolved through the process described in Section 3.1(b)
         above).

                  (g) In no event shall Buyer be entitled to indemnification
         under Section 5.1 in connection with any Losses, to the extent such
         Losses are taken into account in the calculation of Closing Date
         Working Capital.

                  (h) The parties hereto acknowledge the indemnification
         provisions of the Real Estate Agreements and consent to and agree as to
         their determination as provided therein, and as this Agreement is
         referred to therein.

                  (i) For purposes of clarity, the limitations set forth in
         Sections 5.3(a), (b) and (c) above only apply to claims for
         indemnification relating to inaccuracies or breaches of representations
         and warranties. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of
         the foregoing, such limitations shall not apply to indemnification
         claims relating to breaches of covenants, or Excluded Liabilities or
         Assumed Liabilities (as the case may be).

                  (j) In the event that any claim for indemnification by Buyer
         under this Agreement may be brought both as a claim for the inaccuracy
         or breach of a representation and warranty by Seller, or as an Excluded
         Liability, Buyer may bring such claim as an Excluded Liability and the
         limitations set forth in Sections 5.3(a) and (c) above shall not apply
         to such claim.

         5.4      Third-Party Claims.

                  (a) Promptly after receipt by a party hereto entitled to
         indemnity under Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 (an "Indemnified Person") of
         notice of the assertion of a claim for which such party hereto is
         entitled to indemnity hereunder against it by a third party (a
         "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the
         party hereto obligated to indemnify under such Section (an
         "Indemnifying Person") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim,
         provided, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not
         relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to
         any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
         Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is
         prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.

                  (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying
         Person pursuant to Section 5.4(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party
         Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the
         defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes, to
         assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory
         to the Indemnifying Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person
         to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such
         Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it
         diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person
         under this Article 5 for any fees or costs of other counsel or any
         other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
         in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in
         connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the
         Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i)
         such assumption will not establish for purposes of this Agreement that
         the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and
         subject to indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or settlement of
         such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Person
         without the Indemnified Person's consent unless (A) there is no finding
         or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
         any party; and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
         are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Person may,
         by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to
         defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the
         Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of any
         Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any
         compromise or settlement effected without its consent.


                                    ARTICLE 6
                              ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

         6.1 General. If any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will take such
further action (including, without limitation, the execution and delivery of
such further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may
request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the
requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article 5 above).

         6.2      Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation.

                  (a) Noncompetition. For a period of three (3) years after the
         date hereof, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, anywhere in the
         geographic regions in which Seller currently conducts the Business,
         directly or indirectly, invest in, own, manage, operate or provide
         financial assistance to, any Person engaged in any business that
         competes with the Business as currently conducted (a "Competing
         Business"); provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates, in the
         aggregate, may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than)
         five percent (5%) of any class of the securities of any entity if such
         securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange
         or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
         Act of 1934.

                  (b) Nonsolicitation. For a period of three (3) years after the
         date hereof, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, directly or
         indirectly, (i) solicit any Person who is as of the date hereof a
         customer or supplier of Seller to cease doing business with Buyer after
         the date hereof, (ii) solicit for employment (other than general
         advertising, not targeted directly to such Persons) any Transferred
         Employee, or (iii) induce any Transferred Employee to leave the employ
         of Buyer. Nothing set forth in this Section 6.2(b) shall prohibit
         Seller or its Affiliates from soliciting a customer, supplier or
         employee with respect to any business other than the Business.

         6.3      Employees and Employee Benefits.

                  (a) Employment of Employees by Buyer. Buyer shall have no
         obligation whatsoever to extend employment opportunities to any
         employees of Seller. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give
         any employees of Seller any rights of any kind against Buyer and none
         of such employees shall be third party beneficiaries.

                  (b) Salaries and Benefits.

                           (i) Seller shall be responsible for the payment of
                  all wages and other remuneration and/or compensation due to
                  its employees with respect to their services as employees of
                  Seller through the close of business on the date hereof,
                  including, without limitation, 401(k) and vacation pay
                  accruals and 2004 bonus obligations accrued prior to the date
                  hereof, to the extent such amounts are not included as part of
                  the Current Liabilities.

                           (ii) Seller shall also be liable for any claims made
                  or incurred by its employees and their beneficiaries through
                  the date hereof under all Benefit Plans which are not part of
                  the Assumed Liabilities. For purposes of the immediately
                  preceding sentence, a charge will be deemed incurred, in the
                  case of hospital, medical or dental benefits, when the
                  services that are the subject of the charge are performed and,
                  in the case of other benefits (such as disability or life
                  insurance), when an event has occurred or when a condition has
                  been diagnosed that entitles the employee to the benefit.

                           (iii) Buyer will adopt and assume at and as of the
                  date hereof each of the Defined Benefit Plans and each trust,
                  insurance contract, annuity contract or other funding
                  arrangement that Seller has established with respect thereto.
                  To the extent that Buyer hires any employees of Seller, Buyer
                  will ensure that the Defined Benefit Plans treat employment
                  with any of Seller and its Affiliates prior to the date hereof
                  the same as employment after the date hereof for purposes of
                  eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual. On the date hereof,
                  Seller will cause the Defined Benefit Plans to be amended to
                  substitute Buyer as the sponsor of those plans by naming Buyer
                  as the "Employer" thereunder, and Buyer will accept such
                  sponsorship and such amendment, in writing. On the date
                  hereof, Seller will cause the trusts established under the
                  Defined Benefit Plans to be amended to remove the existing
                  trustees and substitute new trustees who shall be officers of
                  Buyer or such other corporate trustee or other responsible and
                  solvent individuals as Buyer may select, and the new trustees
                  shall accept such substitution and amendment, in writing.

                           (iv) Buyer will adopt and assume at and as of the
                  date hereof any and all obligations of Seller with respect to
                  both the Canadian Retirement Plan and the Canadian Welfare
                  Plan, and agrees to execute and deliver any and all documents
                  required either by the Canadian Retirement Plan or the
                  Canadian Welfare Plan or under applicable law, and/or as
                  reasonably requested by Seller, in order to effectuate such
                  adoption and assumption.

                           (v) Seller shall comply with all applicable COBRA
                  notice and continuation coverage requirements (as well as with
                  comparable applicable requirements under the laws of the
                  province of Ontario).

                           (vi) In the event any Transferred Employee exercises
                  his or her rights under COBRA and elects to remain under
                  Seller's health insurance plan, and such Transferred Employee
                  fails to reimburse Seller for his or her premiums paid by
                  Seller for such health insurance when due, Buyer covenants to
                  cooperate and assist Seller in collecting the amount due
                  Seller from such Transferred Employee.

                  (c) 2004 Defined Benefit Plan Obligations. Seller and Buyer
         shall pay, perform, and discharge their respective liabilities and
         obligations relating to the 2004 Defined Benefit Plan Obligations as
         set forth in Schedule 1.1 hereto, and shall file all reports, returns
         and other matters required in connection therewith.

         6.4 Environmental Matters. Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense,
as soon as practical after the completion of the inventory conducted by the
Seller after the date hereof, remove any drums containing an unidentified waste
fluid (as determined from such inventory) from the real property where Seller
conducted the Business immediately prior to the date hereof.

         6.5 Automobile Leases. To the extent any of the lessors of the
automobile leases listed in Schedule 4.1(m) hereto fails to consent to the
assignment of such leases from Seller to Buyer prior to or on the date hereof,
or fails to terminate such leases and enter into new leases with Buyer for the
automobiles subject thereto, Seller shall hold such leases in trust for the
benefit of Buyer, and Buyer shall timely and fully perform and pay all costs and
liabilities thereunder from and after the date hereof. Buyer will use its best
efforts to enter into new leases with such lessors or to acquire the consent of
such lessors to such assignment, within 30 days of the date hereof. If Buyer is
unable to do so, on or before the expiration of such 30-day period, Buyer shall
pay to such lessors, in full, all amounts required to pay-off such leases and
acquire title to the automobiles the subject thereof. During such 30-day period,
Buyer shall be responsible for all losses, liabilities, costs and damages
associated with the automobiles (and the use and/or operation thereof) that are
the subject of such leases and Seller shall maintain (at Buyer's sole cost) all
policies of insurance with respect thereto as are required by such leases.


                                    ARTICLE 7
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         7.1 Assignment. No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto; provided, however, that any party hereto may collaterally

                  (a) Each party hereto will pay all costs, fees and expenses
         incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to

         its part to be performed, including the fees, expenses and
         disbursements of its respective counsel and accountants.

                  (b) In any litigation between the parties regarding this

         reasonable expenses and court costs, including, without limitation,
         reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by the prevailing party.
         A party shall be considered the prevailing party if (i) it initiated
         the litigation and obtains substantially all of the relief or remedy it
         sought, either through a judgment or the losing party's voluntary
         action, (ii) the other party withdraws its action without substantially
         obtaining the relief or remedy it sought, or (iii) it did not initiate
         the litigation and judgment is entered for either party, but without
         substantially granting the relief or remedy sought by the initiating
         party.

         7.4      Governing Law; Forum.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
         accordance with the Laws of the State of Indiana, without regard to
         such jurisdiction's conflict of laws principles.

                  (b) Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or
         relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforceability
         or validity of this Agreement, if brought by Buyer shall be brought
         only in the Marion County, State of Indiana, Circuit or Superior Courts
         or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, any United States District
         Court sitting in Marion County, Indiana, and each of the parties
         irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in
         any such matter, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
         venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of
         the matter shall be heard and determined only in any such court.

                  (c) Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or
         relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforceability

         or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, any United States District

         any such matter, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
         venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of
         the matter shall be heard and determined only in any such court.

                  (d) The parties agree that either of them may file a copy of
         this Section 7.4 with any court as written evidence of the knowing,
         voluntary and bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to
         waive any objections to venue or to convenience of forum. Process in
         any matter referred to in this Section 7.4 may be served on any party
         anywhere in the world.

         7.5      Partial Invalidity; Injunctive Rights.

                  (a) In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
         (including, without limitation, Section 6.2 above) shall, for any
         reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
         such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
         other provisions of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
         construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
         provisions had never been contained herein. If any applicable statute,
         rule or regulation contains any (nonwaivable) requirement that is
         contrary to or conflicts with any provision set forth in Section 6.2
         above, such requirement shall be substituted for such provision or part
         thereof to the minimum extent necessary to validate such provision or
         part thereof. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is
         finally determined by any court or agency to not be effective or
         enforceable as written, and if such determination is upheld on appeal
         or no appeal from such determination is taken, then the parties agree
         that such court or agency shall (or if such court or agency is
         unwilling or fails to do so then the parties shall) amend and modify
         such provision or part thereof to restrict the duration, area or scope
         to the minimum extent required to make such provision or part thereof
         enforceable and the parties hereby consent to the entry of an order so
         restricting such provision, or part thereof.

                  (b) In the event of an actual or overtly threatened breach of
         any provisions of this Section 6.2 above, Buyer, in addition to any
         other remedies available for such breach or threatened breach,
         including the recovery of damages, shall be entitled to seek an
         injunction (without the posting of bond) restraining the offender from
         such conduct.

         7.6 Execution in Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may
be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an
original counterpart, and all of which shall be considered to be but one
agreement and shall become a binding agreement when each party shall have
executed one counterpart and delivered it to the other party hereto. A signature
affixed to a counterpart of this Agreement and delivered by facsimile by any
Person is intended to be its, his or her signature and shall be valid, binding
and enforceable against the party on whose behalf it has been affixed.

         7.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (along
with each other agreement, certificate, document or instrument executed in
connection herewith) contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto
with regard to the subject matter contained in this Agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements or understandings of the parties. The parties, only by mutual
agreement in writing, may amend, modify and supplement this Agreement. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right
of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of
any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach.

         7.8 WARN Act; Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer acknowledges that Seller will
not comply with the provisions of the WARN Act or any bulk transfer laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In
connection with Section 5.2(d) above, Buyer expressly assumes any and all
responsibility, liability and obligation with respect to any notice required to
be given, and any required notice which is not given, and any severance or other
payment which may become due, pursuant to the WARN Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and any employment loss in connection
therewith, and acknowledges that Seller shall not provide or be required to
provide any notice pursuant to the WARN Act.

     7.9 Time of Essence.  Time is of the  essence  with regard to all dates and
time periods set forth or referred to in this --------------- Agreement.
