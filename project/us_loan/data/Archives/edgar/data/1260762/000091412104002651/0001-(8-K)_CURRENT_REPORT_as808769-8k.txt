ITEM 8.01.  Other Events
            ------------

            On August 20, 2003, Asset Backed Funding Corporation (the
"Corporation"), sold ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, Class
A-1, Class A-1A, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class
M-4, Class M-5 and Class M-6 (the "Offered Certificates"), having an aggregate
original principal balance of $761,567,000.00. The Offered Certificates were
issued pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2003
(the "Agreement"), among the Corporation, as depositor, Option One Mortgage
Corporation, as master servicer and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as
trustee, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto. ABFC Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, Class CE, Class P and Class R (the "Private
Certificates" and, together with the Offered Certificates, the "Certificates"),
were also issued pursuant to the Agreement but were not publicly offered.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 99.05% undivided interest in a trust (the "Trust"),
consisting primarily of conventional fixed-rate mortgage loans and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans, secured by mortgages creating first and second
liens on one- to four-family properties and certain other property. The
remaining undivided interests in the Trust are evidenced by the Private
Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement.

            An election will be made to treat certain assets of the Trust as one
or more real estate mortgage investment conduits for federal income tax purposes
(each, a "REMIC").
