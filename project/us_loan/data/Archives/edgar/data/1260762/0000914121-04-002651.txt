ITEM 8.01.  Other Events
            ------------

            On August 20, 2003, Asset Backed Funding Corporation (the
"Corporation"), sold ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, Class
A-1, Class A-1A, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class
M-4, Class M-5 and Class M-6 (the "Offered Certificates"), having an aggregate
original principal balance of $761,567,000.00. The Offered Certificates were
issued pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2003
(the "Agreement"), among the Corporation, as depositor, Option One Mortgage
Corporation, as master servicer and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as
trustee, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto. ABFC Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, Class CE, Class P and Class R (the "Private
Certificates" and, together with the Offered Certificates, the "Certificates"),
were also issued pursuant to the Agreement but were not publicly offered.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 99.05% undivided interest in a trust (the "Trust"),
consisting primarily of conventional fixed-rate mortgage loans and
adjustable-rate mortgage loans, secured by mortgages creating first and second
liens on one- to four-family properties and certain other property. The
remaining undivided interests in the Trust are evidenced by the Private
Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement.

            An election will be made to treat certain assets of the Trust as one
or more real estate mortgage investment conduits for federal income tax purposes
(each, a "REMIC").

            This Pooling and Servicing Agreement is dated as of July 1, 2003
(the "Agreement"), among ASSET BACKED FUNDING CORPORATION, as depositor (the
"Depositor"), OPTION ONE MORTGAGE CORPORATION, as servicer (the "Master
Servicer"), and WELLS FARGO BANK MINNESOTA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as trustee
(the "Trustee").

                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

            The Depositor intends to sell pass-through certificates
(collectively, the "Certificates"), to be issued hereunder in multiple Classes,
which in the aggregate will evidence the entire beneficial ownership interest in
the Trust Fund created hereunder. The Certificates will consist of thirteen
Classes of Certificates, designated as (i) the Class A-1, Class A-1A, Class A-2
and Class A-3 Certificates, (ii) the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4,
Class M-5 and Class M-6 Certificates, (iii) the Class CE Certificates, (iv) the
Class P Certificates and (v) the Class R Certificate.

            As provided herein, the Trustee shall elect that the Trust Fund be
treated for federal income tax purposes as four separate real estate mortgage
investment conduits (each a "REMIC" or, in the alternative, "REMIC 1," "REMIC
2," REMIC 3" and "REMIC 4," respectively). The Class T4-A1IO, Class T4-A1AIO,
Class T4-A2IO, Class T4-A3IO, Class T4-M1IO, Class T4-M2IO, Class T4-M3IO, Class
T4-M4IO, Class T4-M5IO, Class T4-M6IO, Class T4-4, Class T4-11, Class T4-12 and
Class T4-13 Interests (such interests, the "REMIC 4 Components"), the Class
T4-A1, Class T4-A1A, Class T4-A2, Class T4-A3, Class T4-M1, Class T4-M2, Class
T4-M3, Class T4-M4, Class T4-M5 and Class T4-M6 Interests represent all of the
"regular interests" in REMIC 4. Each Class of Offered Certificates represents
beneficial ownership of the corresponding REMIC 4 Regular Interest and the right

REMIC 3 Regular Interests and REMIC 4 Regular Interests are "REMIC Regular
Interests." The REMIC 1 Regular Interests will be held as assets of REMIC 2, the
REMIC 2 Regular Interests will be held as assets of REMIC 3 and the REMIC 3
Regular Interests will be held as assets of REMIC 4. The REMIC 4 Regular
Interests will be held as assets of the Grantor Trust, which will also hold (i)
the rights of the Offered Certificates to receive their respective Cap Carryover
Amounts and (ii) the Yield Maintenance Agreement, the Reserve Account and the
beneficial interest of the Class CE Certificates with respect thereto, subject
to the obligation to pay Cap Carryover Amounts. The Class P Certificates
represent an interest in the Grantor Trust created hereunder and are entitled to

            Section 2.01 Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

            The Depositor, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof,
does hereby transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Trustee, on
behalf of the Trust, without recourse for the benefit of the Certificateholders
all the right, title and interest of the Depositor, including any security
interest therein for the benefit of the Depositor, in and to (i) each Mortgage
Loan identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedules, including the related Cut-off

hereby deliver to, and deposit with the Trustee, or its designated agent, the
following documents or instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (a
"Mortgage File") so transferred and assigned:

            (i) the original Mortgage Note, endorsed either (A) in blank or (B)
      in the following form: "Pay to the order of Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
      National Association, as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing
      Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2003, among Asset Backed Funding
      Corporation, Option One Mortgage Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank
      Minnesota, National Association, ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates, Series
      2003-OPT1, without recourse," or with respect to any lost Mortgage Note,
      an original Lost Note Affidavit, together with a copy of the related
      Mortgage Note;

            (ii) the original Mortgage with evidence of recording thereon, and
      the original recorded power of attorney, if the Mortgage was executed
      pursuant to a power of attorney, with evidence of recording thereon or, if
      such Mortgage or power of attorney has been submitted for recording but
      has not been returned from the applicable public recording office, has
      been lost or is not otherwise available, a copy of such Mortgage or power
      of attorney, as the case may be, certified to be a true and complete copy
      of the original submitted for recording;

            (iii) an original Assignment of Mortgage, in form and substance
      acceptable for recording. The Mortgage shall be assigned either (A) in
      blank or (B) to "Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, as
      Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of July 1,
      2003, among Asset Backed Funding Corporation, Option One Mortgage
      Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, ABFC

            (iv) an original copy of any intervening assignment of Mortgage
      showing a complete chain of assignments;

            (v) the original or a certified copy of lender's title insurance
      policy; and

            (vi) the original or copies of each assumption, modification,
      written assurance or substitution agreement, if any.

            The Trustee agrees to execute and deliver to the Depositor on or
prior to the Closing Date an acknowledgment of receipt of the original Mortgage
Note (with any exceptions noted), substantially in the form attached as Exhibit
F-3 hereto.

            If any of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(ii), (iii) or
(iv) above has as of the Closing Date been submitted for recording but either
(x) has not been returned from the applicable public recording office or (y) has
been lost or such public recording office has retained the original of such
document, the obligations of the Depositor to deliver such documents shall be
deemed to be satisfied upon (1) delivery to the Trustee no later than the
Closing Date, of a copy of each such document certified by the Seller in the
case of (x) above or the applicable public recording office in the case of (y)
above to be a true and complete copy of the original that was submitted for
recording and (2) if such copy is certified by the Seller, delivery to the
Trustee, promptly upon receipt thereof of either the original or a copy of such
document certified by the applicable public recording office to be a true and
complete copy of the original. The Depositor shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Trustee promptly upon receipt thereof any other documents
constituting a part of a Mortgage File received with respect to any Mortgage
Loan, including, but not limited to, any original documents evidencing an
assumption or modification of any Mortgage Loan.

            Upon discovery or receipt of notice of any materially defective
document in, or that a document is missing from, a Mortgage File, the Seller
shall have 120 days to cure such defect or 150 days following the Closing Date,
in the case of missing Mortgages or Assignments or deliver such missing document
to the Trustee. If the Seller does not cure such defect or deliver such missing
document within such time period, the Seller shall either repurchase or
substitute for such Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.

            The Depositor shall cause the Assignments of Mortgage which were
delivered in blank to be completed. In the event that any Mortgage Note is
endorsed in blank as of the Closing Date, promptly following the Closing Date
the Depositor shall cause to be completed such endorsements "Pay to the order of
Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, as Trustee under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2003, among Asset Backed Funding
Corporation, Option One Mortgage Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
National Association, ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, without
recourse."

            The Depositor herewith delivers to the Trustee executed copies of
the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement.

            Section 2.02 Acceptance by Trustee.

            The Trustee acknowledges the receipt of, subject to the provisions
of Section 2.01 and subject to the review described below and any exceptions
noted on the exception report described in the next paragraph below, the
documents referred to in Section 2.01 above and all other assets included in the
definition of "Trust Fund" and declares that it holds and will hold such
documents and the other documents delivered to it constituting a Mortgage File,
and that it holds or will hold all such assets and such other assets included in
the definition of "Trust Fund" in trust for the exclusive use and benefit of all
present and future Certificateholders.

            The Trustee agrees, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, to
review each Mortgage File within 60 days after the Closing Date (or, with
respect to any document delivered after the Startup Day, within 60 days of
receipt and with respect to any Qualified Substitute Mortgage, within 60 days
after the assignment thereof) and to certify in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F-1 that, as to each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan
Schedules (other than any Mortgage Loan paid in full or any Mortgage Loan
specifically identified in the exception report annexed thereto as not being
covered by such certification), (i) all documents required to be delivered to it
pursuant to Section 2.01 of this Agreement are in its possession, (ii) such
documents have been reviewed by it and have not been mutilated, damaged or torn
and relate to such Mortgage Loan and (iii) based on its examination and only as
to the foregoing, the information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedules that
corresponds to items (1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (8), (10) and (22) of the Mortgage
Loan Schedules accurately reflects information set forth in the Mortgage File.
It is herein acknowledged that, in conducting such review, the Trustee is under
no duty or obligation to inspect, review or examine any such documents,
instruments, certificates or other papers to determine that they are genuine,
enforceable, or appropriate for the represented purpose or that they have
actually been recorded or that they are other than what they purport to be on
their face.

            Prior to the first anniversary date of this Agreement the Trustee
shall deliver to the Depositor and the Master Servicer a final certification in
the form annexed hereto as Exhibit F-2 evidencing the completeness of the
Mortgage Files, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon.

            If in the process of reviewing the Mortgage Files and making or
preparing, as the case may be, the certifications referred to above, the Trustee
finds any document or documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File to be
missing or defective in any material respect, at the conclusion of its review
the Trustee shall so notify the Seller, the Depositor and the Master Servicer.
In addition, upon the discovery by the Originator, the Seller, the Depositor,
the Trustee or the Master Servicer (or upon receipt by the Trustee of written
notification of such breach) of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Originator in the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement or the Seller in the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in respect of
any Mortgage Loan which materially adversely affects such Mortgage Loan or the
interests of the related Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties.

            The Depositor and the Trustee intend that the assignment and
transfer herein contemplated constitute a sale of the Mortgage Loans and the
Related Documents, conveying good title thereto free and clear of any liens and
encumbrances, from the Depositor to the Trustee and that such property not be
part of the Depositor's estate or property of the Depositor in the event of any
insolvency by the Depositor. In the event that such conveyance is deemed to be,
or to be made as security for, a loan, the parties intend that the Depositor
shall be deemed to have granted and does hereby grant to the Trustee, on behalf
of the Trust, a first priority perfected security interest in all of the
Depositor's right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans and the
Related Documents, and that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement
under applicable law.

            The Trustee is hereby directed to execute and deliver, on behalf of
the Trust, the Assignment, Assumption and Recognition Agreement, dated August
20, 2003, among the Depositor, the Seller, the Trustee and the Originator.

            Section 2.03 Repurchase or Substitution of Mortgage Loans by the
Originator or the Seller.

            (a) Upon discovery or receipt of written notice of any materially
defective document in, or that a document is missing from, a Mortgage File or of
the breach by the Originator or the Seller of any representation or warranty
under the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement in respect of any Mortgage Loan which materially adversely
affects the value of such Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Charge or the interest
therein of the Certificateholders, the Trustee shall promptly notify the
Originator or the Seller, as the case may be, and the Master Servicer of such
defect, missing document or breach and request that, in the case of a defective
or missing document, the Seller cure such defect or deliver such missing
document within 120 days from the date the Seller was notified of such missing
document or defect or, in the case of a beach of a representation or warranty,
request the Originator or the Seller, as applicable, cure such breach within 90
days from the date the Originator or the Seller, as the case may be, was
notified of such breach. If the Seller does not deliver such missing document or
cure such defect or if the Originator or the Seller, as applicable, does not
cure such breach in all material respects during such period, the Trustee shall
enforce the Originator's or the Seller's obligation, as the case may be, under
the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement, as applicable, and cause the Originator or the Seller, as applicable,
to repurchase such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price on or
prior to the Determination Date following the expiration of such period (subject
to Section 2.03(d)). The Purchase Price for the repurchased Mortgage Loan shall
be deposited in the Collection Account, and the Trustee, upon receipt of written
notice from the Master Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the Originator
or the Seller, as applicable, the related Mortgage File and shall execute and
deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without
recourse, as the Originator or the Seller, as applicable, shall furnish to it
and as shall be necessary to vest in the Originator or the Seller, as the case
may be, any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto and the Trustee shall have no
further responsibility with regard to such Mortgage File. In lieu of
repurchasing any such Mortgage Loan as provided above, the Originator or the
Seller, as the case may be, may cause such Mortgage Loan to be removed from the
Trust Fund (in which case it shall become a Defective Mortgage Loan) and
substitute one or more Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans in the manner and
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.03(c). In addition to the
foregoing, if the Purchase Price for a repurchased Mortgage Loan does not fully
compensate the Trust for any costs or damages incurred by the Trust in
connection with a breach of the Originator's representation set forth in Section
3.03(i) of the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement with respect to such
repurchased Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall reimburse the Trust the amount
necessary to fully compensate the Trust (the "Reimbursement Amount"). The
Reimbursement Amount shall be delivered to the Master Servicer for deposit into
the Collection Account within 10 days from the date the Seller was notified by
the Trustee of the Reimbursement Amount.

            With respect to the representations and warranties set forth in the
Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement that are made to the best of the Originator's or the Seller's
knowledge, as applicable, or as to which the Originator or the Seller, as the
case may be, has no knowledge, if it is discovered by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee that the substance of such representation and warranty
is inaccurate and such inaccuracy materially and adversely affects the value of
the related Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Charge or the interest therein of the
Certificateholders then, notwithstanding the Originator's or the Seller's lack
of knowledge with respect to the substance of such representation and warranty
being inaccurate at the time the representation or warranty was made, such
inaccuracy shall be deemed a breach of the applicable representation or
warranty.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and the Mortgage
Loan Purchase Agreement shall survive delivery of the Mortgage Files to the
Trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the Certificateholders notwithstanding
any restrictive or qualified endorsement or assignment. It is understood and
agreed that the obligations of the Originator and the Seller set forth in this
Section 2.03(a) to cure, substitute for or repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant
to the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and to pay the Reimbursement Amount
constitute the sole remedies available to the Certificateholders and to the
Trustee on their behalf respecting a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.

            The representations and warranties of the Originator with respect to
the Mortgage Loans in the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, which
have been assigned to the Trustee hereunder, were made as of the dates specified
in the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement. To the extent that any fact,
condition or event with respect to a Mortgage Loan constitutes a breach of both
(i) a representation or warranty of the Originator under the Originator Mortgage
Loan Purchase Agreement and (ii) a representation or warranty of the Seller
under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (other than Seller's representations
with respect to predatory and abusive lending laws and "high cost" loans in
Sections 3.01(k) and (l) of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement), the only
right or remedy of the Trustee or of any Certificateholder shall be the
Trustee's right to enforce the obligations of the Originator under any
applicable representation or warranty made by it. The Trustee acknowledges that
the Seller shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any breach of a
representation or warranty made by it with respect to the Mortgage Loans (except
as otherwise set forth in this paragraph) if the fact, condition or event
constituting such breach also constitutes a breach of a representation or
warranty made by the Originator in the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement, without regard to whether the Originator fulfills its contractual
obligations in respect of such representation or warranty. In addition, to the
extent that any fact, condition or event with respect to a Mortgage Loan
constitutes a breach of both (x) the Originator's representation with respect to
predatory and abusive lending laws in Section 3.03(i) of the Originator Mortgage
Loan Purchase Agreement and (y) the Seller's representation with respect to
predatory and abusive lending laws in Section 3.01(k) of the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement, the Trustee shall be entitled to enforce the Seller's
obligation to pay any Reimbursement Amount to the extent the Originator fails to
do so.

            (b) Within 90 days of the earlier of discovery by the Master
Servicer or receipt of notice by the Master Servicer of the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Master Servicer set forth in Section
2.05 which materially and adversely affects the interests of the
Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall cure such
breach in all material respects.

            (c) Any substitution of Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans for
Defective Mortgage Loans made pursuant to Section 2.03(a) must be effected prior
to the last Business Day that is within two years after the Closing Date. As to
any Defective Mortgage Loan for which the Originator or the Seller substitutes
an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, such substitution shall be
effected by the Originator or the Seller, as applicable, delivering to the
Trustee for such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Mortgage Note,
the Mortgage, the Assignment to the Trustee, and such other documents and
agreements, with all necessary endorsements thereon, as are required by Section
2.01, together with an Officers' Certificate providing that each such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan satisfies the definition thereof and specifying the
Substitution Adjustment Amount (as described below), if any, in connection with
such substitution. The Trustee shall acknowledge receipt for such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and, within ten Business Days thereafter,
shall review such documents as specified in Section 2.02 and deliver to the
Master Servicer, with respect to such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or
Loans, a certification substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1,
with any applicable exceptions noted thereon. Within one year of the date of
substitution, the Trustee shall deliver to the Master Servicer a certification
substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 hereto with respect to such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon.
Monthly Payments due with respect to Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans in the
month of substitution are not part of the Trust Fund and will be retained by the
Originator or the Seller, as applicable. For the month of substitution,
distributions to Certificateholders will reflect the collections and recoveries
in respect of such Defective Mortgage Loan in the Collection Period or
Prepayment Period, as applicable, preceding the date of substitution and the
Depositor, the Originator or the Seller, as the case may be, shall thereafter be
entitled to retain all amounts subsequently received in respect of such
Defective Mortgage Loan. The Depositor shall give or cause to be given written
notice to the Certificateholders that such substitution has taken place, shall
amend the applicable Mortgage Loan Schedule (and Prepayment Charge Schedule, if
applicable) to reflect the removal of such Defective Mortgage Loan from the
terms of this Agreement and the substitution of the Eligible Substitute Mortgage
Loan or Loans and shall deliver a copy of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to
the Trustee. Upon such substitution, such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or
Loans shall constitute part of the Mortgage Pool and shall be subject in all
respects to the terms of this Agreement and, in the case of a substitution
effected by the Originator or the Seller, the Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, as the case may be,
including, in the case of a substitution effected by the Originator or the
Seller, all applicable representations and warranties thereof included in the
Originator Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement, as the case may be, as of the date of substitution.

            For any month in which the Originator or the Seller substitutes one
or more Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Defective Mortgage
Loans, the Master Servicer will determine the amount (the "Substitution
Adjustment Amount"), if any, by which the aggregate Purchase Price of all such
Defective Mortgage Loans exceeds the aggregate, as to each such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan, of the principal balance thereof as of the date of
substitution, together with one month's interest on such principal balance at
the applicable Net Mortgage Interest Rate. On the date of such substitution, the
Originator or the Seller, as the case may be, will deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Master Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account an amount
equal to the Substitution Adjustment Amount, if any, and the Trustee, upon
receipt of the related Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and notice by
the Master Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the Originator or the
Seller, as applicable, the related Mortgage File or Files and shall execute and
deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without
recourse, as the Originator or the Seller, as the case may be, shall deliver to
it and as shall be necessary to vest therein any Defective Mortgage Loan
released pursuant hereto.

            In addition, the Originator or the Seller, as applicable, shall
obtain at its own expense and deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that such substitution will not cause (a) any federal tax to be
imposed on the Trust Fund, including without limitation, any federal tax imposed
on "prohibited transactions" under Section 860F(a)(l) of the Code or on
"contributions after the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(l) of the Code, or
(b) any REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is
outstanding. If such Opinion of Counsel can not be delivered, then such
substitution may only be effected at such time as the required Opinion of
Counsel can be given.

            (d) Upon discovery by the Originator, the Seller, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee that any Mortgage Loan does not constitute a "qualified
mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, the party
discovering such fact shall within two Business Days give written notice thereof
to the other parties. In connection therewith, the Originator or the Seller, as
applicable, shall repurchase or, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2.03(c), substitute one or more Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans for the
affected Mortgage Loan within 90 days of the earlier of discovery or receipt of
such notice with respect to such affected Mortgage Loan. In addition, upon
discovery that a Mortgage Loan is defective in a manner that would cause it to
be a "defective obligation" within the meaning of Treasury regulations relating
to REMICs, the Originator or the Seller, as the case may be, shall cure the
defect or make the required purchase or substitution no later than 90 days after
the discovery of the defect. Any such repurchase or substitution shall be made
in the same manner as set forth in Section 2.03(a). The Trustee shall reconvey
to the Originator or the Seller, as applicable, the Mortgage Loan to be released
pursuant hereto in the same manner, and on the same terms and conditions, as it
would a Mortgage Loan repurchased for breach of a representation or warranty.

            Section 2.04 [Reserved].

            Section 2.05 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Master
Servicer.

            The Master Servicer hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the
Trustee, for the benefit of each of the Trustee and the Certificateholders and
to the Depositor that as of the Closing Date or as of such date specifically
provided herein:

            (i) The Master Servicer is a corporation duly organized, validly
      existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California
      and has all licenses necessary to carry on its business as now being
      conducted, except for such licenses, certificates and permits the absence
      of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material
      adverse effect on the ability of the Master Servicer to conduct its
      business as it is presently conducted, and is licensed, qualified and in
      good standing in the states where the Mortgaged Property is located if the
      laws of such state require licensing or qualification in order to conduct
      business of the type conducted by the Master Servicer or to ensure the
      enforceability or validity of each Mortgage Loan; the Master Servicer has
      the power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
      perform in accordance herewith; the execution, delivery and performance of
      this Agreement (including all instruments of transfer to be delivered
      pursuant to this Agreement) by the Master Servicer and the consummation of
      the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
      authorized; and all requisite corporate action has been taken by the
      Master Servicer to make this Agreement valid and binding upon the Master
      Servicer in accordance with its terms;

            (ii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement are in the ordinary course of business of the Master Servicer
      and will not result in the breach of any term or provision of the articles
      of incorporation or by-laws of the Master Servicer or result in the breach
      of any term or provision of, or conflict with or constitute a default
      under or result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any
      agreement, indenture or loan or credit agreement or other instrument to
      which the Master Servicer or its property is subject, or result in the
      violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to which
      the Master Servicer or its property is subject;

            (iii) The Master Servicer is an approved seller/servicer of
      conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,
      with the facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for
      the sound servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage
      Loans. The Master Servicer is a HUD approved mortgagee pursuant to Section
      203 of the National Housing Act and is in good standing to sell mortgage
      loans to and service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and no
      event has occurred, including but not limited to a change in insurance
      coverage, which would make the Master Servicer unable to comply with
      Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac eligibility requirements or which would require
      notification to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;

            (iv) This Agreement, and all documents and instruments contemplated
      hereby which are executed and delivered by the Master Servicer, constitute
      and will constitute valid, legal and binding obligations of the Master
      Servicer, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
      the enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
      enforcement of creditors' rights generally (whether considered in a
      proceeding at law or in equity);

            (v) The Master Servicer does not believe, nor does it have any
      reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant
      contained in this Agreement;

            (vi) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending
      or, to its knowledge, threatened against the Master Servicer that, either
      individually or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse
      change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or
      assets of the Master Servicer, or in any material impairment of the right
      or ability of the Master Servicer to carry on its business substantially
      as now conducted, or in any material liability on the part of the Master
      Servicer, or that would draw into question the validity or enforceability
      of this Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in connection with
      the obligations of the Master Servicer contemplated herein, or that would
      be likely to impair materially the ability of the Master Servicer to
      perform under the terms of this Agreement;

            (vii) No consent, approval or order of any court or governmental
      agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by
      the Master Servicer of or compliance by the Master Servicer with this
      Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations and orders,
      if any, that have been obtained; and

            (viii) No information in this Agreement provided by the Master
      Servicer nor any information, certificate of an officer, statement
      furnished in writing or report delivered to the Trustee by the Master
      Servicer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby contains
      or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will
      omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
      contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
      made, not misleading.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Section 2.05 shall survive delivery of the Mortgage
Files to the Trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee, the
Depositor and the Certificateholders. Upon discovery by any of the Depositor,
the Master Servicer or the Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing
representations, warranties and covenants which materially and adversely affects
the value of any Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Charge or the interests therein of
the Certificateholders, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt
written notice (but in no event later than two Business Days following such
discovery) to the other parties hereto.

            Section 2.06 Representations and Warranties of the Depositor.

            The Depositor represents and warrants to the Trust and the Trustee
on behalf of the Certificateholders and to the Master Servicer as follows:

            (i) This agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
      of the Depositor, enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its
      terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or
      hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in
      general and except as such enforceability may be limited by general
      principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
      equity);

            (ii) Immediately prior to the sale and assignment by the Depositor
      to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust of each Mortgage Loan, the Depositor
      had good and marketable title to each Mortgage Loan (insofar as such title
      was conveyed to it by the Seller) subject to no prior lien, claim,
      participation interest, mortgage, security interest, pledge, charge or
      other encumbrance or other interest of any nature;

            (iii) As of the Closing Date, the Depositor has transferred all
      right, title interest in the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee on behalf of
      the Trust;

            (iv) The Depositor has not transferred the Mortgage Loans to the
      Trustee on behalf of the Trust with any intent to hinder, delay or defraud
      any of its creditors;

            (v) The Depositor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing
      as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
      with full corporate power and authority to own its assets and conduct its
      business as presently being conducted;

            (vi) The Depositor is not in violation of its certificate of
      incorporation or by-laws or in default in the performance or observance of
      any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any
      contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other
      instrument to which the Depositor is a party or by which it or its
      properties may be bound, which default might result in any material
      adverse changes in the financial condition, earnings, affairs or business
      of the Depositor or which might materially and adversely affect the
      properties or assets, taken as a whole, of the Depositor;

            (vii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
      the Depositor, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
      thereby, do not and will not result in a material breach or violation of
      any of the terms or provisions of, or, to the knowledge of the Depositor,
      constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
      agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Depositor is a
      party or by which the Depositor is bound or to which any of the property
      or assets of the Depositor is subject, nor will such actions result in any
      violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
      of the Depositor or, to the best of the Depositor's knowledge without
      independent investigation, any statute or any order, rule or regulation of
      any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the
      Depositor or any of its properties or assets (except for such conflicts,
      breaches, violations and defaults as would not have a material adverse
      effect on the ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under
      this Agreement);

            (viii) To the best of the Depositor's knowledge without any
      independent investigation, no consent, approval, authorization, order,
      registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency
      or body of the United States or any other jurisdiction is required for the
      issuance of the Certificates, or the consummation by the Depositor of the
      other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such consents,
      approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as (a) may be
      required under State securities or Blue Sky laws, (b) have been previously
      obtained or (c) the failure of which to obtain would not have a material
      adverse effect on the performance by the Depositor of its obligations
      under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement; and

            (ix) There are no actions, proceedings or investigations pending
      before or, to the Depositor's knowledge, threatened by any court,
      administrative agency or other tribunal to which the Depositor is a party

      adversely to the Depositor would have a material adverse effect on the
      business, results of operations or financial condition of the Depositor;
      (b) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or the Certificates; (c)
      seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the consummation by
      the Depositor of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
      as the case may be; (d) which might materially and adversely affect the
      performance by the Depositor of its obligations under, or the validity or
      enforceability of, this Agreement.

            Section 2.07 Issuance of Certificates and the Uncertificated Regular

                                   ARTICLE III

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                                OF THE TRUST FUND

            Section 3.01 Master Servicer to Act as Servicer.

            The Master Servicer, as independent contract servicer, shall service
and administer the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement and the
normal and usual standards of practice of prudent mortgage servicers servicing
similar mortgage loans and, to the extent consistent with such terms, in the
same manner in which it services and administers similar mortgage loans for its
own portfolio, and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do or
cause to be done any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which the Master Servicer may deem necessary or desirable and
consistent with the terms of this Agreement (the "Servicing Standard").

            Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Master Servicer may
waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the
postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant
indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Master Servicer's reasonable and prudent
determination such waiver, modification, postponement or indulgence is not
materially adverse to the Certificateholders; provided, however, that the Master
Servicer shall not make future advances and, except as set forth in the
following sentence or Section 3.03, the Master Servicer shall not permit any
modification with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would (i) change the
Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment thereof of any principal or
interest payments, reduce the outstanding principal amount (except for actual
payments of principal) or extend the final maturity date with respect to such
Mortgage Loan, (ii) affect adversely the status of any REMIC constituting part
of the Trust Fund as a REMIC, (iii) cause any such REMIC to be subject to a tax
on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant to the REMIC Provisions
or (iv) cause any MI Mortgage Loan to not be covered by the Mortgage Insurance
Policy unless the Combined Loan-to-Value Ratio is less than 60%. In the event
that the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage Loan or such
default is, in the judgment of the Master Servicer, reasonably foreseeable, the
Master Servicer may permit a modification of such Mortgage Loan to reduce the
Principal Balance thereof and/or extend the term, but not beyond the latest
maturity date of any other Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Master Servicer shall not permit any modification with respect to any Mortgage
Loan that would both (x) effect an exchange or reissuance of such Mortgage Loan
under Section 1.860G-2(b) of the Treasury Regulations and (y) cause any REMIC
constituting part of the Trust Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code
or the imposition of any tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions"
after the Startup Day under the REMIC Provisions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall continue, and is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of itself, and the
Trustee, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full
release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Property. The Master Servicer
shall make all required Servicing Advances and shall service and administer the
Mortgage Loans in accordance with Applicable Regulations, and shall provide to
the Mortgagor any reports required to be provided to them thereby. The Trustee
shall execute and deliver to the Master Servicer within at least fifteen (15)
Business Day of receipt, upon request, any powers of attorney furnished to it by
the Master Servicer empowering the Master Servicer to execute and deliver
instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or
discharge, and to foreclose upon or otherwise liquidate any Mortgaged Property,
and to appeal, prosecute or defend in any court action relating to the Mortgage
Loans or the Mortgaged Properties, in accordance with this Agreement, and the
Trustee shall execute and deliver such other documents as the Master Servicer
may request, necessary or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to service
and administer the Mortgage Loans and carry out its duties hereunder, in each
case in accordance with Servicing Standard (and the Trustee shall have no
liability for misuse of any such powers of attorney by the Master Servicer).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Master Servicer
shall not without the Trustee's written consent: (i) initiate any action, suit
or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without indicating the Master
Servicer's representative capacity, or (ii) take any action with the intent to
cause, and which results in, the Trustee being registered to do business in any
state.

            In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Master
Servicer shall employ procedures including collection procedures and exercise
the same care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and
administering mortgage loans for its own account giving due consideration to
accepted mortgage servicing practices of prudent lending institutions and the
Certificateholders' reliance on the Master Servicer.

            The Master Servicer shall give prompt notice to the Trustee of any
action, of which the Master Servicer has actual knowledge, to (i) assert a claim
against the Trust Fund or (ii) assert jurisdiction over the Trust Fund.

            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of a voluntary Principal Prepayment in full of a Mortgage Loan, the Master
Servicer may not waive any Prepayment Charge or portion thereof required by the
terms of the related Mortgage Note unless (i)(a) the Master Servicer determines
that such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar mortgage loans,
(b) such waiver relates to a default or a reasonably foreseeable default and (c)
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Master Servicer, maximize recovery of
Liquidation Proceeds for such Mortgage Loan, taking into account the value of
such Prepayment Charge, or (ii) the enforceability thereof is limited (1) by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, or other similar law relating
to creditors' rights generally or (2) due to acceleration in connection with a
foreclosure or other involuntary payment. If the Master Servicer has waived or
does not collect all or a portion of a Prepayment Charge relating to a voluntary
Principal Prepayment in full due to any action or omission of the Master
Servicer, other than as provided above, the Master Servicer shall, on the date
on which the Principal Prepayment in full is remitted to the Trustee, deliver to
the Trustee the Servicer Prepayment Charge Amount with respect to such Mortgage
Loan for distribution in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            In the event that a Prepayment Charge due with respect to any
Mortgage Loan is not timely received by the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to determine whether the Originator is
obligated to pay a related Originator Prepayment Charge Payment Amount, and if
the Master Servicer determines that a Originator Prepayment Charge Payment
Amount is due, the Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Originator, and the
Master Servicer shall enforce the Originator's obligations to pay in a timely
manner any such Originator Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts and, to the extent
that such amounts are received by the Master Servicer, shall cause such amounts
to be deposited into the Collection Account within one Business Day of receipt.

            In addition, the Master Servicer shall administer the Mortgage
Insurance Policy on behalf of itself, the Depositor, and the Trustee for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, when it is necessary to make claims and
receive payments under the Mortgage Insurance Policy. Any amounts collected by
the Master Servicer under the Mortgage Insurance Policy shall be deposited in
the Certificate Account not later than two Business Days following receipt
thereof. The Master Servicer shall take whatever action is appropriate to
maximize the amounts payable under the Mortgage Insurance Policy and to service
the MI Mortgage Loans in the manner required by the Mortgage Insurance Policy.
The Master Servicer shall prepare and submit all claims eligible for submission
under the Mortgage Insurance Policy and shall perform all of the obligations of
the insured under the Mortgage Insurance Policy. If the Mortgage Insurance
Policy is terminated for any reason other than the exhaustion of its coverage,
or if the financial strength rating of the Insurer is reduced to below
investment grade, the Master Servicer will use its best efforts to obtain a
comparable policy from an insurer that is acceptable to the Rating Agencies. The
replacement policy will provide coverage equal to the then remaining coverage of
the Mortgage Insurance Policy, if available. However, if the premium cost of a
replacement policy exceeds the premium cost of the Mortgage Insurance Policy,
the coverage amount of the replacement policy will be reduced so that its
premium cost will not exceed the premium cost of the Mortgage Insurance Policy.

            Section 3.02 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

            Continuously from the date hereof until the principal and interest
on all Mortgage Loans are paid in full or as long as the Mortgage Loan remains
subject to this Agreement, the Master Servicer will diligently collect all
payments due under each Mortgage Loan when the same shall become due and payable
and shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement
and Applicable Regulations, follow such collection procedures as it follows with
respect to mortgage loans comparable to the Mortgage Loans and held for its own
account. Further, the Master Servicer will take special care in ascertaining and
estimating on escrowed Mortgage Loans annual ground rents, taxes, assessments,
water rates, fire and hazard insurance premiums, mortgage insurance premiums,
and all other charges that, as provided in the Mortgage, will become due and
payable to that end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be
sufficient to pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

            Section 3.03 Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

            In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not
paid when the same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails
to perform any other covenant or obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such
failure continues beyond any applicable grace period, the Master Servicer shall
take such action as it shall deem to be in the best interest of the
Certificateholders. With respect to any defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Master
Servicer shall have the right to review the status of the related forbearance
plan and, subject to the second paragraph of Section 3.01, may modify such
forbearance plan; including extending the Mortgage Loan repayment date for a
period of one year or reducing the Mortgage Interest Rate up to 50 basis points.

            In connection with a foreclosure or other conversion, the Master
Servicer shall exercise such rights and powers vested in it hereunder and use
the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as prudent mortgage servicers
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of their own
affairs and consistent with Applicable Regulations and the Servicing Standards,
including, without limitation, advancing funds for the payment of taxes and
insurance premiums.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.03, with
respect to any Mortgage Loan as to which the Master Servicer has received actual
notice of, or has actual knowledge of, the presence of any toxic or hazardous
substance on the related Mortgaged Property, the Master Servicer shall not
either (i) obtain title to such Mortgaged Property as a result of or in lieu of
foreclosure or otherwise, or (ii) otherwise acquire possession of, or take any
other action with respect to, such Mortgaged Property if, as a result of any
such action, the Trust would be considered to hold title to, to be a
mortgagee-in-possession of, or to be an owner or operator of such Mortgaged
Property within the meaning of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended from time to time, or any
comparable law, unless the Master Servicer has also previously determined, based
on its reasonable judgment and a prudent report prepared by a Person who
regularly conducts environmental audits using customary industry standards,
that:

            A. such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable
environmental laws or, if not, that it would be in the best economic interest of
the Certificateholders to take such actions as are necessary to bring the
Mortgaged Property into compliance therewith; and

            B. there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged Property
relating to the use, management or disposal of any hazardous substances,
hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based materials for which
investigation, testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could
be required under any federal, state or local law or regulation, or that if any
such materials are present for which such action could be required, that it
would be in the best economic interest of the Certificateholders to take such
actions with respect to the affected Mortgaged Property.

            The cost of the environmental audit report contemplated by this
Section 3.03 shall be advanced by the Master Servicer, subject to the Master
Servicer's right to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as
provided in Section 3.05(iv).

            If the Master Servicer determines, as described above, that it is in
the best economic interest of the Certificateholders to take such actions as are
necessary to bring any such Mortgaged Property into compliance with applicable
environmental laws, or to take such action with respect to the containment,
clean-up or remediation of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous
wastes, or petroleum-based materials affecting any such Mortgaged Property, then
the Master Servicer shall take such action as it deems to be in the best
economic interest of the Certificateholders. The cost of any such compliance,
containment, clean-up or remediation shall be advanced by the Master Servicer,
subject to the Master Servicer's right to be reimbursed therefor from the
Collection Account as provided in Section 3.05(ii).

            Section 3.04 Collection Account, Distribution Account and Reserve
Account.

            (a) The Master Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected
and received pursuant to each Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its
own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more
Collection Accounts. Each Collection Account shall be an Eligible Account.

            The Master Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account on a
daily basis within one Business Day of receipt, and retain therein, the
following payments and collections received or made by it after the Cut-off Date
with respect to the Mortgage Loans:

            (i) all payments on account of principal, including Principal
      Prepayments, on the Mortgage Loans;

            (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
      adjusted to the Mortgage Interest Rate less the Servicing Fee Rate;

            (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;

            (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be
      deposited pursuant to Section 3.10, other than proceeds to be held in the
      Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
      Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Master
      Servicer's normal servicing procedures, the loan documents or applicable
      law;

            (v) all Condemnation Proceeds affecting any Mortgaged Property which
      are not released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Master Servicer's
      normal servicing procedures, the loan documents or applicable law;

            (vi) any amounts required to be deposited by the Master Servicer in
      connection with any REO Property pursuant to Section 3.13; and

            (vii) all Prepayment Charges collected by the Master Servicer in
      connection with the voluntary Principal Prepayment in full of any Mortgage
      Loan, all Originator Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts paid by the
      Originator and all Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts required to
      be paid by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.29(b) in connection
      with any such Principal Prepayment.

            Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Collection Account,
subject to Section 3.25, shall accrue to the benefit of the Master Servicer and
the Master Servicer shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from
the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.05(v). The foregoing requirements
for deposit from the Collection Account shall be exclusive, it being understood
and agreed that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in
the nature of late payment charges, bad check fees, prepayment charges that are
not Prepayment Charges or Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts, assumption
fees and other similar fees need not be deposited by the Master Servicer in the
Collection Account. Amounts deposited in the Collection Account in error may be
withdrawn by the Master Servicer at any time.

            (b) On behalf of the Trust Fund, the Trustee shall establish and
maintain one or more accounts (such account or accounts, the "Distribution
Account"), held in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders. On behalf of
the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee in immediately
available funds for deposit in the Distribution Account by 1:00 p.m. New York
time on the Servicer Remittance Date, (i) that portion of the Available Funds
(calculated without regard to the references in the definition thereof to
amounts that may be deposited to the Distribution Account from a different
source as provided herein) then on deposit in the Collection Account, (ii) the
amount of all Prepayment Charges collected by the Master Servicer in connection
with the voluntary Principal Prepayment in full of any of the Mortgage Loans
then on deposit in the Collection Account (other than any such Prepayment
Charges received after the related Prepayment Period) and (iii) any Originator
Prepayment Charge Payment Amount or any Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment
Amount. Amounts in the Distribution Account shall be deemed to be held on behalf
of the related REMICs and the Grantor Trust in accordance with the REMIC
distributions set forth in Section 4.08. The Trustee shall be entitled to
withdraw from the Distribution Account any amounts owing to it pursuant to
Section 8.05 and Section 9.01(c) prior to the distribution of any amounts on
deposit to the Certificateholders; provided, however, in the case of amounts
owing to it other than the Trustee Fee, the Trustee shall provide the Depositor
and the Master Servicer with a written account of such amounts five Business
Days prior to withdrawing such funds. In connection with any failure by the
Master Servicer to make any remittance required to be made by the Master
Servicer to the Distribution Account on the day and by the time such remittance
is required to be made under the terms of this Section 3.04(b) (without giving
effect to any grace or cure period), the Master Servicer shall pay to the
Trustee for the account of the Trustee interest at the prime rate of United
States money center commercial banks as published in The Wall Street Journal on
any amount not timely remitted from and including the day such remittance was
required to be made to, but not including, the day on which such remittance was
actually made.

            (c) Funds in the Collection Account and the Distribution Account may
be invested in Eligible Investments in accordance with the provisions set forth
in Section 3.25. The Master Servicer shall give notice to the Trustee of the
location of the Collection Account maintained by it when established and prior
to any change thereof. The Trustee shall give notice to the Master Servicer and
the Depositor of the location of the Distribution Account when established and
prior to any change thereof.

            (d) In the event the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee
for deposit in the Distribution Account any amount not required to be deposited
therein, it may at any time request that the Trustee withdraw such amount from
the Distribution Account and remit to the Master Servicer any such amount, any
provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In addition, the Master
Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee from time to time for deposit, and the
Trustee shall so deposit, in the Distribution Account in respect of REMIC 1:

            (i) any Advances, as required pursuant to Section 4.07;

            (ii) any Stayed Funds, as soon as permitted by the federal
      bankruptcy court having jurisdiction in such matters;

            (iii) any amounts required to be deposited in the Distribution
      Account by the Master Servicer pursuant to Sections 2.03, 3.04, 3.13,
      3.15, 3.16, 3.23, 3.24, 4.07 or 10.01; and

            (iv) any amounts required to be deposited by the Master Servicer
      pursuant to Section 3.11 in connection with the deductible clause in any
      blanket hazard insurance policy, such deposit being made from the Master
      Servicer's own funds, without reimbursement therefor.

            (e) Promptly upon receipt of any Stayed Funds, whether from the
Master Servicer, a trustee in bankruptcy, or federal bankruptcy court or other
source, the Trustee shall notify the Master Servicer of such receipt and deposit
such funds in the Distribution Account, subject to withdrawal thereof as
permitted hereunder. In addition, the Trustee shall deposit in the Distribution
Account any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section 3.25(b) in
connection with losses realized on Eligible Investments with respect to funds
held in the Distribution Account.

            (f) Any Prepayment Charges, Originator Prepayment Charge Payment
Amounts and Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts deposited pursuant to
Section 3.04(a)(vii) shall not be assets of any REMIC created hereunder, but
shall be considered assets of the Grantor Trust held by the Trustee for the
benefit of the Class P Certificateholders.

            (g) (i) The Trustee shall establish and maintain the Reserve
Account, held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Offered
Certificates. The Trustee shall deposit in the Reserve Account on the date
received by it, any Yield Maintenance Agreement Payment received from the Yield
Maintenance Agreement Provider for the related Distribution Date. On each
Distribution Date, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Reserve Account any Yield
Maintenance Agreement Payment and apply it in the following order of priority:

                  (A) to the Offered Certificates, any remaining unpaid Cap
            Carryover Amounts for such Classes for such Distribution Date (after
            distributions pursuant to Section 4.02(b)(xxii) hereof), in each
            case only up to the Cap Amount for the related Class, distributed in
            the following order of priority:

                        (1) concurrently, to the Class A Certificates, pro rata,
                  based on the Cap Amount for each such Class; and

                        (2) sequentially, to the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class
                  M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5 and Class M-6 Certificates, in that
                  order; and

                  (B) to the Offered Certificates, any remaining unpaid Cap
            Carryover Amounts for such Classes for such Distribution Date (after
            distributions pursuant to Section 4.02(b)(xxii) hereof and clause
            (A) above) distributed in the following order of priority:

                        (1) concurrently, to the Class A Certificates, pro rata,
                  based on the related unpaid Cap Carryover Amount for each such
                  Class; and (2) sequentially, to the Class M-1, Class M-2,
                  Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5 and Class M-6 Certificates, in
                  that order; and

                  (C) to the Class CE Certificates, any remaining amount on
            deposit in the Reserve Account.

            (ii) The Trustee shall account for the Reserve Account as an asset
      of a grantor trust under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of the Code and
      not an asset of any REMIC created pursuant to this Agreement. The
      beneficial owner of the Reserve Account is the Class CE Certificateholder.
      For all federal tax purposes, amounts transferred or reimbursed by REMIC 4
      to the Reserve Account shall be treated as distributions by the Trustee to
      the Class CE Certificateholder.

            (iii) Any Cap Carryover Amounts paid by the Trustee pursuant to this
      Section 3.04(g) to the Offered Certificates shall be accounted for by the
      Trustee as amounts paid first to the Class CE Certificates and then to the
      respective Class or Classes of Offered Certificates. In addition, the
      Trustee shall account for the Offered Certificates' rights to receive
      payments of Cap Carryover Amounts as rights in a limited recourse interest
      rate cap contract written by the Class CE Certificates in favor of the
      Offered Certificates.

            (iv) For federal tax return and information reporting, the right of
      the Holders of the Offered Certificates to receive payments under the
      Yield Maintenance Agreement in respect of any Yield Maintenance Agreement
      Payments shall be assigned a value of zero.

            Section 3.05 Permitted Withdrawals From the Collection Account.

            The Master Servicer may, from time to time, withdraw from the
Collection Account for the following purposes:

            (i) to remit to the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account
      the amounts required to be so remitted pursuant to Section 3.04(b) or
      permitted to be so remitted pursuant to the first sentence of Section
      3.04(d);

            (ii) to reimburse itself for (a) any unreimbursed Advances to the
      extent of amounts received which represent Late Collections (net of the
      related Servicing Fees) of Monthly Payments, Liquidation Proceeds and
      Insurance Proceeds on Mortgage Loans with respect to which such Advances
      were made in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.07; (b) any
      unreimbursed Advances with respect to the final liquidation of a Mortgage
      Loan that are Nonrecoverable Advances, but only to the extent that Late
      Collections, Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance Proceeds received with
      respect to such Mortgage Loan are insufficient to reimburse the Master
      Servicer for such unreimbursed Advances; or (c) subject to Section
      4.07(b), any unreimbursed Advances to the extent of funds held in the
      Collection Account for future distribution that were not included in
      Available Funds for the preceding Distribution Date;

            (iii) to reimburse itself for (a) any unpaid Servicing Fees, (b) any
      unreimbursed Servicing Advances with respect to each Mortgage Loan, but
      only to the extent of any Late Collections, Liquidation Proceeds,
      Insurance Proceeds and condemnation proceeds received with respect to such
      Mortgage Loan, and (c) any Servicing Advances with respect to the final
      liquidation of a Mortgage Loan that are Nonrecoverable Advances, but only
      to the extent that Late Collections, Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance
      Proceeds received with respect to such Mortgage Loan are insufficient to
      reimburse the Master Servicer for Servicing Advances;

            (iv) to reimburse itself for any amounts paid or expenses incurred
      pursuant to Section 3.03 (and not otherwise previously reimbursed);

            (v) to pay to itself as servicing compensation (a) any interest
      earned on funds in the Collection Account (all such interest to be
      withdrawn monthly not later than each Servicer Remittance Date), (b) the
      Servicing Fee from that portion of any payment or recovery as to interest
      to a particular Mortgage Loan to the extent not retained pursuant to
      Section 3.04(ii) and (c) any Prepayment Interest Excess;

            (vi) to pay or reimburse itself for any amounts payable or paid
      pursuant to Section 6.03 (and not otherwise previously reimbursed); and

            (vii) to clear and terminate the Collection Account upon the
      termination of this Agreement.

            The foregoing requirements for withdrawal from the Collection
Account shall be exclusive. In the event the Master Servicer shall deposit in
the Collection Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may
at any time withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision
herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

            Section 3.06 Establishment of Escrow Accounts; Deposits in Escrow
Accounts.

            The Master Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to each Mortgage Loan which constitute Escrow Payments
separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall
establish and maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit
or demand accounts. A copy of such letter agreement shall be furnished to the
Trustee upon request. The Escrow Account shall be an Eligible Account.

            The Master Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts
on a daily basis within one Business Days of receipt, and retain therein, (i)
all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage Loans, for the purpose
of effecting timely payment of any such items as required under the terms of
this Agreement, and (ii) all Insurance Proceeds which are to be applied to the
restoration or repair of any Mortgaged Property. The Master Servicer shall make
withdrawals therefrom only to effect such payments as are required under this
Agreement, and for such other purposes as shall be set forth in, or in
accordance with, Section 3.07. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to retain
any interest paid on funds deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository
institution other than interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to
the Mortgagor and, to the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan or
Applicable Regulations, the Master Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds
to the Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account is non-interest bearing
or that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

            Section 3.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

            Withdrawals from the Escrow Account may be made by the Master
Servicer (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
water rates, fire, flood and hazard insurance premiums and comparable items in a
manner and at a time that assures that the lien priority of the Mortgage is not
jeopardized (or, with respect to the payment of taxes, in a manner and at a time
that avoids the loss of the Mortgaged Property due to a tax sale or the
foreclosure as a result of a tax lien), (ii) to reimburse the Master Servicer
for any Servicing Advance made by the Master Servicer with respect to a related
Mortgage Loan but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which
represent late payments or Late Collections of Escrow Payments thereunder with
respect to taxes and assessments and with respect to hazard insurance, (iii) to
refund to the Mortgagor any funds as may be determined to be overages, (iv) for
transfer to the Collection Account in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
Property, (vi) to pay to the Master Servicer, or to the Mortgagor to the extent
required by the related Mortgage Loan or Applicable Regulations, any interest
paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account, (vii) to clear and terminate
the Escrow Account on the termination of this Agreement, or (viii) to transfer
to the Collection Account any insurance proceeds. As part of its servicing
duties, the Master Servicer shall pay to the Mortgagor interest on funds in the
Escrow Account, to the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan or
Applicable Regulations, and to the extent that interest earned on funds in the
Escrow Account is insufficient, shall pay such interest from its own funds,
without any reimbursement therefor.

            In the event the Master Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account
any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw
such amount from the Escrow Account, any provision herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

            Section 3.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges;
Collections Thereunder.

            With respect to each Mortgage Loan that provides for Escrow
Payments, the Master Servicer shall maintain accurate records reflecting the
status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates and other charges which
are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the status of fire,
flood and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all
bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and shall
effect payment of taxes, assessments, hazard insurance premiums, and comparable
items in a manner and at a time that assures that the lien priority of the
Mortgage is not jeopardized (or, with respect to the payment of taxes, in a
manner and at a time that avoids the loss of the Mortgaged Property due to a tax
sale or the foreclosure as a result of a tax lien). To the extent that the
Mortgage does not provide for Escrow Payments, the Master Servicer shall use its
best efforts to determine that any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at
the time they first become due. If any such payment has not been made and the
Master Servicer receives notice of a tax lien with respect to the Mortgage being
imposed, the Master Servicer will, within 10 business days of such notice,
advance or cause to be advanced funds necessary to discharge such lien on the
Mortgaged Property.

            Section 3.09 Transfer of Accounts.

            The Master Servicer may transfer the Collection Account and the
Escrow Account to a different depository institution from time to time. Upon
such transfer, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee and the
Depositor, a certification or letter agreement, as the case may be, as required
pursuant to Sections 3.04 and 3.06.

            Section 3.10 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

            The Master Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan fire and hazard insurance with extended coverage as is customary in the
area where the Mortgaged Property is located in an amount which is at least
equal to the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to fully compensate for any
damage or loss to the improvements which are a part of such property on a
replacement cost basis or (ii) the Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan, in
each case in an amount not less than such amount as is necessary to prevent the
Mortgagor and/or the Mortgagee from becoming a co-insurer. If the Mortgaged
Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood Emergency
Management Agency as having special flood hazards and flood insurance has been
made available, the Master Servicer will cause to be maintained a flood
insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
Federal Insurance Administration with a generally acceptable insurance carrier,
in an amount representing coverage not less than the least of (i) the Principal
Balance of the Mortgage Loan, (ii) the maximum insurable value of the
improvements securing such Mortgage Loan or (iii) the maximum amount of
insurance which is available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended. The Master Servicer shall also maintain on the REO Property for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, (x) fire and hazard insurance with extended
coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) 100% of the
maximum insurable value of the improvements securing the Mortgage Loan and (ii)
the outstanding Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan at the time it became an
REO Property, (y) public liability insurance and, (z) to the extent required and
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood
insurance in an amount as provided above. Any amounts collected by the Master
Servicer under any such policies other than amounts to be deposited in the
Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
Property or REO Property, or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the
Master Servicer's normal servicing procedures, shall be deposited in the
Collection Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05. It is
understood and agreed that no earthquake or other additional insurance is
required to be maintained by the Master Servicer or the Mortgagor or maintained
on property acquired in respect of the Mortgage Loan, other than pursuant to
such Applicable Regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance. All such policies shall be endorsed with
standard mortgagee clauses with loss payable to the Master Servicer and shall
provide for at least thirty days prior written notice of any cancellation,
reduction in the amount of or material change in coverage to the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom
of choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Master Servicer shall not accept any such insurance policies from
insurance companies unless such companies currently reflect a general policy
rating of B:III or better in Best's Key Rating Guide and are licensed to do
business in the state wherein the property subject to the policy is located.

            Section 3.11 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance Policy.

            In the event that the Master Servicer shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy issued by an insurer that has a general policy rating of B:III or
better in Best's Key Rating Guide insuring against hazard losses on all of the
Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an amount
equal to the amount required pursuant to Section 3.10 and otherwise complies
with all other requirements of Section 3.10, it shall conclusively be deemed to
have satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 3.10, it being understood
and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case the
Master Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on
the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property a policy complying with Section
3.10, and there shall have been a loss which would have been covered by such
policy, deliver to the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account the
amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy because of such deductible
clause, which amount shall not be reimbursable to the Master Servicer from the
Trust Fund. In connection with its activities as servicer of the Mortgage Loans,
the Master Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of the Trustee,
claims under any such blanket policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such policy. Upon request of the Trustee, the Master Servicer shall
cause to be delivered to the Trustee a certified true copy of such policy and a
statement from the insurer thereunder that such policy shall in no event be
terminated or materially modified without thirty days prior written notice to
the Trustee.

            Section 3.12 Fidelity Bond, Errors and Omissions Insurance.

            The Master Servicer shall maintain, at its own expense, a blanket
fidelity bond (the "Fidelity Bond") and an errors and omissions insurance
policy, with broad coverage with financially responsible companies on all
officers, employees or other persons acting in any capacity with regard to the
Mortgage Loans to handle funds, money, documents and papers relating to the
Mortgage Loans. The Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance shall be in
the form of the Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the
Master Servicer against losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud,
errors and omissions and negligent acts of such persons. Such Fidelity Bond
shall also protect and insure the Master Servicer against losses in connection
with the failure to maintain any insurance policies required pursuant to this
Agreement and the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without having
obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No provision of
this Section 3.12 requiring the Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance
shall diminish or relieve the Master Servicer from its duties and obligations as
set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any such bond and
insurance policy shall be at least equal to the corresponding amounts required
by Fannie Mae in the Fannie Mae MBS Selling and Servicing Guide or by Freddie
Mac in the Freddie Mac Servicer's Guide. Upon request of the Trustee, the Master
Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the requesting party a certified true
copy of the Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance policy and a
statement from the surety and the insurer that such Fidelity Bond and errors and
omissions insurance policy shall in no event be terminated or materially
modified without thirty days' prior written notice to the Trustee.

            Section 3.13 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property.

            (a) In the event that title to a Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken (pursuant to a limited power of attorney to be provided by the
Trustee to the Master Servicer) in the name of the Trustee or its nominee, on
behalf of the Certificateholders, or in the event the Trustee is not authorized
or permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the REO Property
is located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax
laws of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an
Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Master Servicer from an attorney duly
licensed to practice law in the state where the REO Property is located. Any
Person or Persons holding such title other than the Trustee shall acknowledge in
writing that such title is being held as nominee for the benefit of the Trustee.

            (b) In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property as
aforesaid or otherwise in connection with a default or imminent default on a
Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall dispose of such REO Property before the
end of the third taxable year beginning after the year of its acquisition by the
Trust Fund for purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code unless the Master
Servicer has received a grant of extension from the Internal Revenue Service of
the above-mentioned grace period such that the holding by the Trust Fund of such
REO Property subsequent to such period will not: (i) result in the imposition of
any tax on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F of the Code; or
(ii) cause any REMIC constituting any part of the Trust Fund to fail to qualify
as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding, in which case the
Trust Fund may continue to hold such REO Property.

            Subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations as shall
at any time be in force, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, no REO Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or
allowed to continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust
Fund in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would: (i) cause such REO
Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code; or (ii) subject any REMIC constituting part of
the Trust Fund to the imposition of any federal income taxes on the income
earned from such REO Property, including any taxes imposed by reason of Sections
860F or 860G(c) of the Code, unless the Master Servicer has agreed to indemnify
and hold harmless the Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any such
taxes.

            The Master Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
REO Property for the Certificateholders and the Trust Fund solely for the
purpose of its prompt disposition and sale in a manner which does not cause such
REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or result in the receipt by the related REMIC of
any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning of Section
860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, or any "net income from foreclosure property" which
is subject to taxation under the REMIC Provisions. The Master Servicer shall
cause each REO Property to be inspected promptly upon the acquisition of title
thereto and shall cause each REO Property to be inspected at least annually
thereafter. The Master Servicer shall make or cause to be made a written or
electronic report of each such inspection. Such reports shall be retained in the
Mortgage File and copies thereof shall be forwarded by the Master Servicer to
the Trustee upon request. The Master Servicer shall attempt to sell the same
(and may temporarily rent the same) on such terms and conditions as the Master
Servicer deems to be in the best interest of the Certificateholders and the
Trust Fund.

            With respect to each REO Property, the Master Servicer shall account
separately for each REO Property with respect to all funds collected and
received in connection with the operation of such REO Property.

            The Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited, on a
daily basis, within one Business Day of receipt, in the Collection Account, all
revenues received with respect to each REO Property and shall withdraw therefrom
funds necessary for the proper operation, management and maintenance of the
related REO Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance
pursuant to Section 3.10 hereof and the fees of any managing agent acting on
behalf of the Master Servicer.

            The Master Servicer shall furnish to the Trustee, on each Servicer
Remittance Date, an operating statement for each REO Property covering the
operation of each REO Property for the previous month. Such operating statement
shall be accompanied by such other information as the Trustee shall reasonably
request.

            The Master Servicer shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as promptly as is practically consistent with protecting the
Certificateholders' interests.

            Each REO Disposition shall be carried out by the Master Servicer at
such price and upon such terms and conditions as the Master Servicer deems to be
in the best interest of the Certificateholders. If as of the date title to any
REO Property was acquired by the Master Servicer there were outstanding
unreimbursed Servicing Advances, Servicing Fees and Advances with respect to the
REO Property, the Master Servicer, upon an REO Disposition of such REO Property,
shall be entitled to reimbursement for any related unreimbursed Servicing
Advances, Servicing Fees and Advances from proceeds received in connection with
such REO Disposition. The proceeds from the REO Disposition, net of any payment
to the Master Servicer as provided above, shall be deposited in the Collection
Account for transfer to the Distribution Account on the succeeding Servicer
Remittance Date in accordance with Section 3.04(a)(vi).

            Any REO Disposition shall be for cash only (unless changes in the
REMIC Provisions made subsequent to the Startup Day allow a sale for other
consideration and an Opinion of Counsel is obtained by the Master Servicer to
the effect that such sale shall not cause any REMIC constituting part of the
Trust Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC).

            Section 3.14 Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption and Substitution
Agreements.

            When a Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be conveyed by the
Mortgagor, the Master Servicer shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such
conveyance or prospective conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate the
maturity of the related Mortgage Loan under any "due-on-sale" clause contained
in the related Mortgage or Mortgage Note; provided, however, that the Master
Servicer shall not exercise any such right if the "due-on-sale" clause, in the
reasonable belief of the Master Servicer, is not enforceable under applicable
law. In such event, the Master Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to enter
into an assumption and modification agreement with the Person to whom such
property has been or is about to be conveyed, pursuant to which such Person
becomes liable under the Mortgage Note and, unless prohibited by applicable law
or the Mortgage, the Mortgagor remains liable thereon. If the foregoing is not
permitted under applicable law, the Master Servicer is authorized to enter into
a substitution of liability agreement with such Person, pursuant to which the
original Mortgagor is released from liability and such Person is substituted as
Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Note; provided that no such substitution
will be permitted unless such person satisfies the underwriting criteria of the
Master Servicer and has a credit score at least equal to that of the original
Mortgagor. The Mortgage Loan, as assumed, shall conform in all respects to the
requirements, representations and warranties of this Agreement. The Master
Servicer shall not take or enter into any assumption and modification agreement,
however, unless (to the extent practicable under the circumstances) it shall
have received confirmation, in writing, of the continued effectiveness of any
applicable hazard insurance policy. The Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee
that any such assumption or substitution agreement has been completed by
forwarding to the Trustee the original copy of such assumption or substitution
agreement (indicating the Mortgage File to which it relates) which copy shall be
added by the Trustee to the related Mortgage File and which shall, for all
purposes, be considered a part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all
other documents and instruments constituting a part thereof. The Master Servicer
shall be responsible for recording any such assumption or substitution
agreements. In connection with any such assumption or substitution agreement,
the Monthly Payment on the related Mortgage Loan shall not be changed but shall
remain as in effect immediately prior to the assumption or substitution, the
stated maturity or outstanding principal amount of such Mortgage Loan shall not
be changed nor shall any required monthly payments of principal or interest be
deferred or forgiven. Any fee collected by the Master Servicer for consenting to
any such conveyance or entering into an assumption or substitution agreement
shall be retained by or paid to the Master Servicer as additional servicing
compensation.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph or any other provision of
this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default, breach
or any other violation of its obligations hereunder by reason of any assumption
of a Mortgage Loan by operation of law or any assumption which the Master
Servicer may be restricted by law from preventing, for any reason whatsoever.

            Section 3.15 Notification of Adjustments.

            On each Adjustment Date, the Master Servicer shall make Mortgage
Interest Rate adjustments for each Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loan in compliance
with the requirements of the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note and Applicable
Regulations. The Master Servicer shall execute and deliver the notices required
by each Mortgage and Mortgage Note and Applicable Regulations regarding Mortgage
Interest Rate adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Master Servicer or the
Trustee that the Master Servicer has failed to adjust or has incorrectly
adjusted a Mortgage Interest Rate or a Monthly Payment pursuant to the terms of
the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the
Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account from its own funds the amount of
any interest loss caused thereby without reimbursement therefor; provided,
however, the Master Servicer shall be held harmless with respect to any Mortgage
Interest Rate adjustments made by any servicer prior to the Master Servicer.

            Section 3.16 Optional Purchases of Mortgage Loans by Master
Servicer.

            The Master Servicer may, at its option, purchase a Mortgage Loan or
REO Property which becomes 90 or more days Delinquent or for which the Master
Servicer has accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Prior to purchase pursuant
to this Section 3.16, the Master Servicer shall be required to continue to make
monthly advances pursuant to Section 4.07. The Master Servicer shall not use any
procedure in selecting Mortgage Loans to be purchased which is materially
adverse to the interests of the Certificateholders. The Master Servicer shall
purchase such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property at a price equal to the
Purchase Price. The Master Servicer will not be entitled to any Servicing Fee
with respect to any such purchased Mortgage Loan. Any such purchase of a
Mortgage Loan or REO Property pursuant to this Section 3.16 shall be
accomplished by delivery to the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account
of the amount of the Purchase Price. The Trustee shall immediately effectuate
the conveyance of such delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property to the Master
Servicer to the extent necessary, including the prompt delivery of all
documentation to the Master Servicer.

            Section 3.17 Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Files.

            (a) Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan (including any
liquidation of such Mortgage Loan through foreclosure or otherwise, or the
receipt by the Master Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be
escrowed in a manner customary for such purposes), the Master Servicer shall
deliver to the Trustee, in written form (with two executed copies) or electronic
form, of a completed "Request for Release" in the form of Exhibit E. Upon
receipt of such Request for Release of Documents, the Trustee shall promptly
release the related Mortgage File within three (3) Business Days via overnight
mail delivery (at the expense of the Master Servicer), in trust, to (i) the
Master Servicer, or (ii) such other party identified in the related Request for
Release. The Trustee agrees to indemnify the Master Servicer, out of its own
funds, for any loss, liability or expense (other than special, indirect,
punitive or consequential damages which will not be paid by the Trustee)
incurred by the Master Servicer as a direct result of the negligence or willful
misconduct by the Trustee in releasing the Mortgage File as provided above. Upon
any such payment in full, or the receipt of such notification that such funds
have been placed in escrow, the Trustee hereby authorizes and empowers the
Master Servicer to execute an instrument of satisfaction (or assignment of
Mortgage without recourse) regarding the Mortgaged Property relating to such
Mortgage, which instrument of satisfaction or assignment shall be delivered to
the Person or Persons entitled thereto against receipt therefor of payment in
full, it being understood and agreed that no expense incurred in connection with
such instrument of satisfaction or assignment, as the case may be, shall be
chargeable to the Collection Account.

            (b) From time to time and as appropriate in the servicing of any
Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, foreclosure or other comparable
conversion of a Mortgage Loan or collection under any insurance policy relating
to a Mortgage Loan, the Trustee shall (except in the case of the payment or
liquidation pursuant to which the related Mortgage File is released to an escrow
agent or an employee, agent or attorney of the Trustee), upon written request of
the Master Servicer and delivery to the Trustee, in written form (with two
executed copies) or electronic form, of a "Request for Release" in the form of
Exhibit E signed by a Servicing Officer, release the related Mortgage File to
the Master Servicer within three (3) Business Days and shall execute such
documents as shall be necessary to the prosecution of any such proceedings,
including, without limitation, an assignment without recourse of the related
Mortgage to the Master Servicer. Such receipt shall obligate the Master Servicer
to return the Mortgage File to the Trustee when the need therefor by the Master
Servicer no longer exists unless the Mortgage Loan shall be liquidated, in which
case, upon receipt of a Request for Release evidencing such liquidation, the
receipt shall be released by the Trustee to the Master Servicer.

            (c) Subject to Section 3.01, the Master Servicer shall have the
right to accept applications of Mortgagors for consent to (i) partial releases
of Mortgages, (ii) alterations, (iii) removal, demolition or division of
properties subject to Mortgages, (iv) modifications, and (v) second mortgage
subordination agreements. No application for approval shall be considered by the
Master Servicer unless: (w) it has received an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to
the Trustee (which opinion shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the Trust
Fund) that such sale, disposition, substitution, acquisition or contribution
will not affect adversely the status of any REMIC constituting part of the Trust
Fund as a REMIC or cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust Fund to be
subject to a tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant to the
REMIC Provisions; (x) the provisions of the related Note and Mortgage have been
complied with; (y) the Combined Loan-to-Value Ratio and debt-to-income ratio
after any release does not exceed the maximum Combined Loan-to-Value Ratio and
debt-to-income ratio established in accordance with the underwriting standards
of the Mortgage Loans; and (z) the lien priority of the related Mortgage is not
affected. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Servicing Officer's certificate
setting forth the action proposed to be taken in respect of a particular
Mortgage Loan and certifying that the criteria set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence have been satisfied, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to
the Master Servicer the consent or partial release so requested by the Master
Servicer. A proposed form of consent or partial release, as the case may be,
shall accompany any Servicing Officer's certificate delivered by the Master
Servicer pursuant to this paragraph.

            Section 3.18 Servicing Compensation.

            As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Master Servicer
shall be entitled to retain the amount of the Servicing Fee with respect to each
Mortgage Loan (including REO Properties) and any Prepayment Interest Excess. The
Master Servicer shall be entitled to retain additional servicing compensation in
the form of release fees, bad check charges, assumption fees, modification or
extension fees, late payment charges, prepayment charges that are not Prepayment
Charges, Originator Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts or Servicer Prepayment
Charge Payment Amounts, or any other service-related fees and similar items, to
the extent collected from Mortgagors.

            Section 3.19 Annual Statement as to Compliance.

            (a) The Master Servicer, at its own expense, will deliver to the
Trustee and the Depositor, not later than 60 days following the end of each
calendar year, a Servicing Officer's certificate stating, as to each signer
thereof, that (i) a review of the activities of the Master Servicer during such
preceding fiscal year and of performance under this Agreement has been made
under such officers' supervision, and (ii) to the best of such officers'
knowledge, based on such review, the Master Servicer has fulfilled all its
obligations under this Agreement for such year, or, if there has been a default
in the fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each such default known
to such officers and the nature and status thereof including the steps being
taken by the Master Servicer to remedy such default.

            (b) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the
Trustee is for informational purposes only and their receipt of such shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable, from information contained therein, including the Master
Servicer's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

            Section 3.20 Annual Independent Certified Public Accountants'
Reports.

            (a) Not later than 60 days following the end of each calendar year,
the Master Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants to furnish to the Trustee, the
Depositor and each Rating Agency, a report stating that (i) it has obtained a
letter of representation regarding certain matters from the management of the
Master Servicer which includes an assertion that the Master Servicer has
complied with certain minimum residential mortgage loan servicing standards,
identified in either the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers
established by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America or the Audit Program
for Mortgages serviced by Freddie Mac, with respect to the servicing of
residential mortgage loans during the most recently completed fiscal year and
(ii) on the basis of an examination conducted by such firm in accordance with
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
such representation is fairly stated in all material respects, subject to such
exceptions and other qualifications that may be appropriate. Copies of such
statement shall be provided by the Trustee to any Certificateholder upon
request, provided that such statement is delivered by the Master Servicer to the
Trustee.

            (b) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the
Trustee is for informational purposes only and their receipt of such shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Master Servicer's
compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

            Section 3.21 Access to Certain Documentation and Information
Regarding the Mortgage Loans.

            The Master Servicer shall provide to the Trustee, Certificateholders
that are federally insured savings and loan associations, the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the FDIC and the supervisory agents and examiners of each of the
foregoing (which, in the case of supervisory agents and examiners, may be
required by applicable state and federal regulations) access to the available
documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans, such access being afforded without
charge but only upon reasonable advance request and during normal business hours
at the offices of the Master Servicer designated by it.

            Section 3.22 Duties of Credit Risk Manager.

            For and on behalf of the Depositor, the Credit Risk Manager shall
provide reports and recommendations as to loss mitigation activities concerning
Mortgage Loans that are past due, are in default, as to which there has been
commencement of foreclosure, as to which there has been forbearance in exercise
of remedies, as to which any obligor is the subject of bankruptcy, receivership,
or an arrangement of creditors, or which have become REO Properties. Such
reports and recommendations will be based upon information provided pursuant to
the Credit Risk Management Agreement. The Credit Risk Manager shall look solely
to the Master Servicer for all information and data (including loss and
delinquency information and data) and loan-level information and data relating
to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans.

            The Credit Risk Manager may be removed at any time by a vote of
Certificateholders holding Certificates evidencing at least 66 2/3% of the
aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates. After any such termination, the
Credit Risk Manager shall have no further obligations hereunder, and shall no
longer be entitled to the Credit Risk Manager Fee.

            Section 3.23 Obligations of the Master Servicer in Respect of
Compensating Interest.

            Not later than the close of business on each Servicer Remittance
Date, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee for deposit in the
Distribution Account an amount ("Compensating Interest") equal to the lesser of
(A) the aggregate of the Prepayment Interest Shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans
for the related Distribution Date resulting from Principal Prepayments on the
Mortgage Loans during the related Prepayment Period and (B) the sum of (i) its
aggregate Servicing Fee received in the related Collection Period, (ii) any
interest or investment income earned on funds deposited in the Collection
Account during the related Prepayment Period and (iii) and any Prepayment
Interest Excess for the related Distribution Date. The Master Servicer shall
apply Compensating Interest to offset any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls on the
Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer shall not have the right to reimbursement
for any amounts remitted to the Trustee in respect of Compensating Interest.
Such amounts so remitted shall be included in the Available Funds and
distributed therewith on the next Distribution Date. The Master Servicer shall
not be obligated to pay Compensating Interest with respect to Relief Act
Interest Shortfalls.

            Section 3.24 Obligations of the Master Servicer in Respect of
Mortgage Interest Rates and Monthly Payments.

            In the event that a shortfall in any collection on or liability with
respect to any Mortgage Loan results from or is attributable to adjustments to
Mortgage Interest Rates, Monthly Payments or Principal Balances that were made
by the Master Servicer in a manner not consistent with the terms of the related
Mortgage Note and this Agreement, the Master Servicer, upon discovery or receipt
of notice thereof, immediately shall deliver to the Trustee for deposit in the
Distribution Account from its own funds the amount of any such shortfall and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor and
any successor servicer in respect of any such liability. Such indemnities shall
survive the termination or discharge of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 3.24 shall not limit the ability of the Master Servicer
to seek recovery of any such amounts from the related Mortgagor under the terms
of the related Mortgage Note, as permitted by law.

            Section 3.25 Investment of Funds in the Collection Account and the
Distribution Account.

            (a) The Master Servicer may direct any depository institution
maintaining the Collection Account and the Trustee may direct any depository
institution maintaining the Distribution Account (for purposes of this Section
3.25, each an "Investment Account"), to invest the funds in such Investment
Account in one or more Eligible Investments bearing interest or sold at a
discount, and maturing, unless payable on demand, (i) no later than the Business
Day immediately preceding the date on which such funds are required to be
withdrawn from such account pursuant to this Agreement, if a Person other than
the Trustee is the obligor thereon, and (ii) no later than the date on which
such funds are required to be withdrawn from such account pursuant to this
Agreement, if the Trustee is the obligor thereon or if such investment is
managed or advised by the Trustee of an Affiliate. All such Eligible Investments
shall be held to maturity, unless payable on demand. Any investment of funds in
an Investment Account shall be made in the name of the Trustee or the Master
Servicer, as applicable (in its capacity as such) or in the name of a nominee of
the Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to sole possession (except with
respect to investment direction of funds held in the Collection Account) over
each such investment and the income thereon, and any certificate or other
instrument evidencing any such investment shall be delivered directly to the
Trustee or its agent, together with any document of transfer necessary to
transfer title to such investment to the Trustee or its nominee. In the event
amounts on deposit in an Investment Account are at any time invested in an
Eligible Investment payable on demand, the Trustee shall at the direction of the
Master Servicer:

                  (x)   consistent with any notice required to be given
                        thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the
                        last day such Eligible Investment may otherwise mature
                        hereunder in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) all
                        amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount
                        required to be withdrawn on such date; and

                  (y)   demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly
                        upon determination by a Responsible Officer of the
                        Trustee that such Eligible Investment would not
                        constitute an Eligible Investment in respect of funds
                        thereafter on deposit in the Investment Account.

            (b) All income and gain realized from the investment of funds in the
Collection Account shall be for the benefit of the Master Servicer. The Master
Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account or (to the extent funds in the
Escrow Account are invested if permitted by applicable law) the Escrow Account,
as applicable, the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any such Eligible
Investment made with funds in such account immediately upon realization of such
loss. All income and gain realized from the investment of funds in the
Distribution Account shall be for the benefit of the Trustee. The Trustee shall
deposit in the Distribution Account the amount of any loss incurred on Eligible
Investments in the Distribution Account.

            (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any
default occurs in the making of a payment due under any Eligible Investment, or
if a default occurs in any other performance required under any Eligible
Investment, the Trustee may and, subject to Section 8.01 and Section 8.02(a)(v),
upon the request of the Holders of Certificates representing more than 50% of
the Voting Rights allocated to any Class of Certificates, shall take such action
as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including the
institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings.

            The Trustee shall not in any way be held liable by reason of any
insufficiency in any Account held by the Trustee resulting from any investment
loss on any Eligible Investment included therein (except to the extent that the
Trustee is the obligor and has defaulted thereon).

            Section 3.26 Liability of Master Servicer; Indemnification.

            (a) Subject to clause (b) below and Section 6.03, the Master
Servicer (except the Trustee if it is required to succeed the Master Servicer
hereunder) indemnifies and holds the Trustee, the Depositor and the Trust Fund
harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees
and expenses that the Trustee, the Depositor and the Trust Fund may sustain in
any way related to the failure of the Master Servicer to perform its duties and
service the Mortgage Loans in compliance with the Servicing Standard. The Master
Servicer shall immediately notify the Trustee and the Depositor if a claim is
made that may result in such claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
legal fees or related costs, judgments, or any other costs, fees and expenses,
and the Master Servicer shall assume (with the consent of the Trustee) the
defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith,
including reasonable counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against the Master Servicer, the
Trustee, the Depositor and/or the Trust Fund in respect of such claim. The
provisions of this Section 3.26 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the outstanding Certificates.

            (b) None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, or any of the
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Depositor or the Master Servicer
shall be under any liability to the Trust Fund or the Certificateholders for any
action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action, in good faith
pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that
this provision shall not protect the Depositor or the Master Servicer or any
such Person against any breach of warranties or representations made by such
party herein, or against any specific liability imposed on the Master Servicer
for a breach of the Servicing Standard and/or this Agreement, or against any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of its respective willful
misfeasance, bad faith, fraud or negligence in the performance of its duties or
by reasons of negligent disregard of its respective obligations or duties
hereunder.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Depositor or the Master Servicer, may rely in good
faith on any document of any kind which, prima facie, is properly executed and
submitted by any appropriate Person with respect to any matters arising
hereunder. The Depositor, the Master Servicer and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Depositor or the Master Servicer shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Trust against any loss, liability or expense incurred
in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement or the
Certificates, other than any loss, liability or expense incurred in connection
with any legal action incurred by reason of its respective misfeasance, bad
faith, fraud or negligence, a breach of a representation or warranty made by
such party hereunder or (in the case of the Master Servicer) a breach of the
Servicing Standard in the performance of its respective duties or by reason of
negligent disregard of its respective obligations or duties hereunder. Neither
the Depositor nor the Master Servicer shall be under any obligation to appear
in, prosecute or defend any legal action unless such action is related to its
respective duties under this Agreement and in its opinion does not expose it to
any expense or liability; provided, however, that the Depositor or the Master
Servicer may in their discretion undertake any action related to their
obligations hereunder which they may deem necessary or desirable with respect to
this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto and the interests
of the Certificateholders hereunder. The Master Servicer's right to indemnity or
reimbursement pursuant to this Section shall survive any resignation or
termination of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04 or 7.01 with respect
to any losses, expenses, costs or liabilities arising prior to such resignation
or termination (or arising from events that occurred prior to such resignation
or termination).

            Section 3.27 Reports of Foreclosure and Abandonment of Mortgaged
Properties.

            Beginning in 2004, the Master Servicer shall file the reports of
foreclosure and abandonment of any Mortgaged Property required by Section 6050J
of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service on or before the due date for any
such report. Not later than 90 days following the end of each calendar year,
beginning in 2004, the Master Servicer will deliver an Officer's Certificate to
the Trustee certifying its compliance with this Section 3.27. The reports from
the Master Servicer shall be in form and substance sufficient to meet the
reporting requirements imposed by such Section 6050J.

            Section 3.28 Protection of Assets.

            (a) Except for transactions and activities entered into in
connection with the securitization that is the subject of this Agreement, the
Trust is not authorized and has no power to:

            (1) borrow money or issue debt;

            (2) merge with another entity, reorganize, liquidate or sell assets;
or

            (3) engage in any business or activities.

            (b) Each party to this Agreement agrees that it will not file an
involuntary bankruptcy petition against the Trustee or the Trust Fund or
initiate any other form of insolvency proceeding until after the Certificates
have been paid.

            Section 3.29 Limitation of Liability of the Credit Risk Manager.

            Neither the Credit Risk Manager, nor any of the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Credit Risk Manager, shall be under any liability to
the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the Certificateholders for
any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith
pursuant to this Agreement, in reliance upon information provided by the Master
Servicer under the Credit Risk Management Agreement or for errors in judgment;
provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Credit Risk Manager
or any such person against liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason
of willful malfeasance, bad faith or negligence in its performance of its duties
or by reason of reckless disregard for its obligations and duties under this
Agreement or the applicable Credit Risk Management Agreement. The Credit Risk
Manager and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Credit Risk Manager
may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed
and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder, and may
rely in good faith upon the accuracy of information furnished by the Master
Servicer pursuant to the applicable Credit Risk Management Agreement in the
performance of its duties thereunder and hereunder.

            Section 3.30 No Personal Solicitation.

            From and after the Closing Date, the Master Servicer agrees that it
will not take any action or permit or cause any action to be taken by any of its
agents and Affiliates, or by any independent contractors or independent mortgage
brokerage companies on the Master Servicer's behalf, to personally, by
telephone, mail or electronic mail, solicit the Mortgagor under any Mortgage
Loan for the purpose of refinancing such Mortgage Loan; provided, that the
Master Servicer may solicit any Mortgagor for whom the Master Servicer has
received a request for verification of mortgage, a request for demand for
payoff, a mortgagor initiated written or verbal communication indicating a
desire to prepay the related Mortgage Loan, or the mortgagor initiates a title
search; provided further, it is understood and agreed that promotions undertaken
by the Master Servicer or any of its Affiliates which (i) concern optional
insurance products or other additional products or (ii) are directed to the
general public at large, including, without limitation, mass mailings based on
commercially acquired mailing lists, newspaper, radio and television
advertisements shall not constitute solicitation under this Section, nor is the
Master Servicer prohibited from responding to unsolicited requests or inquiries
made by a Mortgagor or an agent of a Mortgagor. Furthermore, the Master Servicer
shall be permitted to include in its monthly statements to borrowers or
otherwise, statements regarding the availability of the Master Servicer's
counseling services with respect to refinancing mortgage loans.

            Section 3.31 Periodic Filings.

            (a) The Trustee and the Master Servicer shall reasonably cooperate
with the Depositor in connection with the Trust's satisfying its reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Trustee shall prepare on behalf of the Trust any monthly Current
Reports on Form 8-K (each, a "Monthly Form 8-K") and Annual Reports on Form 10-K
(each, a "Form 10-K") customary for similar securities as required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder, and the Trustee shall sign (other than any Form 10-K) and
file (via the Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering and
Retrieval System) such Forms on behalf of the Trust. The Depositor shall sign
any Form 10-K.

            (b) Each Monthly Form 8-K shall be filed by the Trustee within 15
days after each Distribution Date, including a copy of the Distribution Date
Statement for such Distribution Date as an exhibit thereto. Prior to March 30th
of each year (or such earlier date as may be required by the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission), the
Trustee shall file a Form 10-K, in substance as required by applicable law or
applicable Securities and Exchange Commission staff's interpretations. Such Form
10-K shall include as exhibits the Master Servicer's annual statement of
compliance described under Section 3.19 and the accountant's report described
under Section 3.20, in each case, to the extent they have been timely delivered
to the Trustee. If they are not so timely delivered, the Trustee shall file an
amended Form 10-K including such documents as exhibits reasonably promptly after
they are delivered to the Trustee. The Trustee shall have no liability with
respect to any failure to properly prepare or file such periodic reports
resulting from or relating to the Trustee's inability or failure to obtain any
information not resulting from its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith. The Form 10-K shall also include a certification in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit O (the "Certification"), which shall be signed by a senior
officer of the Depositor in charge of securitization. The Depositor shall
deliver the Certification to the Trustee three (3) Business Days prior to the
latest date on which the Form 10-K may be timely filed. The Trustee, the
Depositor and the Master Servicer shall reasonably cooperate to enable the
Securities and Exchange Commission requirements with respect to the Trust to be
met in the event that the Securities and Exchange Commission issues additional
interpretive guidelines or promulgates rules or regulations, or in the event of
any other change of law that would require reporting arrangements or the
allocation of responsibilities with respect thereto, as described in this
Section 3.31, to be conducted or allocated in a different manner.

            (c) Prior to the latest date on which the Form 10-K may be timely
filed each year, (i) the Trustee shall sign and deliver to the Depositor a
certification (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit P-1) for the benefit of
the Depositor and its officers, directors and Affiliates (provided, however,
that the Trustee shall not undertake an analysis of the accountant's report
attached as an exhibit to the Form 10-K) and (ii) the Master Servicer shall sign
and deliver to the Depositor a certification (in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit P-2) for the benefit of the Depositor and its officers, directors and
Affiliates. In addition, (i) the Trustee shall also indemnify and hold harmless
the Depositor and its officers, directors and Affiliates from and against any
losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal
fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out of or
based upon any inaccuracy in the certification provided by the Trustee pursuant
to this Section 3.31(c), any breach of the Trustee's obligations under this
Section 3.31(c) or the Trustee's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in
connection therewith and (ii) the Master Servicer shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Depositor and its officers, directors and Affiliates from and
against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and
necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses
arising out of or based upon any inaccuracy in the certification provided by the
Master Servicer pursuant to this Section 3.31(c), any breach of the Master
Servicer's obligations under this Section 3.31(c) or the Master Servicer's
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith. If the
indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold
harmless the Depositor and its officers, directors and Affiliates, then (i) the
Trustee agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Depositor, its officers, directors or Affiliates as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities of the Depositor, its officers, directors or

allocated against the Class M-6, Class M-5, Class M-4, Class M-3, Class M-2 and

Principal Balances thereof are reduced to zero. In addition, if after giving
effect to the distribution of the Principal Distribution Amount on any

1 Mortgage Loans as of the end of the related Collection Period, such excess

Percentage Interests evidenced by the Certificates held by such
Certificateholders.

procedures. Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such
distribution to the Certificate Owners that it represents and to each indirect
participating brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm" or "indirect participating

and disbursements with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate are to be made by the
Depository and the Depository Participants in accordance with the provisions of

            Section 4.07 Remittance Reports; Advances.

            (a) On the second Business Day following each Determination Date,
the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee by telecopy (or by such other
means as the Master Servicer and the Trustee may agree from time to time) a
Remittance Report with respect to the related Distribution Date. On the same
date, the Master Servicer shall electronically forward to the Trustee in such
medium as may be agreed between the Master Servicer and the Trustee the
information set forth in such Remittance Report with respect to the related
Distribution Date and such information reasonably available to the Master
Servicer necessary in order for the Trustee to perform the calculations
necessary to make the distributions contemplated by Section 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03
and to prepare the Distribution Date Statement. The Trustee shall not be
responsible to recompute, recalculate or verify any information provided to it
by the Master Servicer.

            (b) The amount of Advances to be made by the Master Servicer for any
Distribution Date shall equal, subject to Section 4.07(d), the sum of (i) the
aggregate amount of Monthly Payments (net of the related Servicing Fee), due
during the related Collection Period in respect of the Mortgage Loans, which
Monthly Payments were delinquent on a contractual basis as of the close of
business on the related Determination Date and (ii) with respect to each REO
Property, which REO Property was acquired during or prior to the related
Collection Period and as to which REO Property an REO Disposition did not occur
during the related Collection Period, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
the REO Imputed Interest on such REO Property for such Collection Period, over
the net income from such REO Property transferred to the Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 3.13 for distribution on such Distribution Date.

            On or before 1:00 p.m. New York time on the Servicer Remittance
Date, the Master Servicer shall remit in immediately available funds to the
Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of Advances, if any, to be made in respect of the Mortgage Loans for the
related Distribution Date either (i) from its own funds or (ii) from the
Collection Account, to the extent of funds held therein for future distribution
(in which case it will cause to be made an appropriate entry in the records of
the Collection Account that amounts held for future distribution have been, as
permitted by this Section 4.07, used by the Master Servicer in discharge of any
such Advance) or (iii) in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii)
aggregating the total amount of Advances to be made by the Master Servicer with
respect to the Mortgage Loans. Any amounts held for future distribution and so
used shall be appropriately reflected in the Master Servicer's records and
replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account on or
before any future Servicer Remittance Date to the extent that the Available
Funds for the related Distribution Date (determined without regard to Advances
to be made on the Servicer Remittance Date) shall be less than the total amount
that would be distributed to the Classes of Certificateholders pursuant to
Section 4.01 and 4.02 on such Distribution Date if such amounts held for future
distributions had not been so used to make Advances. The Trustee will provide
notice to the Master Servicer by telecopy by the close of business on any
Servicer Remittance Date in the event that the amount remitted by the Master
Servicer to the Trustee on such date is less than the Advances required to be
made by the Master Servicer for the related Distribution Date, as set forth in
the related Remittance Report.

            (c) The obligation of the Master Servicer to make such Advances is
mandatory, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but subject to
(d) below, and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, shall continue until the
earlier of such time as the Trust acquires title to the related Mortgaged
Property or such Mortgage Loan is paid in full by the Mortgagor or disposed of
by the Trust, or until the recovery of all Liquidation Proceeds thereon.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Advance or
Servicing Advance shall be required to be made hereunder by the Master Servicer
if such Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance. The
determination by the Master Servicer that it has made a Nonrecoverable Advance
or that any proposed Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable
Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officers' Certificate of the Master Servicer
delivered to the Depositor and the Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to
conclusively rely upon any such determination by the Master Servicer.

            Section 4.08 REMIC Distributions.

            (a) REMIC 4. On each Distribution Date, the timing and amounts of
principal and interest distributions and allocations of Applied Realized Loss
Amounts and Realized Loss Amortization Amounts on each Class of REMIC 4 Regular
Interests (other than the REMIC 4 Components) shall be identical to the timing,
amounts and allocations on the corresponding Classes of Certificates (other than
the Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates), except that the Pass-Through
Rate of any REMIC 4 Regular Interest shall not exceed the pass-through rate as
set forth in the definition thereof, and any amount paid in respect of a Class
of Offered Certificates as a Cap Carryover Amount (other than from any Yield
Maintenance Agreement Payment), whether with respect to the Distribution Date on
which such amount is paid or a prior Distribution Date, shall be treated as a
distribution by REMIC 4 in respect of the REMIC 4 Components, beneficially owned
by the Class CE Certificates, then as paid by the Class CE Certificates to the
applicable Class of Offered Certificates as a payment from the Grantor Trust
outside of the REMICs. Interest (and in the case of the Class T4-4 Interest,
principal) shall be deemed distributed to each Class of REMIC 4 Components as
follows: (i) the Class T4-11, Class T4-12 and Class T4-13 Interests shall be
entitled to all distributions on the Class T3-11, Class T3-12 and Class T3-13
Interests, respectively; (ii) the Class T4-4 Interest shall be entitled to all
distributions on the Class T3-4, T3-101 and T3-102 Interests; (iii) the Class

Class T3-A1A, Class T3-A2, Class T3-A3, Class T3-M1, Class T3-M2, Class T3-M3,
Class T3-M4, Class T3-M5 and Class T3-M6 Interests over interest distributable
on the Class T4-A1, Class T4-A1A, Class T4-A2, Class T4-A3, Class T4-M1, Class
T4-M2, Class T4-M3, Class T4-M4, Class T4-M5 and Class T4-M6 Interests,
respectively; (iv) on any Distribution Date on which the Pool Cap exceeds the
Class A-1 REMIC Pass-Through Rate, the Class T4-A1IO Interest shall be entitled
to a specified portion of interest payments consisting of the excess of interest
distributable on the Class T3-A1 Interest over the interest distributable on the
portion of the Class T4-A1 Interest corresponding to the Class T3-A1 Interest;
and (v) on any Distribution Date on which the Pool Cap exceeds the Class A-2
REMIC Pass-Through Rate, the Class T4-A2IO Interest shall be entitled to a
specified portion of interest payments consisting of the excess of interest
distributable on the Class T3-A2 Interest over the interest distributable on the
portion of the Class T4-A2 Interest corresponding to the Class T3-A2 Interest.
Any shortfalls of interest, including any Realized Losses allocated to reduce
the Subsequent Overcollateralization Amount, shall be borne, first, by the REMIC
4 Components, pro rata based on interest accrued, before being allocated to the
applicable other REMIC 4 Regular Interests. Realized Losses allocated to the
Class T4-4 Interest shall equal Realized Losses allocated to the Class T3-4,
Class T3-101 and Class T3-102 Interests pursuant to Section 4.08(b). The Class
CE Certificates shall be deemed to receive the aggregate of the amounts
distributable in respect of the REMIC 4 Components, notwithstanding that a
portion of such amount is applied to pay any Cap Carryover Amount. Amounts
deemed distributed in respect of the Class T4-A1, Class T-4A1A, Class T4-A2,
Class T4-A3, Class T4-M1, Class T4-M2, Class T4-M3, Class T4-M4, Class T4-M5 and
Class T4-M6 Interests shall be treated as held by the Grantor Trust for
distribution in accordance with Sections 4.01 and 4.02. Any portion of the
Available Funds remaining in REMIC 4 on a Distribution Date shall be distributed
to the Class R Certificate in respect of the Class R-4 Interest.

            (b) REMIC 3. On each Distribution Date, the timing and amounts of
principal and interest distributions and allocations of Applied Realized Loss
Amounts and Realized Loss Amortization Amounts on the Classes of REMIC 3 Regular
Interests identified as Corresponding Classes shall be identical to the timing,
amounts and allocations in respect of Corresponding Classes of REMIC 4 Regular
Interests pursuant to Section 4.08(a). The Class T3-4 Interest shall be entitled
to all distributions on the Class T2-4 Interest. The Class T3-101 Interest shall
be entitled to all distributions of principal and interest on the Class T2-101
Interest. The Class T3-102 Interest shall be entitled to all distributions of
principal and interest on the Class T2-102 Interest. Interest shortfalls will
reduce interest payable, first, on the Class T3-4, Class T3-101 and Class T3-102
Interests, pro rata; second, on the Class T3-11, Class T3-12 and Class T3-13
Interests, pro rata; third, on the Class T3-M6, Class T3-M5, Class T3-M4, Class
T3-M3, Class T3-M2 and Class T3-M1 Interests, in that order; and fourth, on the
Class T3-A1, Class T3-A1A, Class T3-A2 and Class T3-A3 Interests, pro rata;
provided, that the portion of the interest payable on the Class T3-M6, Class
T3-M5, Class T3-M4, Class T3-M3, Class T3-M2, Class T3-M1, Class T3-A1, Class
T3-A1A, Class T3-A2 and Class T3-A3 Interests attributable to the Class T4-M6IO,
Class T4-M5IO, Class T4-M4IO, Class T4-M3IO, Class T4-M2IO, Class T4-M1IO, Class
T4-A1IO, Class T4-A1AIO, Class T4-A2IO and Class T4-A3IO Interests shall bear
interest shortfalls pro rata and prior to the allocation of any remaining
shortfalls to such Interests. Amounts of principal and interest distributed in
respect of, and Realized Losses allocated to, the Class T3-4, Class T3-101 and
Class T3-102 Interests shall equal the allocations made to the Class T2-4, Class
T2-101 and Class T2-102 Interests, respectively, reduced by any allocation of
interest shortfalls to the Class T3-4, Class T3-101 and Class T3-102 Interests
pursuant to the preceding sentence. Amounts in the Distribution Account deemed
distributed in respect of the REMIC 3 Regular Interests shall be treated as held
by REMIC 4 for distribution in accordance with Sections 4.08(a). Any portion of
Available Funds remaining in REMIC 3 on a Distribution Date shall be distributed
to the Class R Certificate in respect of the Class R-3 Interest.

            (c) REMIC 2. On each Distribution Date, the timing and amounts of
principal distributions and allocations of Realized Losses on each Class of
REMIC 2 Regular Interests shall be identical to the timing, amounts and
allocations in respect of the corresponding Classes of REMIC 1 Regular Interests
pursuant to Section 4.08(d). For these purposes, the Class T2-1 and Class T2-11
Interests correspond to the Class T1-1 Interest, the Class T2-2 and Class T2-12
Interests correspond to the Class T1-2 Interest, the Class T2-3 and Class T2-13
Interests correspond to the Class T1-3 Interest, the Class T2-101 Interest
corresponds to the Class T1-101 Interest, the Class T2-102 Interest corresponds
to the Class T1-102 Interest and the Class T2-4 Interest corresponds to the
Class T1-4 Interest. Interest will accrue on each of the Class T2-1, Class T2-2
and Class T2-3 Interests at the REMIC 2 Pass-Through Rate. Interest will accrue
on each of the Class T2-11, Class T2-12 and Class T2-13 Interests at the excess,
if any, of the Pool Cap over the REMIC 2 Pass-Through Rate. Interest will accrue
on the Class T2-101 Interest at the Group 1 Cap. Interest will accrue on the
Class T2-102 Interest at the Group 2 Cap. Interest will accrue on the Class T2-4
Interest at the Pool Cap. Any shortfalls of interest will be allocated, first,
pro rata, to the Class T2-4, Class T2-101 and Class T2-102 Interests; second,
pro rata, to the Class T2-11, Class T2-12 and Class T2-13 Interests; and third,
pro rata, to the Class T2-1, Class T2-2 and Class T2-3 Interests. Amounts in the
Distribution Account deemed distributed in respect of the REMIC 2 Regular
Interests shall be treated as held by REMIC 3 for distribution in accordance
with Section 4.08(b). Any portion of Available Funds remaining in REMIC 2 on a
Distribution Date shall be distributed to the Class R Certificate in respect of
the Class R-2 Interest.

            (d) REMIC 1. On each Distribution Date, the REMIC 1 Regular
Interests shall receive distributions of interest and principal equal in the
aggregate to amounts distributable pursuant to Sections 4.01 and 4.02 (other
than to the Class R Certificate in respect of the Class R-4 Interest) from
amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account. Such amounts with respect to
interest shall accrue (i) at the Pool Cap on the Class T1-1, Class T1-2, Class
T1-3 and Class T1-4 Regular Interests, (ii) at the Group 1 Cap with respect to
the Class T1-101 Interest and (iii) at the Group 2 Cap with respect to the Class
T1-102 Interest. Any shortfalls of interest will be allocated first, to the
Class T1-4 Interest, and then to the Class T1-1, Class T1-101, Class T1-102,
Class T1-2 and Class T1-3 Interests, pro rata based on interest accrued. Amounts
in reduction of principal balance of the REMIC 1 Regular Interests shall be
allocated so that the principal balances of the Class T1-1, Class T1-101, Class
T1-102, Class T1-2 and Class T1-3 Interests equal the amounts specified in the
definitions thereof in Article I. Realized Losses shall be allocated first to
the Class T1-4, Class T1-101 and Class T1-102 Interests pursuant to Section
4.08(e) and then pro rata to the Class T1-1, Class T1-101, Class T1-102, Class
T1-2 and Class T1-3 Interests. Such amounts with respect to principal and any
Realized Losses with respect to principal shall reduce the principal balances of
the REMIC 1 Regular Interests so that, in the aggregate, such balances
correspond to the Pool Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the
related Collection Period. Amounts in the Distribution Account deemed
distributed in respect of the REMIC 1 Regular Interests shall be treated as held
by REMIC 2 for distribution in accordance with Section 4.08(c). Any amounts
remaining in REMIC 1 on a Distribution Date shall be distributed to the Class R
Certificate in respect of the Class R-1 Interest.

            (e) Any principal distributions or Realized Losses allocated to the
Class T1-4, Class T1-101 and Class T1-102 Interests pursuant to Section 4.08(d),
to the Class T2-4, Class T2-101 and Class T2-102 Interests pursuant to Section
4.08(c), or to the Class T3-4, Class T3-101 and Class T3-102 Interests pursuant
to Section 4.08(b) shall be allocated so that the weighted average of (i) the
Class T1-4, Class T1-101 and Class T1-102 Interests, (ii) the Class T2-4, Class
T2-101 and Class T2-102 Interests, and (iii) Class T3-4, Class T3-101 and Class
T3-102 Interests, as applicable, equals the Pool Cap.

            (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
above distributions in this Section 4.08 (other than on the Certificates) are
deemed distributions, and distributions of funds from the Distribution Account
shall be made only in accordance with Sections 4.01 and 4.02 hereof.

                                THE CERTIFICATES

            Section 5.01 The Certificates.

            Each of the Class A-1, Class A-1A, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1,
Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-4, Class M-6, Class CE, Class P and
Class R Certificates shall be substantially in the forms annexed hereto as
exhibits, and shall, on original issue, be executed by the Trustee and
authenticated and delivered by the Certificate Registrar to or upon the receipt
of a Written Order to Authenticate from the Depositor concurrently with the sale
and assignment to the Trustee of the Trust Fund. Each Class of the Offered
Certificates shall be initially evidenced by one or more Certificates
representing a Percentage Interest with a minimum dollar (or notional amount)
denomination of $25,000 and integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The
Class CE and Class P Certificates are issuable only in minimum Percentage
Interests of 10%. The Class R Certificate is issuable only as a single
certificate.

            The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual
or facsimile signature on behalf of the Trustee by a Responsible Officer.
Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were,
at the time when such signatures were affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of
the Trustee shall bind the Trust, notwithstanding that such individuals or any
of them have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery
of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such
Certificate. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Agreement or be valid for any purpose, unless such Certificate shall have been
manually authenticated by the Certificate Registrar substantially in the form
provided for herein, and such authentication upon any Certificate shall be
conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Certificates shall be dated the date
of their authentication. Subject to Section 5.02(c), the Offered Certificates
shall be Book-Entry Certificates. The Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates
shall not be Book-Entry Certificates but shall be issued in fully registered
certificate form.

            Section 5.02 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.

            (a) The Certificate Registrar shall cause to be kept at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a Certificate Register in which, subject
to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Certificate Registrar
shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and
exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The Trustee shall initially serve
as Certificate Registrar for the purpose of registering Certificates and
transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The Trustee as
Certificate Registrar shall be subject to the same standards of care,
limitations on liability and rights to indemnity as the Trustee, and the
provisions of Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, 8.04, 8.05, 8.14, 8.15 and 8.16 shall
apply to the Certificate Registrar to the same extent as they apply to the
Trustee. Any Certificate Registrar appointed in accordance with this Section
5.02(a) may at any time resign by giving at least 30 days' advance written
notice of resignation to the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Depositor,
such resignation to become effective upon appointment of a successor Certificate
Registrar.

            Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at
any office or agency of the Certificate Registrar maintained for such purpose
pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and, in the case of the Class R Certificate,
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth below, the Trustee on behalf of
the Trust shall execute and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
new Certificates of the same aggregate Percentage Interest.

            At the option of the Certificateholders, Certificates may be
exchanged for other Certificates in authorized denominations and the same
aggregate Percentage Interests, upon surrender of the Certificates to be
exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange, the Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust and
the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver the Certificates which
the Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every
Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange
shall (if so required by the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar) be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer satisfactory
to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

            (b) Upon original issuance, the Book-Entry Certificates shall be
issued in the form of one or more typewritten certificates, to be delivered to
the Depository, the initial Depository, by, or on behalf of, the Depositor; or
to, and deposited with the Certificate Custodian, on behalf of the Depository,
if directed to do so pursuant to instructions from the Depository. Except as
provided in paragraph (c) below, the Book-Entry Certificates shall at all times
remain registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee and at all times:
(i) registration of such Certificates may not be transferred by the Trustee
except to another Depository; (ii) the Depository shall maintain book-entry
records with respect to the Certificate Owners and with respect to ownership and
transfers of such Certificates; (iii) ownership and transfers of registration of
such Certificates on the books of the Depository shall be governed by applicable
rules established by the Depository; (iv) the Depository may collect its usual
and customary fees, charges and expenses from its Depository Participants; (v)
the Trustee shall for all purposes deal with the Depository as representative of
the Certificate Owners of the Certificates for purposes of exercising the rights
of Holders under this Agreement, and requests and directions for and votes of
such representative shall not be deemed to be inconsistent if they are made with
respect to different Certificate Owners; (vi) the Trustee may rely and shall be
fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository with
respect to its Depository Participants and furnished by the Depository
Participants with respect to indirect participating firms and Persons shown on
the books of such indirect participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate
Owners; and (vii) the direct participants of the Depository shall have no rights
under this Agreement under or with respect to any of the Certificates held on
their behalf by the Depository, and the Depository may be treated by the Trustee
and its agents, employees, officers and directors as the absolute owner of the
Certificates for all purposes whatsoever.

            All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates shall
be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository
Participant or brokerage firm representing such Certificate Owners. Each
Depository Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of
Certificate Owners that it represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as
agent in accordance with the Depository's normal procedures. The parties hereto
are hereby authorized to execute a Letter of Representations with the Depository
or take such other action as may be necessary or desirable to register a
Book-Entry Certificate to the Depository. In the event of any conflict between
the terms of any such Letter of Representation and this Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall control.

            (c) If (i)(x) the Depository or the Depositor advises the Trustee in
writing that the Depository is no longer willing or able to discharge properly
its responsibilities as Depository and (y) the Trustee or the Depositor is
unable to locate a qualified successor, (ii) the Depositor, at its sole option,
with the consent of the Trustee, elects to terminate the book-entry system
through the Depository or (iii) after the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
Termination, the Certificate Owners of each Class of Book-Entry Certificates
representing Percentage Interests of such Classes aggregating not less than 51%
advises the Trustee and Depository through the Financial Intermediaries and the
Depository Participants in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system
through the Depository to the exclusion of definitive, fully registered
certificates (the "Definitive Certificates") to Certificate Owners is no longer
in the best interests of the Certificate Owners. Upon surrender to the
Certificate Registrar of the Book-Entry Certificates by the Depository,
accompanied by registration instructions from the Depository for registration,
the Trustee shall, at the Depositor's expense, in the case of (ii) above, or the
Trust's expense, in the case of (i) and (iii) above, execute on behalf of the
Trust and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate the Definitive
Certificates. None of the Depositor or the Trustee shall be liable for any delay
in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer, any
Paying Agent and the Depositor shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive
Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

            (d) Except with respect to a transfer of the Private Certificates
between or among the Depositor, the Seller, their affiliates or both, no
transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Private Certificate shall be
made unless such disposition is exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and any applicable state
securities laws or is made in accordance with the 1933 Act and laws. In the
event of any such transfer, (i) unless such transfer is made in reliance upon
Rule 144A (as evidenced by the investment letter delivered to the Certificate
Registrar, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit J) under the
1933 Act, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor shall require a written
Opinion of Counsel (which may be in-house counsel) acceptable to and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor
that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption, describing the
applicable exemption and the basis therefor, from the 1933 Act or is being made
pursuant to the 1933 Act, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of
the Certificate Registrar or the Depositor or (ii) the Certificate Registrar
shall require the transferor to execute a transferor certificate (in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit L) and the transferee to
execute an investment letter (in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit J) acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar certifying to the Depositor and the
Certificate Registrar the facts surrounding such transfer, which investment
letter shall not be an expense of the Certificate Registrar or the Depositor.
The Holder of a Private Certificate desiring to effect such transfer shall, and
does hereby agree to, indemnify the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor
against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not
made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

            No transfer of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate shall be made unless
the Certificate Registrar shall have received either (i) a representation from
the transferee of such Certificate, acceptable to and in form and substance
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor, (such requirement
is satisfied only by the Certificate Registrar's receipt of a representation
letter from the transferee substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto, as
appropriate), to the effect that such transferee is not an employee benefit plan
or arrangement subject to Section 406 of ERISA or a plan subject to Section 4975
of the Code, nor a person acting on behalf of any such plan or arrangement nor
using the assets of any such plan or arrangement to effect such transfer or (ii)
(except in the case of the Class R Certificate) in the case of any such ERISA
Restricted Certificate presented for registration in the name of an employee
benefit plan subject to ERISA or a plan or arrangement subject to Section 4975
of the Code (or comparable provisions of any subsequent enactments), or a
trustee of any such plan or any other person acting on behalf of any such plan
or arrangement or using such plan's or arrangement's assets, an Opinion of
Counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar, to the effect that the
purchase or holding of such ERISA Restricted Certificate will not result in the
assets of the Trust being deemed to be "plan assets" and subject to the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and will not subject the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar to any
obligation in addition to those expressly undertaken in this Agreement or to any
liability. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, such
representation shall be deemed to have been made to the Certificate Registrar by
the acceptance by a Certificate Owner of the beneficial interest in any such
Class of ERISA-Restricted Certificates, unless the Certificate Registrar shall
have received from the transferee an alternative representation acceptable in
form and substance to the Depositor. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary herein, any purported transfer of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate to or
on behalf of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or to the Code without
the delivery to the Certificate Registrar of an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory
to the Certificate Registrar as described above shall be void and of no effect.

            Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in the
Class R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such
Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to
have irrevocably appointed the Depositor or its designee as its attorney-in-fact
to negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale under clause (v) below and to
execute all instruments of transfer and to do all other things necessary in
connection with any such sale, and the rights of each Person acquiring any
Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the
following provisions:

            (i) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in the
      Class R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall promptly
      notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its
      status as a Permitted Transferee.

            (ii) No Person shall acquire an Ownership Interest in the Class R
      Certificate unless such Ownership Interest is a pro rata undivided
      interest.

            (iii) In connection with any proposed transfer of any Ownership
      Interest in the Class R Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall as a
      condition to registration of the transfer, require delivery to it, in form
      and substance satisfactory to it, of each of the following:

            A. an affidavit in the form of Exhibit K hereto from the proposed
transferee to the effect that, among other things, such transferee is a
Permitted Transferee and that it is not acquiring its Ownership Interest in the
Class R Certificate that is the subject of the proposed transfer as a nominee,
trustee or agent for any Person who is not a Permitted Transferee; and

            B. a covenant of the proposed transferee to the effect that the
proposed transferee agrees to be bound by and to abide by the transfer
restrictions applicable to the Class R Certificate.

            (iv) Any attempted or purported transfer of any Ownership Interest
      in the Class R Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section
      shall be absolutely null and void and shall vest no rights in the
      purported transferee. If any purported transferee shall, in violation of
      the provisions of this Section, become the Holder of the Class R
      Certificate, then the prior Holder of such Class R Certificate that is a
      Permitted Transferee shall, upon discovery that the registration of
      transfer of such Class R Certificate was not in fact permitted by this
      Section, be restored to all rights as Holder thereof retroactive to the
      date of registration of transfer of such Class R Certificate. The
      Certificate Registrar shall be under no liability to any Person for any
      registration of transfer of the Class R Certificate that is in fact not
      permitted by this Section or for making any distributions due on such
      Class R Certificate to the Holder thereof or taking any other action with
      respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement so long as
      the Certificate Registrar received the documents specified in clause
      (iii). The Trustee shall be entitled to recover from any Holder of the
      Class R Certificate that was in fact not a Permitted Transferee at the
      time such distributions were made all distributions made on such Class R
      Certificate. Any such distributions so recovered by the Trustee shall be
      distributed and delivered by the Trustee to the prior Holder of such Class
      R Certificate that is a Permitted Transferee.

            (v) If any Person other than a Disqualified Organization acquires
      any Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate in violation of the
      restrictions in this Section, then the Certificate Registrar shall have
      the right but not the obligation, without notice to the Holder of the
      Class R Certificate or any other Person having an Ownership Interest
      therein, to notify the Depositor to arrange for the sale of the Class R
      Certificate. The proceeds of such sale, net of commissions (which may
      include commissions payable to the Depositor or its affiliates in
      connection with such sale), expenses and taxes due, if any, will be
      remitted by the Trustee to the previous Holder of the Class R Certificate
      that is a Permitted Transferee, except that in the event that the Trustee
      determines that the Holder of the Class R Certificate may be liable for
      any amount due under this Section or any other provisions of this
      Agreement, the Trustee may withhold a corresponding amount from such
      remittance as security for such claim. The terms and conditions of any
      sale under this clause (v) shall be determined in the sole discretion of
      the Trustee and it shall not be liable to any Person having an Ownership
      Interest in the Class R Certificate as a result of its exercise of such
      discretion.

            (vi) If any Person other than a Permitted Transferee acquires any
      Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate in violation of the
      restrictions in this Section, then the Trustee will provide to the
      Internal Revenue Service, and to the persons specified in Sections
      860E(e)(3) and (6) of the Code, information needed to compute the tax
      imposed under Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code on transfers of residual
      interests to disqualified organizations. The Trustee shall be entitled to
      reasonable compensation for providing such information from the person to
      whom it is provided.

The foregoing provisions of this Section shall cease to apply to transfers
occurring on or after the date on which there shall have been delivered to the
Certificate Registrar, in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate
Registrar, (i) written notification from each Rating Agency that the removal of
the restrictions on Transfer set forth in this Section will not cause such
Rating Agency to downgrade its rating of the Certificates and (ii) an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such removal will not cause any REMIC hereunder to
fail to qualify as a REMIC.

            (e) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates of any Class, but the Certificate Registrar may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            All Certificates surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be cancelled by the Certificate Registrar and disposed of
pursuant to its standard procedures.

            Section 5.03 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

            If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate
Registrar or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate and (ii) there is delivered to
the Trustee, the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the
absence of notice to the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar that such
Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust, and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and Percentage Interest.
Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar) in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued
pursuant to this Section, shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of
ownership in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

            Section 5.04 Persons Deemed Owners.

            The Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar, any Paying Agent and any agent of the Master Servicer, the Depositor,
the Certificate Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Trustee may treat the Person,
including a Depository, in whose name any Certificate is registered as the owner
of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to
Section 4.01 and 4.02 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the
Master Servicer, the Trust, the Trustee nor any agent of any of them shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

            Section 5.05 Appointment of Paying Agent.

            The Paying Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from
the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 4.01 and 4.02 and shall report the
amounts of such distributions to the Trustee. The duties of the Paying Agent may
include the obligation to distribute statements and provide information to
Certificateholders as required hereunder. The Paying Agent hereunder shall at
all times be an entity duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of
the United States of America or any state thereof, authorized under such laws to
exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by
federal or state authorities. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Trustee.
The Trustee may appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent, which appointment
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Depositor and the Rating Agencies. The
Trustee as Paying Agent shall be subject to the same standards of care,
limitations on liability and rights to indemnity as the Trustee, and the
provisions of Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, 8.04, 8.05, 8.14, 8.15 and 8.16 shall
apply to the Paying Agent to the same extent as they apply to the Trustee. Any
Paying Agent appointed in accordance with this Section 5.05 may at any time
resign by giving at least 30 days' advance written notice of resignation to the
Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Depositor, such resignation to become
effective upon appointment of a successor Paying Agent.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         THE SERVICER AND THE DEPOSITOR

            Section 6.01 Liability of the Master Servicer and the Depositor.

            The Master Servicer shall be liable in accordance herewith only to
the extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the
Master Servicer herein. The Depositor shall be liable in accordance herewith
only to the extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken
by the Depositor.

            Section 6.02 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the
Obligations of, the Master Servicer or the Depositor.

            Any entity into which the Master Servicer or the Depositor may be
merged or consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Master Servicer or the Depositor shall be a party, or
any corporation succeeding to the business of the Master Servicer or the
Depositor, shall be the successor of the Master Servicer or the Depositor, as
the case may be, hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that the successor servicer shall
satisfy all the requirements of Section 7.02 with respect to the qualifications
of a successor servicer.

            Section 6.03 Limitation on Liability of the Master Servicer and
Others.

            Neither the Master Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or
employees or agents of the Master Servicer shall be under any liability to the
Trust or the Certificateholders for any action taken or for refraining from the
taking of any action by the Master Servicer in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement, or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Master Servicer or any such Person against any liability
which would otherwise be imposed by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith
or negligence in the performance of duties of the Master Servicer or by reason
of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties of the Master Servicer
hereunder; provided, further, that this provision shall not be construed to
entitle the Master Servicer to indemnity in the event that amounts advanced by
the Master Servicer to retire any senior lien exceed Liquidation Proceeds (in
excess of related liquidation expenses) realized with respect to the related
Mortgage Loan. The Master Servicer and any director or officer or employee or
agent of the Master Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any kind
prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising hereunder. The Master Servicer and any director or officer or employee
or agent of the Master Servicer shall be indemnified by the Trust and held
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any
legal action relating to this Agreement or the Certificates, other than any
loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of its
reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. The Master Servicer may
undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of
this Agreement, and the rights and duties of the parties hereto and the
interests of the Certificateholders hereunder. In such event, the reasonable
legal expenses and costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom
shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust and the Master Servicer
shall be entitled to pay such expenses from the proceeds of the Trust or to be
reimbursed therefor pursuant to Section 3.05 upon presentation to the Trustee of
documentation of such expenses, costs and liabilities. The Master Servicer's
right to indemnity or reimbursement pursuant to this Section shall survive any
resignation or termination of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04 or
7.01 with respect to any losses, expenses, costs or liabilities arising prior to
such resignation or termination (or arising from events that occurred prior to
such resignation or termination). This paragraph shall apply to the Master
Servicer solely in its capacity as Master Servicer hereunder and in no other
capacities.

            Section 6.04 Master Servicer Not to Resign.

            Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 6.02, the
Master Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed
on it except (i) upon determination that the performance of its obligations or
duties hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or are in
material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried
on by it or its subsidiaries or Affiliates, the other activities of the Master
Servicer so causing such a conflict being of a type and nature carried on by the
Master Servicer or its subsidiaries or Affiliates at the date of this Agreement
or (ii) upon satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) the Master Servicer
has proposed a successor servicer to the Trustee in writing and such proposed
successor servicer is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee; and (b) each Rating
Agency shall have delivered a letter to the Trustee prior to the appointment of
the successor servicer stating that the proposed appointment of such successor
servicer as Master Servicer hereunder will not result in the reduction or
withdrawal of the then current rating of the Regular Certificates or the ratings
that are in effect; provided, however, that no such resignation by the Master
Servicer shall become effective until such successor servicer or, in the case of
(i) above, the Trustee shall have assumed the Master Servicer's responsibilities
and obligations hereunder or the Trustee shall have designated a successor
servicer in accordance with Section 7.02. Any such resignation shall not relieve
the Master Servicer of responsibility for any of the obligations specified in
Sections 7.01 and 7.02 as obligations that survive the resignation or
termination of the Master Servicer. Any such determination permitting the
resignation of the Master Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel
to such effect delivered to the Trustee.

            Section 6.05 Delegation of Duties.

            (a) In the ordinary course of business, the Master Servicer at any
time may delegate any of its duties hereunder to any Person, including any of
its Affiliates, who agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with standards
comparable to those set forth in Section 3.01. Such delegation shall not relieve
the Master Servicer of its liabilities and responsibilities with respect to such
duties and shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section
6.04. The Master Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Rating Agencies with
60 days prior written notice prior to the delegation of any of its duties to any
Person other than any of the Master Servicer's Affiliates or their respective
successors and assigns.

            (b) The Master Servicer is hereby authorized to enter into a
financing or other facility (any such arrangement, an "Advance Facility") under
which (1) the Master Servicer assigns or pledges to another Person (together
with such Person's successors and assigns, an "Advancing Person") the Master
Servicer's rights under this Agreement to be reimbursed for any Advances or
Servicing Advances and/or (2) an Advancing Person agrees to fund some or all
Advances and/or Servicing Advances required to be made by the Master Servicer
pursuant to this Agreement. No consent of the Depositor, the Trustee, the
Certificateholders or any other party shall be required before the Master
Servicer may enter into an Advance Facility. The Master Servicer shall notify
each other party to this Agreement prior to or promptly after entering into or
terminating any Advance Facility. Notwithstanding the existence of any Advance
Facility under which an Advancing Person agrees to fund Advances and/or
Servicing Advances on the Master Servicer's behalf, the Master Servicer shall
remain obligated pursuant to this Agreement to make Advances and Servicing
Advances pursuant to and as required by this Agreement. If the Master Servicer
enters into an Advance Facility, and for so long as an Advancing Person remains
entitled to receive reimbursement for any Advances and/or Servicing Advances, as
applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, then the Master Servicer shall not be
permitted to reimburse itself for Advances and/or Servicing Advances, but
instead the Master Servicer shall be required to remit amounts collected that
would otherwise be retained by the Master Servicer to reimburse it for the
amount of previously unreimbursed Advances ("Advance Reimbursements") and/or
previously unreimbursed Servicing Advances ("Servicing Advance Reimbursements"
and together with Advance Reimbursements, "Reimbursements") (in each case to the
extent such type of Reimbursements are included in the Advance Facility) in
accordance with the documentation establishing the Advance Facility to such
Advancing Person or to a trustee, agent or custodian (an "Advance Facility
Trustee") designated by such Advancing Person. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in no event shall Advance Reimbursements or Servicing Advance
Reimbursements be included in the "Available Funds" or distributed to
Certificateholders.

            Reimbursements shall consist solely of amounts in respect of
Advances and/or Servicing Advances made with respect to the Mortgage Loans for
which the Master Servicer would be permitted to reimburse itself in accordance
with this Agreement, assuming the Master Servicer had made the related
Advance(s) and/or Servicing Advance(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person
shall be entitled to reimbursement from funds held in the Collection Account for
future distribution to Certificateholders pursuant to this Agreement. None of
the Depositor or the Trustee shall have any duty or liability with respect to
the calculation or payment of any Reimbursements, nor shall the Depositor or the
Trustee have any responsibility to track or monitor the administration of the
Advance Facility or the payment of Reimbursements to the related Advancing
Person or Advance Facility Trustee. The Master Servicer shall maintain and
provide to any successor servicer and (upon request) the Trustee a detailed
accounting on a loan by loan basis as to amounts advanced by, pledged or
assigned to, and reimbursed to any Advancing Person. The successor servicer
shall be entitled to rely on any such information provided by the predecessor
servicer, and the successor servicer shall not be liable for any errors in such
information.

            An Advancing Person who receives an assignment or pledge of the
rights to be reimbursed for Advances and/or Servicing Advances, and/or whose
obligations hereunder are limited to the funding of Advances and/or Servicing
Advances shall not be required to meet the criteria for qualification of a
subservicer set forth in this Agreement.

            The documentation establishing any Advance Facility shall require
that Reimbursements distributed with respect to each Mortgage Loan be allocated
to outstanding unreimbursed Advances or Servicing Advances (as the case may be)
made with respect to that Mortgage Loan on a "first in, first out" (FIFO) basis.
Such documentation shall also require the Master Servicer to provide to the
related Advancing Person or Advance Facility Trustee loan by loan information
with respect to each Reimbursement distributed to such Advancing Person or
Advance Facility Trustee on each Distribution Date, to enable the Advancing
Person or Advance Facility Trustee to make the FIFO allocation of each
Reimbursement with respect to each Mortgage Loan. The Master Servicer shall
remain entitled to be reimbursed by the Advancing Person or Advance Facility
Trustee for all Advances and Servicing Advances funded by the Master Servicer to
the extent the related rights to be reimbursed therefor have not been assigned
or pledged to an Advancing Person.

            The Master Servicer shall indemnify the Depositor, the Trustee, any
successor servicer and the Trust Fund resulting from any claim by the related
Advancing Person, except to the extent that such claim, loss, liability or
damage resulted from or arose out of negligence, recklessness or willful
misconduct on the part of the Depositor, the Trustee or any successor servicer.

            Any amendment to this Section 6.05(b) or to any other provision of
this Agreement that may be necessary or appropriate to effect the terms of an
Advance Facility as described generally in this Section 6.05(b), including
amendments to add provisions relating to a successor servicer, may be entered
into by the Trustee, the Depositor and the Master Servicer without the consent
of any Certificateholder, provided such amendment complies with Section 11.01
hereof. All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of each
party hereto of any such amendment shall be borne solely by the Master Servicer.
Prior to entering into an Advance Facility, the Master Servicer shall notify the
lender under such facility in writing that: (a) the Advances and/or Servicing
Advances financed by and/or pledged to the lender are obligations owed to the
Master Servicer on a non-recourse basis payable only from the cash flows and
proceeds received under this Agreement for reimbursement of Advances and/or
Servicing Advances only to the extent provided herein, and the Trustee and the
Trust are not otherwise obligated or liable to repay any Advances and/or
Servicing Advances financed by the lender; (b) the Master Servicer will be
responsible for remitting to the lender the applicable amounts collected by it
as reimbursement for Advances and/or Servicing Advances funded by the lender,
subject to the restrictions and priorities created in this Agreement; and (c)
the Trustee shall not have any responsibility to track or monitor the
administration of the financing arrangement between the Master Servicer and the
lender.

            Section 7.01 Servicer Events of Termination.

            (a) If any one of the following events ("Servicer Events of
Termination") shall occur and be continuing:

            (i) (A) The failure by the Master Servicer to make any Advance; or
      (B) any other failure by the Master Servicer to deposit in the Collection
      Account or Distribution Account any deposit required to be made under the
      terms of this Agreement, which failure continues unremedied for a period
      of one Business Day; or

            (ii) The failure by the Master Servicer to make any required
      Servicing Advance which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30
      days, or the failure by the Master Servicer duly to observe or perform, in
      any material respect, any other covenants, obligations or agreements of
      the Master Servicer as set forth in this Agreement, which failure
      continues unremedied for a period of 30 days, after the date (A) on which
      written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall
      have been given to the Master Servicer by the Trustee or by any Holder of
      a Regular Certificate evidencing at least 25% of the Voting Rights or (B)
      actual knowledge of such failure by a Servicing Officer of the Master
      Servicer; or

            (iii) The entry against the Master Servicer of a decree or order by
      a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the
      premises for the appointment of a trustee, conservator, receiver or
      liquidator in any insolvency, conservatorship, receivership, readjustment
      of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or
      for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of
      any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 days;
      or

            (iv) The Master Servicer shall voluntarily go into liquidation,

      debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for
      the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered
      against the Master Servicer and such decree or order shall have remained
      in force undischarged, unbonded or unstayed for a period of 60 days; or
      the Master Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts
      generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any
      applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for
      the benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of its
      obligations; or

      Collection Period and the two preceding Collection Periods of the
      fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is (a) the
      aggregate Principal Balance of 60+ Day Delinquent Loans and the
      denominator of which is (b) the aggregate Principal Balance of the
      Mortgage Loans, in the case of both (a) and (b), as of the last day of
      each such Collection Period, exceeds 18%.

            (b) Then, and in each and every such case, so long as a Servicer
Event of Termination shall not have been remedied within the applicable grace
period, (x) with respect solely to clause (i)(A) above, if such Advance is not
made by 2:00 P.M., New York time, on the Business Day immediately following the
Servicer Remittance Date, the Trustee may terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement and the Trustee, or a
successor servicer appointed in accordance with Section 7.02, shall immediately
make such Advance and assume, pursuant to Section 7.02, the duties of a
successor servicer and (y) in the case of (i)(B), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v)
above, the Trustee shall, at the direction of the Holders of each Class of
Regular Certificates evidencing Percentage Interests aggregating not less than
51%, by notice then given in writing to the Master Servicer (and to the Trustee
if given by Holders of Certificates), terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer as servicer under this Agreement. Any such
notice to the Master Servicer shall also be given to each Rating Agency and the
Depositor. On or after the receipt by the Master Servicer (and by the Trustee if
such notice is given by the Holders) of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Master Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Certificates or the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in
the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section or successor servicer appointed
in connection with Section 7.02; and, without limitation, the Trustee or
successor servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the Master Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all
documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of each Mortgage
Loan and Related Documents or otherwise. The Master Servicer agrees to cooperate
with the Trustee (or the applicable successor servicer) in effecting the
termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Master Servicer hereunder,
including, without limitation, the delivery to the Trustee (or the applicable
successor servicer) of all documents and records requested by it to enable it to
assume the Master Servicer's functions under this Agreement within ten Business
Days subsequent to such notice, the transfer within one Business Day subsequent
to such notice to the Trustee (or the applicable successor servicer) for the
administration by it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the
Master Servicer and to be deposited by it in the Collection Account, the
Distribution Account or any Escrow Account or that have been deposited by the
Master Servicer in such accounts or thereafter received by the Master Servicer
with respect to the Mortgage Loans or any REO Property received by the Master
Servicer. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred in connection with transferring the servicing to the successor
servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect such succession as Master
Servicer pursuant to this Section shall be paid by the predecessor servicer (or
if the predecessor servicer is the Trustee, the initial servicer) upon
presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses, and if such
predecessor Servicer defaults in its obligation to pay such costs, such costs
shall be paid by the successor Servicer or the Trustee (in which case the
successor Servicer or the Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement therefor
from the assets of the Trust).

            Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of a Master
Servicer hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive payment of
all accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees and reimbursement for all outstanding
Advances and Servicing Advances properly made prior to the date of termination.

            Section 7.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

            (a) Within 90 days of the time the Master Servicer (and the Trustee,
if notice is sent by the Holders) receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.01 or 6.04, the Trustee (or such other successor servicer as is
approved in accordance with this Agreement) shall be the successor in all
respects to the Master Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement
and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to
all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the
Master Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof arising on and after its
succession. As compensation therefor, the Trustee (or such other successor
servicer) shall be entitled to such compensation as the Master Servicer would
have been entitled to hereunder if no such notice of termination had been given.
Notwithstanding the above, (i) if the Trustee is unwilling to act as successor
servicer or (ii) if the Trustee is legally unable so to act, the Trustee shall
appoint or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any
established housing and home finance institution, bank or other mortgage loan or
home equity loan servicer having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 as the
successor to the Master Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part
of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer hereunder;
provided, that the appointment of any such successor servicer will not result in
the qualification, reduction or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to the
Certificates or the ratings that are in effect by the Rating Agencies as
evidenced by a letter to such effect from the Rating Agencies. Pending
appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder, unless the Trustee
is prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove provided. In connection with such appointment and assumption, the
successor shall be entitled to receive compensation out of payments on Mortgage
Loans in an amount equal to the compensation which the Master Servicer would
otherwise have received pursuant to Section 3.18 (or such other compensation as
the Trustee and such successor shall agree, not to exceed the Servicing Fee).
The successor servicer shall be entitled to withdraw from the Collection Account
all costs and expenses associated with the transfer of the servicing to the
successor servicer, including costs and expenses of the Trustee. The appointment
of a successor servicer shall not affect any liability of the predecessor
servicer which may have arisen under this Agreement prior to its termination as
Master Servicer to pay any deductible under an insurance policy pursuant to
Section 3.12 or to indemnify the parties indicated in Section 3.26 pursuant to
the terms thereof, nor shall any successor servicer be liable for any acts or
omissions of the predecessor servicer or for any breach by such servicer of any
of its representations or warranties contained herein or in any related document
or agreement. The Trustee and such successor shall take such action, consistent
with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

            (b) Any successor, including the Trustee, to the Master Servicer as
servicer shall during the term of its service as servicer continue to service
and administer the Mortgage Loans for the benefit of Certificateholders, and
maintain in force a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and
omissions in the performance of its obligations as Master Servicer hereunder and
a Fidelity Bond in respect of its officers, employees and agents to the same
extent as the Master Servicer is so required pursuant to Section 3.12.

            Section 7.03 Waiver of Defaults.

            The Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 66 2/3% of the
Voting Rights allocated to the Classes of Certificates affected by a Servicer
Event of Termination may, on behalf of all Certificateholders, waive any events
permitting removal of the Master Servicer as servicer pursuant to this Article
VII, provided, however, that such Holders may not waive a default in making a
required distribution on a Certificate without the consent of the Holder of such
Certificate. Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to
exist and any Servicer Event of Termination arising therefrom shall be deemed to
have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereto
except to the extent expressly so waived. Notice of any such waiver shall be
given by the Trustee to the Rating Agencies.

            Section 7.04 Notification to Certificateholders.

            (a) On any termination or appointment of a successor to the Master
Servicer pursuant to this Article VII or Section 6.04, the Trustee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Certificateholders at their respective
addresses appearing in the Certificate Register and each Rating Agency.

            (b) No later than 60 days after the occurrence of any event which
constitutes or which, with notice or a lapse of time or both, would constitute a
Servicer Event of Termination for five Business Days after a Responsible Officer
of the Trustee becomes aware of the occurrence of such an event, the Trustee
shall transmit by mail to all Certificateholders notice of such occurrence
unless such default or Servicer Event of Termination shall have been waived or
cured. Such notice shall be given to the Rating Agencies promptly after any such
occurrence.

            Section 7.05 Survivability of Master Servicer Liabilities.

            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon termination of
the Master Servicer hereunder, any liabilities of the Master Servicer which
accrued prior to such termination shall survive such termination.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   THE TRUSTEE

            Section 8.01 Duties of Trustee.

            The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
Termination of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual
knowledge and after the curing of all Servicer Events of Termination which may
have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement. If a Servicer Event of Termination has
occurred (which has not been cured) of which a Responsible Officer has actual
knowledge, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,
as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct
of such person's own affairs.

            The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform to the requirements of this Agreement; provided, however, that that the
Trustee shall not be responsible for the accuracy or content of any resolution,
certificate, statement, opinion, report, document, order or other instrument
furnished by the Master Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor hereunder. If any
such instrument is found not to conform in any material respect to the
requirements of this Agreement, the Trustee shall notify the Certificateholders
of such instrument in the event that the Trustee, after so requesting, does not
receive a satisfactorily corrected instrument.

            No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

            (i) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination of
      which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge,
      and after the curing of all such Servicer Events of Termination which may
      have occurred, the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be
      determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee
      shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and
      obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no implied
      covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
      Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the
      Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
      correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or
      opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of
      this Agreement;

            (ii) the Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error of
      judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee,
      unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining
      or investigating the facts related thereto;

            (iii) the Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any
      action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
      accordance with the direction of the Majority Certificateholders relating
      to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
      available to the Trustee or exercising or omitting to exercise any trust
      or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Agreement; and

            (iv) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any failure
      by the Master Servicer to comply with the obligations of the Master
      Servicer referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01(a) or any
      Servicer Event of Termination unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
      at the Corporate Trust Office obtains actual knowledge of such failure or
      the Trustee receives written notice of such failure from the Master
      Servicer or the Majority Certificateholders. In the absence of such
      receipt of such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume that there is
      no Servicer Event of Termination.

            The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there is
reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it, and
none of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event require
the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance of, any
of the obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement, except during
such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and be vested with
the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Master Servicer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

            The Trustee shall not have any duty (A) to see any recording,
filing, or depositing of this Agreement or any agreement referred to herein or
any financing statement or continuation statement evidencing a security
interest, or to see to the maintenance of any such recording or filing or
depositing or to any rerecording, refiling or redepositing of any thereof, (B)
to see to any insurance or (C) to see to the payment or discharge of any tax,
assessment, or other governmental charge or any lien or encumbrance of any kind
owing with respect to, assessed or levied against, any part of the Trust Fund
other than from funds available in the Distribution Account.

            Section 8.02 Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

            (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

            (i) the Trustee may request and rely upon, and shall be protected in
      acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, Officer's
      Certificate, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement,
      instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal,
      bond or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine
      and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

            (ii) the Trustee may consult with counsel and any advice or Opinion
      of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in
      respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good
      faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

            (iii) the Trustee shall not be under any obligation to exercise any
      of the rights or powers vested in it by this Agreement, or to institute,
      conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation hereto, at the
      request, order or direction of the Certificateholders pursuant to the
      provisions of this Agreement, unless such Certificateholders shall have
      offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs,
      expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; the
      right of the Trustee to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this
      Agreement shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee shall not be
      answerable for other than its negligence or willful misconduct in the
      performance of any such act;

            (iv) the Trustee shall not be personally liable for any action
      taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be
      authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it
      by this Agreement;

            (v) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination and
      after the curing of all Servicer Events of Termination which may have
      occurred, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
      the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
      instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval,
      bond or other paper or documents, unless requested in writing to do so by
      the Majority Certificateholders; provided, however, that if the payment
      within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or
      liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such
      investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to
      the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement,
      the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or
      liability as a condition to such proceeding. The reasonable expense of
      every such examination shall be paid by the Master Servicer or, if paid by
      the Trustee, shall be reimbursed by the Master Servicer upon demand.
      Nothing in this clause (v) shall derogate from the obligation of the
      Master Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of
      information regarding the Mortgagors;

            (vi) the Trustee shall not be accountable, have any liability or
      make any representation as to any acts or omissions hereunder of the
      Master Servicer until such time as the Trustee may be required to act as
      Master Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02;

            (vii) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder
      or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
      attorneys or a custodian and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any
      misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent, attorney or
      custodian appointed by it with due care; and

            (viii) the right of the Trustee to perform any discretionary act
      enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty, and the
      Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its negligence or willful
      misconduct in the performance of such act.

            Section 8.03 Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Mortgage Loans.

            The recitals contained herein and in the Certificates (other than
the authentication of the Trustee on the Certificates) shall be taken as the
statements of the Depositor, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the
correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity
or sufficiency of this Agreement or of the Certificates (other than the
signature and authentication of the Trustee on the Certificates) or of any
Mortgage Loan or Related Document. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the
use or application by the Master Servicer, or for the use or application of any
funds paid to the Master Servicer in respect of the Mortgage Loans or deposited
in or withdrawn from the Collection Account by the Master Servicer. The Trustee
shall not at any time have any responsibility or liability for or with respect
to the legality, validity and enforceability of any Mortgage or any Mortgage
Loan, or the perfection and priority of any Mortgage or the maintenance of any
such perfection and priority, or for or with respect to the sufficiency of the
Trust or its ability to generate the payments to be distributed to
Certificateholders under this Agreement, including, without limitation: the
existence, condition and ownership of any Mortgaged Property; the existence and
enforceability of any hazard insurance thereon (other than if the Trustee shall
assume the duties of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); the validity
of the assignment of any Mortgage Loan to the Trustee or of any intervening
assignment; the completeness of any Mortgage Loan; the performance or
enforcement of any Mortgage Loan (other than if the Trustee shall assume the
duties of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); the compliance by the
Depositor or the Master Servicer with any warranty or representation made under
this Agreement or in any related document or the accuracy of any such warranty
or representation prior to the Trustee's receipt of notice or other discovery of
any non-compliance therewith or any breach thereof; any investment of monies by
or at the direction of the Master Servicer or any loss resulting therefrom, it
being understood that the Trustee shall remain responsible for any Trust
property that it may hold in its individual capacity; the acts or omissions of
any of the Master Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of
the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02), or any Mortgagor; any action of
the Master Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the
Master Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02), taken in the name of the Trustee; the
failure of the Master Servicer to act or perform any duties required of it as
agent of the Trustee hereunder; or any action by the Trustee taken at the
instruction of the Master Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the
duties of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not relieve the Trustee of its obligation to perform its
duties under this Agreement. The Trustee shall not have any responsibility for
filing any financing or continuation statement in any public office at any time
or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or
lien granted to it hereunder.

            Section 8.04 Trustee May Own Certificates.

            The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the
owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights as it would have if it
were not Trustee and may transact any banking and trust business with the Master
Servicer, the Depositor or their Affiliates.

            Section 8.05 Trustee Fees and Expenses.

            The Trustee shall be entitled to the Trustee Fee (which shall not be
limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an
express trust) for all services rendered by the Trustee in the exercise and
performance of any of the powers and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall
withdraw from the Distribution Account on each Distribution Date and pay to
itself the Trustee Fee. The Trust shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the
reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of
all persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement
or advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith or which is the
responsibility of Certificateholders or the Trustee hereunder. In addition, the
Trustee and its officers, directors, employees and agents shall be indemnified
by the Trust from, and held harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims or expenses incurred in connection with any legal action
relating to this Agreement or the Certificates, other than any loss, liability
or expense incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of
the Trustee in the performance of its duties hereunder or by reason of the
Trustee's reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. This Section
shall survive termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of any
Trustee hereunder.

            Section 8.06 Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

            The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be an entity duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and a minimum long-term
debt rating of BBB by Fitch and S&P and a long term debt rating of at least A1
or better by Moody's and subject to supervision or examination by federal or
state authority. If such entity publishes reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 8.06, the combined
capital and surplus of such entity shall be deemed to be its combined capital
and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
The principal office of the Trustee (other than the initial Trustee) shall be in
a state with respect to which an Opinion of Counsel has been delivered to such
Trustee at the time such Trustee is appointed Trustee to the effect that the
Trust will not be a taxable entity under the laws of such state. In case at any
time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 8.06, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with
the effect specified in Section 8.07.

            Section 8.07 Resignation or Removal of Trustee.

            The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts
hereby created by giving written notice thereof to the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and each Rating Agency. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the
Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning
Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall
have been so appointed and having accepted appointment within 30 days after the
giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

            If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8.06 and shall fail to resign after written
request therefor by the Depositor, or if at any time the Trustee shall be
legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a
receiver of the Trustee or of their property shall be appointed, or any public
officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of their property or
affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the
Depositor may remove the Trustee. If the Depositor removes the Trustee under the
authority of the immediately preceding sentence, the Depositor shall promptly
appoint a successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of
which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to
the successor Trustee.

            The Majority Certificateholders may at any time remove the Trustee
by written instrument or instruments delivered to the Master Servicer, the
Depositor and the Trustee; the Depositor shall thereupon use its best efforts to
appoint a successor Trustee in accordance with this Section.

            Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 8.07 shall
not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as
provided in Section 8.08.

            Section 8.08 Successor Trustee.

            Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.07 shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor, the Rating Agencies, the
Master Servicer and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor Trustee shall become effective, and such successor Trustee, without
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like
effect as if originally named as Trustee. The Depositor, the Master Servicer and
the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such
other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and
confirming in the successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations.

            No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section 8.08 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall
be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 and the appointment of such
successor Trustee shall not result in a downgrading of the Regular Certificates
by either Rating Agency, as evidenced by a letter from each Rating Agency.

            Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in
this Section 8.08, the successor Trustee shall mail notice of the appointment of
a successor Trustee hereunder to all Holders of Certificates at their addresses
as shown in the Certificate Register and to each Rating Agency.

            Section 8.09 Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.

            Any entity into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any entity
succeeding to the business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the
hereunder, provided such entity shall be eligible under the provisions of
Section 8.06 and 8.08, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding.

            Section 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time,
for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which
any part of the Trust or any Mortgaged Property may at the time be located, the
Depositor and the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute
and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the
Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the Trustee, or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust, and to
vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, and, subject
to the other provisions of this Section 8.10, such powers, duties, obligations,
rights and trusts as the Master Servicer and the Trustee may consider necessary
or desirable. Any such co-trustee or separate trustee shall be subject to the
written approval of the Master Servicer. If the Master Servicer shall not have
joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request
so to do, or in the case a Servicer Event of Termination shall have occurred and
be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.
No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms
of eligibility as a successor Trustee under Section 8.06, and no notice to
Certificateholders of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall be required under Section 8.08.

            Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:

            (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
      upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
      performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly
      (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not
      authorized to act separately without the Trustee joining in such act),
      except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any
      particular act or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder
      or as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be
      incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event
      such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of
      title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall
      be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee,
      but solely at the direction of the Trustee;

            (ii) no trustee hereunder shall be held personally liable by reason
      of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

            (iii) the Master Servicer and the Trustee, acting jointly may at any
      time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or
      co-trustee except that following the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
      Termination, the Trustee acting alone may accept the resignation or remove
      any separate trustee or co-trustee.

            Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees,
as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance
of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified
in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately,
as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and a copy thereof given to the
Depositor, the Rating Agencies and the Master Servicer.

            Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time, constitute the
Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor Trustee.

            Section 8.11 Limitation of Liability.

            The Certificates are executed by the Trustee, not in its individual
capacity but solely as Trustee of the Trust, in the exercise of the powers and
authority conferred and vested in it by this Agreement. Each of the undertakings
and agreements made on the part of the Trustee in the Certificates is made and
intended not as a personal undertaking or agreement by the Trustee but is made
and intended for the purpose of binding only the Trust.

            Section 8.12 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of
Certificates.

            (a) All rights of action and claims under this Agreement or the
Certificates may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Certificates or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall
be brought in its own name or in its capacity as Trustee for the benefit of all
Holders of such Certificates, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Any
recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursement and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Certificateholders in respect of
which such judgment has been recovered.

            (b) The Trustee shall afford the Depositor, the Master Servicer and
each Certificateholder upon reasonable notice during normal business hours,
access to all records maintained by the Trustee in respect of its duties
hereunder and access to officers of the Trustee responsible for performing such
duties. The Trustee shall cooperate fully with the Master Servicer, the
Depositor and such Certificateholder and shall make available to the Master
Servicer, the Depositor and such Certificateholder for review and copying at the
expense of the party requesting such copies, such books, documents or records as
may be requested with respect to the Trustee's duties hereunder. The Depositor,
the Master Servicer and the Certificateholders shall not have any responsibility
or liability for any action or failure to act by the Trustee and are not
obligated to supervise the performance of the Trustee under this Agreement or
otherwise.

            Section 8.13 Suits for Enforcement.

            In case a Servicer Event of Termination or other default by the
Master Servicer hereunder shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee may proceed
to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Certificateholders under
this Agreement by a suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law or otherwise,
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or in aid of the execution of any power granted in this Agreement
or for the enforcement of any other legal, equitable or other remedy, as the
Trustee, being advised by counsel, and subject to the foregoing, shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any of the rights of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders.

            Section 8.14 Waiver of Bond Requirement.

            The Trustee shall be relieved of, and each Certificateholder hereby
waives, any requirement of any jurisdiction in which the Trust, or any part
thereof, may be located that the Trustee post a bond or other surety with any
court, agency or body whatsoever.

            Section 8.15 Waiver of Inventory, Accounting and Appraisal
Requirement.

            The Trustee shall be relieved of, and each Certificateholder hereby
waives, any requirement of any jurisdiction in which the Trust, or any part
thereof, may be located that the Trustee file any inventory, accounting or
appraisal of the Trust with any court, agency or body at any time or in any
manner whatsoever.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                     REMIC AND GRANTOR TRUST ADMINISTRATION

            Section 9.01 REMIC Administration.

            (a) The Trustee shall make or cause to be made REMIC elections for
each of REMIC 1, REMIC 2, REMIC 3 and REMIC 4 as set forth in the Preliminary
Statement on Forms 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or information return
for the taxable year ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the
Certificates are issued. The regular interests and residual interest in each
REMIC shall be as designated in the Preliminary Statement.

            (b) The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day" of
each REMIC within the meaning of section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.

            (c) The Trustee shall pay any and all tax related expenses (not
including taxes) of each REMIC, including but not limited to any professional
fees or expenses related to audits or any administrative or judicial proceedings
with respect to such REMIC that involve the Internal Revenue Service or state
tax authorities, but only to the extent that (i) such expenses are ordinary or
routine expenses, including expenses of a routine audit but not expenses of
litigation (except as described in (ii)); or (ii) such expenses or liabilities
(including taxes and penalties) are attributable to the negligence or willful
misconduct of the Trustee in fulfilling its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall
be entitled to reimbursement of expenses to the extent provided in clause (i)
above from the Trust.

            (d) The Trustee shall prepare or cause to be prepared, sign and file
or cause to be filed, each REMIC's federal and state tax and information returns
as such REMIC's direct representative. The expenses of preparing and filing such
returns shall be borne by the Trustee.

            (e) The Holder of the Class R Certificate shall be the "tax matters
person" as defined in the REMIC Provisions (the "Tax Matters Person") with
respect to a REMIC, and the Trustee is irrevocably designated as and shall act
as attorney-in-fact and agent for such Tax Matters Person for each REMIC. The
Trustee, as agent for the Tax Matters Person, shall perform, on behalf of each
REMIC, all reporting and other tax compliance duties that are the responsibility
of such REMIC under the Code, the REMIC Provisions, or other compliance guidance
issued by the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority.
Among its other duties, if required by the Code, the REMIC Provisions, or other
such guidance, the Trustee, as agent for the Tax Matters Person, shall provide
(i) to the Treasury or other governmental authority such information as is
necessary for the application of any tax relating to the transfer of the Class R
Certificate to any disqualified person or organization and (ii) to the
Certificateholders such information or reports as are required by the Code or
REMIC Provisions.

            (f) The Trustee, the Master Servicer, and the Holders of
Certificates shall take any action or cause any REMIC formed under this
Agreement to take any action necessary to create or maintain the status of such
REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions and shall assist each other as
necessary to create or maintain such status. None of the Trustee, the Master
Servicer or the Holder of the Class R Certificate shall take any action or cause
any REMIC formed under this Agreement to take any action or fail to take (or
fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC Provisions, if taken
or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the status of such REMIC as
a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon such REMIC (including but
not limited to the tax on prohibited transactions as defined in Code Section
860F(a)(2) and the tax on prohibited contributions set forth on Section 860G(d)
of the Code) (either such event, an "Adverse REMIC Event") unless the Trustee
and the Master Servicer have received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of
the party seeking to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated
action will not endanger such status or result in the imposition of such a tax.
In addition, prior to taking any action with respect to any REMIC formed under
this Agreement or the assets therein, or causing such REMIC to take any action,
which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement, any Holder
of the Class R Certificate will consult with the Trustee and the Master
Servicer, or their respective designees, in writing, with respect to whether
such action could cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect to such
REMIC, and no such Person shall take any such action or cause such REMIC to take
any such action as to which the Trustee or the Master Servicer has advised it in
writing that an Adverse REMIC Event could occur.

            (g) The Holder of the Class R Certificate shall pay when due any and
all taxes imposed on any REMIC formed under this Agreement by federal or state
governmental authorities, but only from amounts, if any, distributable thereon.
To the extent that such REMIC taxes are not paid by the Class R
Certificateholder, the Trustee shall pay any remaining REMIC taxes out of future
amounts otherwise distributable to the Holder of the Class R Certificate or, if
no such amounts are available, out of other amounts held in the Distribution
Account, and shall reduce amounts otherwise payable to Holders of the REMIC
Regular Interests or the Certificates, as the case may be.

            (h) The Trustee, shall, for federal income tax purposes, maintain or
cause to be maintained books and records with respect to each REMIC formed under
this Agreement on a calendar year and on an accrual basis.

            (i) No additional contributions of assets shall be made to any
REMIC, except as expressly provided in this Agreement with respect to Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans.

            (j) Neither the Trustee nor the Master Servicer shall enter into any
arrangement by which any REMIC will receive a fee or other compensation for
services.

            (k) On or before April 15 of each calendar year beginning in 2004,
the Trustee shall deliver to each Rating Agency an Officer's Certificate stating
the Trustee's compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.01.

            (l) The Trustee shall treat (i) the rights of the Offered
Certificates to receive Cap Carryover Amounts as a right in interest rate cap
contracts written by the Class CE Certificateholders in favor of the Holders of
the Offered Certificates and (ii) the rights of the Class CE Certificates under
the Yield Maintenance Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof and shall
assign such rights for federal tax return and information reporting a value of
zero. The Trustee shall account for such as property held separate and apart
from the regular interests it holds in each of the REMICs created hereunder. The
provisions of this paragraph are intended to satisfy the requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(i) for the treatment of property rights
coupled with regular interests to be separately respected and shall be
interpreted consistent with such regulation. On each Distribution Date, to the
extent the Offered Certificates receive interest in excess of the Class A-1
REMIC Pass-Through Rate, Class A-1A REMIC Pass-Through Rate, Class A-2 REMIC
Pass-Through Rate, Class A-3 REMIC Pass-Through Rate, Class M-1 REMIC
Pass-Through Rate, Class M-2 REMIC Pass-Through Rate, Class M-3 REMIC
Pass-Through Rate, Class M-4 REMIC Pass-Through Rate, Class M-5 REMIC
Pass-Through Rate and Class M-6 REMIC Pass-Through Rate, as applicable, such
interest will be treated as distributed on the REMIC 4 Components, pro rata,
beneficially owned by the Class CE Certificates, together with any amount
deposited in the Reserve Account in respect of the Yield Maintenance Agreement,
and then paid to the respective Classes of Offered Certificates pursuant to the
related interest rate cap agreement.

            Section 9.02 Prohibited Transactions and Activities.

            None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall
sell, dispose of, or substitute for any of the Mortgage Loans, except in a
disposition pursuant to (i) the foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan, (ii) the
bankruptcy of the Trust Fund, (iii) the termination of any REMIC pursuant to
Article X of this Agreement, (iv) a substitution pursuant to Article II of this
Agreement, (v) a repurchase of Mortgage Loans pursuant to Article II of this
Agreement or (vi) an optional purchase by the Master Servicer pursuant to
Section 3.16 of this Agreement, nor acquire any assets for any REMIC, nor sell
or dispose of any investments in the Distribution Account for gain, nor accept
any contributions to any REMIC after the Closing Date, unless it has received an
Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party causing such sale, disposition,
or substitution) that such disposition, acquisition, substitution, or acceptance
will not (a) affect adversely the status of such REMIC as a REMIC or of the
interests therein other than the Class R Certificate as the regular interests
therein, (b) affect the distribution of interest or principal on the
Certificates, (c) result in the encumbrance of the assets transferred or
assigned to the Trust Fund (except pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement)
or (d) cause such REMIC to be subject to a tax on prohibited transactions or
prohibited contributions pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.

            Section 9.03 Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and Loss
of REMIC Status.

            In the event that any REMIC formed hereunder fails to qualify as a
REMIC, loses its status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a
result of a prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC
Provisions due to the negligent performance by the Master Servicer of its duties
and obligations set forth herein, the Master Servicer shall indemnify the Holder
of the Class R Certificate against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from such negligence; provided,
however, that the Master Servicer shall not be liable for any such Losses
attributable to the action or inaction of the Trustee, the Depositor or the
Holder of the Class R Certificate, as applicable, nor for any such Losses
resulting from misinformation provided by the Holder of the Class R Certificate
on which the Master Servicer has relied. The foregoing shall not be deemed to
limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of the Class R
Certificate now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, in no event shall the Master Servicer have any liability (1)
for any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in compliance
with the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the terms of, this
Agreement, (2) for any Losses other than arising out of a negligent performance
by the Master Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth herein, and (3)
for any special or consequential damages to Certificateholders (in addition to
payment of principal and interest on the Certificates).

            Section 9.04 REO Property.

            (a) Subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations as
shall at any time be in force, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trust hereunder, shall
not rent, lease, or otherwise earn income on behalf of any REMIC with respect to
any REO Property which might cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as
"foreclosure" property within the meaning of section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or
result in the receipt by any REMIC of any "income from non-permitted assets"
within the meaning of section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or any "net income from
foreclosure property" which is subject to tax under the REMIC Provisions unless
the Master Servicer has advised, or has caused the applicable Master Servicer to
advise, the Trustee in writing to the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions,
such action would not adversely affect the status of any REMIC as a REMIC and
any income generated for such REMIC by the REO Property would not result in the
imposition of a tax upon such REMIC.

            (b) The Master Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to sell any
REO Property for its fair market value. In any event, however, the Master
Servicer shall dispose of any REO Property before the close of the third
calendar year beginning after the year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund
unless the Master Servicer has received a grant of extension from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant
proposed legislation and under applicable state law, any REMIC may hold REO
Property for a longer period without adversely affecting its REMIC status or
causing the imposition of a Federal or state tax upon any REMIC. If the Master
Servicer has received such an extension, then the Master Servicer shall continue
to attempt to sell the REO Property for its fair market value as determined in
good faith by the Master Servicer for such longer period as such extension
permits (the "Extended Period"). If the Master Servicer has not received such an
extension and the Master Servicer is unable to sell the REO Property within 33
months after its acquisition by the Trust Fund or if the Master Servicer has
received such an extension, and the Master Servicer is unable to sell the REO
Property within the period ending three months before the close of the Extended
Period, the Master Servicer shall, before the end of the applicable period, (i)
purchase such REO Property at a price equal to the REO Property's fair market
value as determined in good faith by the Master Servicer or (ii) auction the REO
Property to the highest bidder (which may be the Master Servicer) in an auction
reasonably designed to produce a fair price prior to the expiration of the
applicable period.

            Section 9.05 Grantor Trust Administration.

            The parties intend that the portions of the Trust Fund consisting of
the REMIC 4 Regular Interests, the right of the Class P Certificates to receive
Prepayment Charges, Originator Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts and Servicer
Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts, the right of the Offered Certificates to
receive Cap Carryover Amounts, the Reserve Account and the right of the Class CE
Certificates to receive Yield Maintenance Agreement Payments subject to the
obligation of the Class CE Certificates to pay Cap Carryover Amounts, shall be
treated as a "grantor trust" under the Code, and the provisions hereof shall be
interpreted consistently with this intention. In furtherance of such intention,
the Trustee shall furnish or cause to be furnished (i) to the Holders of the
Offered Certificates and (ii) to the Holder of the Class CE Certificates and
shall file or cause to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service together with
Form 1041 or such other form as may be applicable, their allocable shares of
income and expenses with respect to the property held by the Grantor Trust, at
the time or times and in the manner required by the Code.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                   TERMINATION

            Section 10.01 Termination.

            (a) The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Master
Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar created
hereby (other than the obligation of the Trustee to make certain payments to
Certificateholders after the final Distribution Date and the obligation of the
Master Servicer to send certain notices as hereinafter set forth) shall
terminate upon notice to the Trustee upon the earliest of (i) the Distribution
Date on which the Certificate Principal Balance of each Class of Certificates
has been reduced to zero, (ii) the final payment or other liquidation of the
last Mortgage Loan in the Trust, and (iii) the optional purchase by the Majority
Class CE Certificateholders and the Master Servicer of the Mortgage Loans as
described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the trust
created hereby continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the
last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late ambassador of
the United States to the Court of St. James, living on the date hereof.

            The Majority Class CE Certificateholders and the Master Servicer,
acting together and not individually, may, at their option, terminate the Trust
Fund and retire the Offered Certificates on the next succeeding Distribution
Date upon which the aggregate current Pool Balance is less than 10% of the
aggregate Pool Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date by
purchasing all of the outstanding (i) Mortgage Loans in the Trust Fund at a
price equal to the sum of the outstanding Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Loans and except to the extent previously advanced by the Master Servicer,
accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the weighted average of the Mortgage
Interest Rates through the end of the Collection Period preceding the final
Distribution Date plus unreimbursed Servicing Advances, Advances and any unpaid
Servicing Fees allocable to such Mortgage Loans and (ii) REO Properties in the
Trust Fund at a price equal to their fair market value as determined in good
faith by the Master Servicer (the "Termination Price"). If the Majority Class CE
Certificateholders or the Master Servicer is subject to regulation by the OCC,
the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the Office of Thrift Supervision, however, the
option may not be exercised unless the aggregate fair market value of the
Mortgage Loans and REO Properties is greater than or equal to the Termination
Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party may exercise this optional
purchase right unless any Reimbursement Amount owed to the Trust pursuant to
Section 2.03 hereof has been paid.

            In connection with any such purchase pursuant to the preceding
paragraph, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee for deposit in the
Distribution Account all amounts then on deposit in the Collection Account (less
amounts permitted to be withdrawn by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section
3.07), which deposit shall be deemed to have occurred immediately following such
purchase.

            Any such purchase shall be accomplished by delivery on the
Determination Date before such Distribution Date of the Termination Price to the
Trustee for deposit into the Distribution Account as part of Available Funds.

            (b) Notice of any termination, specifying the Distribution Date
(which shall be a date that would otherwise be a Distribution Date) upon which
the Certificateholders may surrender their Certificates to the Trustee for
payment of the final distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by
the Trustee upon the Trustee receiving notice of such date from the Majority
Class CE Certificateholders and the Master Servicer, by letter to the
Certificateholders mailed not earlier than the 15th day of the month preceding
the month of such final distribution and not later than the 15th day of the
month of such final distribution specifying (1) the Distribution Date upon which
final distribution of the Certificates will be made upon presentation and
surrender of such Certificates at the office or agency of the Trustee therein
designated, (2) the amount of any such final distribution and (3) that the
Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable,
distributions being made only upon presentation and surrender of the
Certificates at the office or agency of the Trustee therein specified. Not less
than five (5) Business Days prior to such Determination Date relating to such
Distribution Date, the Trustee shall notify the Originator and the Seller of the
amount of any unpaid Reimbursement Amount owed to the Trust.

            (c) Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee
shall cause to be distributed to the Holders of the Certificates on the
Distribution Date for such final distribution, in proportion to the Percentage
Interests of their respective Class and to the extent that funds are available
for such purpose, an amount equal to the amount required to be distributed to
such Holders in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4.01 and 4.02 for
such Distribution Date.

            (d) In the event that all Certificateholders shall not surrender
their Certificates for final payment and cancellation on or before such final
Distribution Date, the Trustee shall promptly following such date cause all
funds in the Distribution Account not distributed in final distribution to
Certificateholders to be withdrawn therefrom and credited to the remaining
Certificateholders by depositing such funds in a separate escrow account for the
benefit of such Certificateholders, and the Master Servicer shall give a second
written notice to the remaining Certificateholders, to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect
thereto. If within nine months after the second notice all the Certificates
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Class R Certificateholder
shall be entitled to all unclaimed funds and other assets which remain subject
hereto (except with respect to the Class CE and Class P Certificates) and the
Trustee upon transfer of such funds shall be discharged of any responsibility
for such funds, and all other Certificateholders shall look to the Class R
Certificateholder for payment.

            Section 10.02 Additional Termination Requirements.

            (a) In the event that the Majority Class CE Certificateholders and
Master Servicer exercise their purchase option as provided in Section 10.01, the
Trust shall be terminated in accordance with the following additional
requirements, unless the Trustee shall have been furnished with an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the failure of the Trust to comply with the
requirements of this Section will not (i) result in the imposition of taxes on
"prohibited transactions" of the Trust as defined in Section 860F of the Code or
(ii) cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust Fund to fail to qualify as a
REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding:

            (i) The Trustee shall designate a date within 90 days prior to the
      final Distribution Date as the date of adoption of plans of complete
      liquidation of each of REMIC 1, REMIC 2, REMIC 3 and REMIC 4 and shall
      specify such date in the final federal income tax return of each REMIC;

            (ii) After the date of adoption of such plans of complete
      liquidation and at or prior to the final Distribution Date, the Trustee
      shall sell all of the assets of the Trust to the Majority Class CE
      Certificateholders and the Master Servicer for cash; and

            (iii) At the time of the making of the final payment on the
      Certificates, the Trustee shall distribute or credit, or cause to be
      distributed or credited in the following order of priority (A) (i) to the
      Holders of each of the Class A-1, Class A-1A, Class A-2 and Class A-3
      Certificates, pro rata, and (ii) to the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3,
      Class M-4, Class M-5 and Class M-6 Certificates, the related Certificate
      Principal Balance, as applicable, plus one month's interest thereon at the
      applicable Certificate Interest Rate, (B) to the Class CE Certificates,
      the amount of any remaining Monthly Excess Cash Flow Amounts not
      previously distributed thereon, (C) to the remaining REMIC Regular
      Interests the amounts allocable thereto pursuant to Section 4.08 and (D)
      to the Class R Certificateholder, all cash on hand in respect of the
      REMICs after such payment (other than cash retained to meet claims) and
      the Trust shall terminate at such time.

            (b) By their acceptance of Certificates, the Holders thereof hereby
agree to appoint the Trustee as their attorney in fact to: (i) designate such
date of adoption of plans of complete liquidation and (ii) to take such other
action in connection therewith as may be reasonably required to carry out such
plans of complete liquidation all in accordance with the terms hereof.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            Section 11.01 Amendment.

            This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Depositor,
the Master Servicer and the Trustee; and without the consent of the
Certificateholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or mistake, (ii) to correct,
modify or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any
other provision herein or the Prospectus Supplement, (iii) to make any other
provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Agreement,
which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; or (iv)
to comply with any requirements imposed by the Code; provided, however, that any
such action listed in clause (iii) above shall not adversely affect in any
respect the interests of any Certificateholder, as evidenced by (i) notice in
writing to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee from the Rating
Agencies that such action will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the
rating of any outstanding Class of Certificates with respect to which it is a
Rating Agency, or (ii) an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Master Servicer
and the Trustee.

            In addition, this Agreement may be amended from time to time by the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Majority
Certificateholders for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Certificates; provided,
however, that no such amendment or waiver shall (x) reduce in any manner the
amount of, or delay the timing of, payments on the Certificates which are
required to be made on any Certificate without the consent of the Holder of such
Certificate, (y) adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the
Holders of any Class of Certificates in a manner other than as described in
clause (x) above, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates of such
Class evidencing at least a majority of the Percentage Interest in such Class,
or (z) reduce the percentage of Voting Rights required by clause (y) above
without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates of such Class then
outstanding. Upon approval of an amendment, a copy of such amendment shall be
sent to the Rating Agencies. Prior to the execution of any amendment to this
Agreement, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an Opinion of
Counsel (at the expense of the Person seeking such amendment) stating that the
execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement. The
Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which
affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Trustee shall not consent to any amendment to this Agreement unless it shall
have first received an Opinion of Counsel, delivered by (and at the expense of)
the Person seeking such Amendment, to the effect that such amendment will not
result in the imposition of a tax on any REMIC constituting part of the Trust
Fund pursuant to the REMIC Provisions or cause any REMIC constituting part of
the Trust Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates
are outstanding and that the amendment is being made in accordance with the
terms hereof.

            Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Trustee shall
furnish, at the expense of the Person that requested the amendment if such
Person is the Master Servicer (but in no event at the expense of the Trustee),
otherwise at the expense of the Trust, a copy of such amendment and the Opinion
of Counsel referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph to the Master
Servicer and each Rating Agency.

            It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders
under this Section 11.01 to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment; instead it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject to
such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

            Section 11.02 Recordation of Agreement; Counterparts.

            To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement is subject
to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property records in
all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or all of the
properties subject to the Mortgages are situated, and in any other appropriate
public recording office or elsewhere, such recordation to be effected by the
Master Servicer at the expense of the Trust, but only upon direction of
Certificateholders, accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
recordation materially and beneficially affects the interests of the
Certificateholders.

            For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this Agreement as
herein provided and for other purposes, this Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall together constitute but
one and the same instrument.

            Section 11.03 Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders.

            The death or incapacity of any Certificateholder shall not (i)
operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust, (ii) entitle such
Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the
Trust, or (iii) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties hereto or any of them.

            Except as expressly provided for herein, no Certificateholder shall
have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the operation and
management of the Trust, or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall
anything herein set forth or contained in the terms of the Certificates be
construed so as to constitute the Certificateholders from time to time as
partners or members of an association; nor shall any Certificateholder be under
any liability to any third person by reason of any action taken by the parties
to this Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.

            No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any provision
of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at
law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless such Holder
previously shall have given to the Trustee a written notice of default and of
the continuance thereof, as herein provided, and unless also the Holders of
Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights shall have made
written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in
its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such
reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for 60 days after
its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected
or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding. It is understood
and intended, and expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with every
other Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of
Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of any
provision of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the
Holders of any other of such Certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain
priority over or preference to any other such Holder, which priority or
preference is not otherwise provided for herein, or to enforce any right under
this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable
and common benefit of all Certificateholders. For the protection and enforcement
of the provisions of this Section 11.03 each and every Certificateholder and the
Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in
equity.

            Section 11.04 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

            This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the parties

any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in any inconvenient forum and further irrevocably waives the right to object,
with respect to such claim, suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party, provided that
service of process has been made by any lawful means.

of substantially similar tenor signed by such Certificateholders in person or by
agent duly appointed in writing; and such action shall become effective when

            This certifies that _______________ is the registered owner of a
Percentage Interest (obtained by dividing the Initial Certificate Principal
Balance of this Certificate by the Original Class Certificate Principal Balance
of the Class A-1 Certificates) in that certain beneficial ownership interest

to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as specified above (the
"Agreement"), among Asset Backed Funding Corporation (hereinafter called the
"Depositor," which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement), the
Master Servicer and the Trustee, a summary of certain of the pertinent
provisions of which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not defined herein,
the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.
This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such

permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

"Depositor," which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement), the
Master Servicer and the Trustee, a summary of certain of the pertinent
provisions of which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not defined herein,
the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.
This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such

designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest

certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

      THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT REPRESENT AN OBLIGATION OF OR INTEREST IN ASSET
      BACKED FUNDING CORPORATION, THE MASTER SERVICER, THE TRUSTEE OR ANY OF
      THEIR AFFILIATES. THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT GUARANTEED BY ANY AGENCY OR
      INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE UNITED STATES.

            This certifies that _______________ is the registered owner of a
Percentage Interest (obtained by dividing the Initial Certificate Principal
Balance of this Certificate by the Original Class Certificate Principal Balance
of the Class A-2 Certificates) in that certain beneficial ownership interest
evidenced by all the Class A-2 Certificates in the Trust Fund created pursuant
to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as specified above (the
"Agreement"), among Asset Backed Funding Corporation (hereinafter called the
"Depositor," which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement), the
Master Servicer and the Trustee, a summary of certain of the pertinent
provisions of which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not defined herein,
the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.
This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such
Distribution Date (the "Record Date"), from funds in the Distribution Account in
an amount equal to the product of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this
Certificate and the amount required to be distributed to the Holders of Class
A-2 Certificates on such Distribution Date pursuant to the Agreement; provided,
however, that if any Class A-2 Certificate becomes a Definitive Certificate, the
Record Date for such Certificate will be the last Business Day of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the related Distribution Date occurs.

            All distributions to the Holder of this Certificate under the
Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Trustee by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the Person
entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Certificate Registrar
in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Record Date immediately
prior to such Distribution Date and is the registered owner of Class A-2
Certificates, or by check mailed by first class mail to the address of the
Person entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on the
Certificate Register, provided that the Certificate Registrar may deduct a
reasonable wire transfer fee from any payment made by wire transfer.
Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and
only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency
appointed by the Trustee for that purpose as provided in the Agreement.

            The Certificate Interest Rate for the Class A-2 Certificates for
each Distribution Date will be the least of (i) One-Month LIBOR as of the
related LIBOR Determination Date plus the Class A-2 Certificate Margin, (ii) the
Group 2 Maximum Rate Cap and (iii) the Group 2 Cap. Interest will accrue on the
Class A-2 Certificates during each Interest Accrual Period at the Certificate
Interest Rate.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest
in the Class A-2 Certificates.

            The Class A-2 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

provisions of which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not defined herein,
the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.
This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and

by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the

Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such
Distribution Date (the "Record Date"), from funds in the Distribution Account in

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest
in the Class A-3 Certificates.

            The Class A-3 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such

certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            This certificate is subordinated in right of payment to the Class A
Certificates as described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement referred to
herein.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued

notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            This certifies that _________________ is the registered owner of a

Balance of this Certificate by the Original Class Certificate Principal Balance
of the Class M-3 Certificates) in that certain beneficial ownership interest
evidenced by all the Class M-3 Certificates in the Trust Fund created pursuant
to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as specified above (the
"Agreement"), among Asset Backed Funding Corporation (hereinafter called the
"Depositor," which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement), the
Master Servicer and the Trustee, a summary of certain of the pertinent
provisions of which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not defined herein,
the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.
This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such
Distribution Date (the "Record Date"), from funds in the Distribution Account in
an amount equal to the product of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this
Certificate and the amount required to be distributed to the Holders of Class
M-3 Certificates on such Distribution Date pursuant to the Agreement; provided,
however, that if any Class M-3 Certificate becomes a Definitive Certificate, the
Record Date for such Certificate will be the last Business Day of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the related Distribution Date occurs.

            All distributions to the Holder of this Certificate under the
Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Trustee by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the Person
entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Certificate Registrar
in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Record Date immediately
prior to such Distribution Date and is the registered owner of Class M-3
Certificates, or by check mailed by first class mail to the address of the
Person entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on the

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and
only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency
appointed by the Trustee for that purpose as provided in the Agreement.

            The Certificate Interest Rate for the Class M-3 Certificates for
each Distribution Date will be the least of (i) One-Month LIBOR as of the
related LIBOR Determination Date plus the Class M-3 Certificate Margin, (ii) the
Pool Maximum Rate Cap and (iii) the Pool Cap. Interest will accrue on the Class
M-3 Certificates during each Interest Accrual Period at the Certificate Interest
Rate.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest
in the Class M-3 Certificates.

            The Class M-3 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            This certificate is subordinated in right of payment to the Class A
Certificates, Class M-1 Certificate and Class M-2 Certificates as described in
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement referred to herein.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Business Day immediately preceding such
Distribution Date (the "Record Date"), from funds in the Distribution Account in
an amount equal to the product of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this
Certificate and the amount required to be distributed to the Holders of Class
M-4 Certificates on such Distribution Date pursuant to the Agreement; provided,
however, that if any Class M-4 Certificate becomes a Definitive Certificate, the
Record Date for such Certificate will be the last Business Day of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the related Distribution Date occurs.

            All distributions to the Holder of this Certificate under the
Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Trustee by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the Person
entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Certificate Registrar
in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Record Date immediately
prior to such Distribution Date and is the registered owner of Class M-4
Certificates, or by check mailed by first class mail to the address of the
Person entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on the
Certificate Register, provided that the Certificate Registrar may deduct a
reasonable wire transfer fee from any payment made by wire transfer.
Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and
only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency
appointed by the Trustee for that purpose as provided in the Agreement.

            The Certificate Interest Rate for the Class M-4 Certificates for
each Distribution Date will be the least of (i) One-Month LIBOR as of the
related LIBOR Determination Date plus the Class M-4 Certificate Margin, (ii) the
Pool Maximum Rate Cap and (iii) the Pool Cap. Interest will accrue on the Class
M-4 Certificates during each Interest Accrual Period at the Certificate Interest
Rate.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest
in the Class M-4 Certificates.

            The Class M-4 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            This certificate is subordinated in right of payment to the Class A
Certificates, Class M-1 Certificate, Class M-2 Certificates and Class M-3
Certificates as described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement referred to
herein.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified

limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new

or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other

acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the

less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or

Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master

notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and

attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust

Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            This certifies that __________________________________ is the

of the pertinent provisions of which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not
defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in
the Agreement. This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms,
provisions and conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of
this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the last Business Day of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the related Distribution Date occurs (the "Record

in the Distribution Account in an amount equal to the product of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount required to be distributed
to the Holders of Class P Certificates on such Distribution Date pursuant to the
Agreement.

            All distributions to the Holder of this Certificate under the
Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Trustee by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the Person
entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Certificate Registrar

Person entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on the
Certificate Register, provided that the Certificate Registrar may deduct a
reasonable wire transfer fee from any payment made by wire transfer.
Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and
only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency
appointed by the Trustee for that purpose as provided in the Agreement.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing the Percentage
Interest specified on the face hereof.

            The Class P Certificates are limited in right of payment to
Prepayment Charges received on the Mortgage Loans, Originator Prepayment Charge
Payment Amount and Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No transfer of this Certificate shall be made unless that transfer
is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and
effective registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws,
or is made in a transaction that does not require such registration or
qualification. In the event that a transfer is to be made without registration
or qualification, the Certificate Registrar shall require, in order to assure
compliance with such laws, either (i) that the Certificateholder desiring to
effect the transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee each
execute a representation letter in the form described by the Agreement
certifying to the Certificate Registrar the facts surrounding the transfer, or
(ii) unless such transfer is made in reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act,
that the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar receive an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to them that such transfer may be made without such registration or
qualification, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the
Depositor, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar, in their respective
capacities as such. None of the Depositor, the Certificate Registrar or the
Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the Class of Certificates specified
on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any other securities law or to take any
action not otherwise required under the Agreement to permit the transfer of such
Certificates without registration or qualification. Any such Certificateholder
desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Registrar and any Master Servicer
against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not
made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

            No transfer of a Certificate or any interest therein may be made to
employee benefit plans and certain other retirement plans and arrangements,
including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and
collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans, accounts
or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any materially similar
provisions of applicable federal, state or local law (collectively, "Plans") or
any person who is directly or indirectly purchasing the Certificate or interest
therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a
Plan.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

which term includes any successor entity under the Agreement), the Master
Servicer and the Trustee, a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of
which is set forth hereafter. To the extent not defined herein, the capitalized
terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement. This Certificate
is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the
Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the last Business Day of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the related Distribution Date occurs (the "Record
Date"), from funds in the Distribution Account in the amount required to be

pursuant to the Agreement.

            All distributions to the Holder of this Certificate under the
Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Trustee by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the Person
entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the Certificate Registrar
in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Record Date immediately
prior to such Distribution Date and is the registered owner of Class R
Certificate, or by check mailed by first class mail to the address of the Person
entitled thereto, as such name and address shall appear on the Certificate

the final distribution on this Certificate will be made after due notice by the
Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and only upon presentation and
surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency appointed by the Trustee
for that purpose as provided in the Agreement.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates of the Series specified on the face
hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing the Percentage
Interest specified on the face hereof.

            The Class R Certificate is limited in right of payment to certain
collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the
Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Rights identified in the agreement. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates
of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No transfer of this Certificate shall be made unless that transfer
is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and
effective registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws,
or is made in a transaction that does not require such registration or
qualification. In the event that a transfer is to be made without registration
or qualification, the Certificate Registrar shall require, in order to assure
compliance with such laws, either (i) that the Certificateholder desiring to
effect the transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee each
execute a representation letter in the form described by the Agreement
certifying to the Certificate Registrar the facts surrounding the transfer, or
(ii) unless such transfer is made in reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act,
that the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar receive an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to them that such transfer may be made without such registration or
qualification, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the
Depositor, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar, in their respective
capacities as such. None of the Depositor, the Certificate Registrar or the
Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the Class of Certificates specified
on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any other securities law or to take any
action not otherwise required under the Agreement to permit the transfer of such
Certificates without registration or qualification. Any such Certificateholder
desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Registrar and any Master Servicer
against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not
made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

            No transfer of this Certificate or any interest therein may be made
to employee benefit plans and certain other retirement plans and arrangements,
including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and
collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans, accounts
or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any materially similar
provisions of applicable federal, state or local law (collectively, "Plans") or
any person who is directly or indirectly purchasing the Certificate or interest
therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a
Plan.

            The Holder of this Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, shall be
deemed for all purposes to have consented to the provisions of Section 5.02 of
the Agreement and to any amendment of the Agreement deemed necessary by counsel
of the Depositor to ensure that the transfer of this Certificate to any Person
other than a Permitted Transferee or any other Person will not cause the Trust
to cease to qualify as four separate REMICs or cause the imposition of a tax
upon the Trust.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee or
the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

            Section 2.01 Sale of Mortgage Loans. The Seller does hereby agree to

Agreement and (y) to deliver to the Purchaser and the Trustee a computer file
containing a true and complete list of all the Mortgage Loans specifying, among

which is set forth as Exhibits D-1 and D-2 to the Pooling and Servicing

            In connection with such transfer and assignment of the Mortgage
Loans, the Seller shall, on behalf of the Purchaser, deliver to and deposit with
the Trustee the following documents or instruments (with respect to each
Mortgage Loan, a "Mortgage File") with respect to each Mortgage Loan so
transferred and assigned:

            (i) the original Mortgage Note, endorsed either (A) in blank or (B)
      in the following form: "Pay to the order of Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
      National Association, as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing
      Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2003, among Asset Backed Funding
      Corporation, Option One Mortgage Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank
      Minnesota, National Association, ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates, Series
      2003-OPT1, without recourse," or with respect to any lost Mortgage Note, a
      Lost Note Affidavit, together with a copy of the related mortgage note;

            (ii) the original Mortgage with evidence of recording thereon, and
      the original recorded power of attorney, if the Mortgage was executed
      pursuant to a power of attorney, with evidence of recording thereon or, if
      such Mortgage or power of attorney has been submitted for recording but
      has not been returned from the applicable public recording office, has
      been lost or is not otherwise available, a copy of such Mortgage or power
      of attorney, as the case may be, certified to be a true and complete copy
      of the original submitted for recording;

            (iii) an original Assignment of Mortgage, in form and substance
      acceptable for recording. The Mortgage shall be assigned either (A) in
      blank or (B) to "Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, as
      Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of July 1,
      2003, among Asset Backed Funding Corporation, Option One Mortgage
      Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, ABFC
      Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, without recourse";

            (iv) an original copy of any intervening assignment of Mortgage
      showing a complete chain of assignments;

            (v) the original or a certified copy of the lender's title insurance
      policy; and

            (vi) the original or copies of each assumption, modification,
      written assurance or substitution agreement, if any.

            If any of the documents referred to in Section 2.02(ii), (iii) or
(iv) above has as of the Closing Date been submitted for recording but either
(x) has not been returned from the applicable public recording office or (y) has
been lost or such public recording office has retained the original of such
document, the obligations of the Seller to deliver such documents shall be
deemed to be satisfied upon (1) delivery to the Trustee no later than the
Closing Date, of a copy of each such document certified by the Seller or the
Company in the case of (x) above or the applicable public recording office in
the case of (y) above to be a true and complete copy of the original that was
submitted for recording and (2) if such copy is certified by the Seller,
delivery to the Trustee, promptly upon receipt thereof of either the original or
a copy of such document certified by the applicable public recording office to
be a true and complete copy of the original. If the original lender's title
insurance policy was not delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(v) above, the Seller
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, a written commitment or
interim binder or preliminary report of title issued by the title insurance or
escrow company, with the original to be delivered to the Trustee, promptly upon
receipt thereof. The Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Trustee promptly upon receipt thereof any other original documents constituting
a part of a Mortgage File received with respect to any Mortgage Loan, including,
but not limited to, any original documents evidencing an assumption or
modification of any Mortgage Loan.

            Upon discovery or receipt of notice of any materially defective
document in, or that a document is missing from, a Mortgage File, the Seller
shall have 120 days to cure such defect or deliver such missing document to the
Trustee or 150 days following the Closing Date, in the case of missing Mortgages
or Assignments (or within 90 days of the earlier of Seller's discovery or
receipt of notification if such defect would cause the related Mortgage Loan not
to be a "qualified mortgage" for REMIC purposes or that the Mortgage Loan is
defective in a manner that would cause it to be a "defective obligation" within
the meaning of Treasury regulations relating to REMICs). If the Seller does not
cure such defect or deliver such missing document within such time period, the
Seller shall either repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan in
accordance with Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

            It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Seller set
forth in this Section 2.02 to cure, repurchase or substitute for a defective
Mortgage Loan constitute the sole remedies of the Purchaser respecting a missing
or defective document.

            The Purchaser hereby acknowledges its acceptance of all right, title
and interest to the Mortgage Loans and other property, now existing and
hereafter created, conveyed to it pursuant to Section 2.01.

            The parties hereto intend that the transaction set forth herein be a
sale by the Seller to the Purchaser of all the Seller's right, title and
interest in and to the Mortgage Loans and other property described above. In the
event the transaction set forth herein is deemed not to be a sale, the Seller
hereby grants to the Purchaser a security interest in all of the Seller's right,
title and interest in, to and under the Mortgage Loans and other property
described above, whether now existing or hereafter created, to secure all of the
Seller's obligations hereunder; and this Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law. The Seller and the Purchaser shall, to the
extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to
ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the
Mortgage Loans, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected
security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained
as such throughout the term of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

            In the event that any Mortgage Note is endorsed in blank as of the
Closing Date, promptly following the Closing Date the Seller shall cause to be
completed such endorsements "Pay to the order of Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
National Association, as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
dated as of July 1, 2003, among Asset Backed Funding Corporation, Option One
Mortgage Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, ABFC
Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-OPT1, without recourse."

            Section 2.03 Payment of Purchase Price for the Mortgage Loans. In
consideration of the sale of the Mortgage Loans from the Seller to the Purchaser
on the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees (i) to pay to the Seller on the
Closing Date by transfer of immediately available funds, as directed by the
Seller, an amount equal to $757,988,819.93 and (ii) deliver to or at the
direction of the Seller on the Closing Date, the Class CE, Class P and Class R
Certificates, in respect of the Mortgage Loans (collectively, the "Purchase
Price"). The Seller shall pay, and be billed directly for, all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the issuance of the
Certificates, including, without limitation, printing fees incurred in
connection with the prospectus relating to the Certificates, blue sky
registration fees and expenses, fees and reasonable expenses of Purchaser's
counsel, fees of the rating agencies requested to rate the Certificates,
accountant's fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the Trustee and
other out-of-pocket costs, if any.


                                   ARTICLE III

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; REMEDIES FOR BREACH

            Section 3.01 Seller Representations and Warranties Relating to the
Mortgage Loans

            The representations and warranties with respect to the Mortgage
Loans in the Underlying Sale Agreement were made as of April 17, 2003 and May
23, 2003. The Seller's right, title and interest in such representations and
warranties and the remedies in connection therewith have been assigned to the
Purchaser pursuant to that certain Assignment, Assumption and Recognition
Agreement, dated August 20, 2003 among the Seller, as assignee, the Purchaser,
as assignor, the Company and the Trustee. To the extent that any fact, condition
or event with respect to a Mortgage Loan constitutes a breach of both (i) a
representation or warranty of the Company under the Underlying Sale Agreement
and (ii) a representation or warranty of the Seller under this Agreement (other
than Section 3.01(k) below), the only right or remedy of the Purchaser shall be
the right to enforce the obligations of the Company under any applicable
representation or warranty made by it. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that the representations and warranties of the Seller in this Section 3.01 are
applicable only to facts, conditions or events that do not constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Company in the Underlying Sale
Agreement. The Seller shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any
breach of a representation or warranty made by it with respect to the Mortgage
Loans (other than the representations made in Section 3.01(k) and Section
3.01(l) below) if the fact, condition or event constituting such breach also
constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company in the
Underlying Sale Agreement, without regard to whether the Company fulfills its
contractual obligations in respect of such representation or warranty. If,
however, the Originator fails to reimburse the Trustee for any costs or damages
incurred by the Trust in connection with a breach of the Originator's
representation set forth in Section 3.03(i) of the Underlying Sale Agreement
(such amount, the "Reimbursement Amount"), the Seller shall pay the
Reimbursement Amount to the Trust. The Reimbursement Amount shall be delivered
to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account within 10 days
from the date the Seller was notified by the Trustee of the amount of such costs
and damages. Subject to the foregoing, the Seller represents and warrants upon
delivery of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser hereunder, as to each, that:

            (a) The information set forth with respect to the Mortgage Loans on
the Mortgage Loan Schedule attached hereto as Schedule I provides an accurate
listing of the Mortgage Loans, and the information with respect to each Mortgage
Loan on the Mortgage Loan Schedule is true and correct in all material respects
at the date or dates respecting which such information is given;

            (b) No Mortgage Loan was 30 days or more contractually delinquent as
of the Cut-off Date. The Seller has not waived any default, breach, violation or
event of acceleration, and the Seller has not taken any action to waive any
default, breach, violation or even of acceleration, with respect to any Mortgage
Loan;

            (c) There are no delinquent taxes, assessments that could become a
lien prior to the related Mortgage or insurance premiums affecting the related
Mortgaged Property;

            (d) Each Mortgage has not been satisfied, canceled, subordinated or
rescinded, in whole or in part, and the related Mortgaged Property has not been
released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor has any
instrument been executed that would effect any such satisfaction, cancellation,
subordination, recission or release;

            (e) Other than any Mortgage Loan that is less than 30 days
contractually delinquent as of the Cut-off Date, there is no material default,
breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under any Mortgage or the
related Mortgage Note and no event which, with the passage of time or with
notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, and neither the
Seller nor its predecessors have waived any material default, breach, violation
or event of acceleration;

            (f) Each Mortgaged Property is free of material damage that would
affect adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property as security for the
Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises were intended;

            (g) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, there is no proceeding
pending for the total or partial condemnation of the Mortgaged Property;

            (h) Each Mortgaged Property is lawfully occupied under applicable
law; all inspections, licenses and certificates required to be made or issued
with respect to all occupied portions of each Mortgaged Property and, with
respect to the use and occupancy of the same, including but not limited to
certificates of occupancy, have been made or obtained from the appropriate
authorities, except where the failure would not have a material adverse effect
upon the Mortgage Loan;

            (i) No Mortgage Loan is in foreclosure;

            (j) Each Mortgage Loan is a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning
of Section 860G of the Code and Treas. Reg ss. 1.860G-2;

            (k) Any and all requirements of any federal, state or local law
including, without limitation, usury, truth in lending, real estate settlement
procedures, consumer credit protections, all applicable predatory and abusive
lending laws, equal credit opportunity or disclosure laws applicable to the
origination of each Mortgage Loan have been complied with;

            (l) No Mortgage Loan is a "high cost" loan as defined under any
federal, state or local law applicable to such Mortgage Loan at the time of its
origination;

            (m) The Seller is the sole owner of record and holder of the
Mortgage Loan and the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage are not assigned or
pledged, and the Seller has good and marketable title thereto and has full right
and authority to transfer and sell the Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser. The
Seller is transferring the Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all
encumbrances, liens, pledges, equities, participation interests, claims,
agreements with other parties to sell or otherwise transfer the Mortgage Loan,
charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan;

            (n) The terms of the Mortgage Note and Mortgage have not been
impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect, except by a written
instrument which has been recorded, if necessary, to protect the interests of
the Purchaser and maintain the lien priority of the Mortgage and which has been
delivered to the Purchaser or its designee. The substance of any such waiver,
alteration or modification has been approved by the title insurer, to the extent
required by the policy, and its terms are reflected on the Mortgage Loan
Schedule. No instrument of waiver, alteration or modification has been executed,
and no Mortgagor has been released, in whole or in part, except in connection
with an assumption agreement approved by the title insurer, to the extent
required by the policy, and which assumption agreement is part of the Mortgage
File delivered to the Purchaser or its designee and the terms of which are
reflected on the related Mortgage Loan Schedule;

            (o) The Seller has not dealt with any broker, investment banker,
agent or other Person (other than the Company and the Underwriters) who may be
entitled to any commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the
Mortgage Loans; and

            (p) All points and fees related to each Mortgage Loan were disclosed
in writing to the Mortgagor in accordance with applicable state and federal law
and regulation. With respect to the Group 1 Mortgage Loans only and except in
the case of a Mortgage Loan in an original principal amount of less than $60,000
which would have resulted in an unprofitable origination, no Mortgagor was
charged "points and fees" (whether or not financed) in an amount greater than 5%
of the principal amount of such loan, such 5% limitation is calculated in
accordance with Fannie Mae's anti-predatory lending requirements as set forth in
the Fannie Mae Selling Guide.

            With respect to the representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 3.01 that are made to the best of the Seller's knowledge or as to which
the Seller has no knowledge, if it is discovered by the Purchaser, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee that the substance of such representation and warranty
is inaccurate and such inaccuracy materially and adversely affects the value of
the related Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Charge or the interest therein of the
Purchaser or the Purchaser's assignee, transferee or designee then,
notwithstanding the Seller's lack of knowledge with respect to the substance of
such representation and warranty being inaccurate at the time the representation
or warranty was made, such inaccuracy shall be deemed a breach of the applicable
representation or warranty.

            Upon discovery by the Seller, the Master Servicer, the Purchaser or
any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in this Article III that materially and
adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan or the interest therein of the
Purchaser or the Purchaser's assignee, transferee or designee, the party
discovering the breach shall give prompt written notice to the others. Subject
to the frist paragraph of this Section 3.01, within 90 days of the earlier of
its discovery or its receipt of notice of any such breach of a representation or
warranty, the Seller shall promptly cure such breach in all material respects,
or in the event such breach cannot be cured, the Seller shall repurchase the
affected Mortgage Loan or cause the removal of such Mortgage Loan from the Trust
Fund and substitute for it one or more Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans, in
either case, in accordance with Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in this Section 3.01 shall survive delivery of the respective Mortgage
Files to the Trustee on behalf of the Purchaser and shall inure to the benefit
of the Certificateholders notwithstanding any restrictive or qualified
endorsement or assignment.

            It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Seller set
forth in this Section 3.01 to cure, repurchase or substitute for a Mortgage Loan
as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty, subject to the
limitation contained in the first paragraph of this Section 3.01, and to pay the
Reimbursement Amount constitute the sole remedies of the Purchaser respecting a
breach of the representations or warranties contained in this Section 3.01.

            Section 3.02 Seller Representations and Warranties. The Seller
hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser that as of the Closing Date or
as of such date specifically provided herein:

            (a) The Seller is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing as a national banking association and has the power and authority to
own its assets and to transact the business in which it is currently engaged.
The Seller is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the business transacted by it or
properties owned or leased by it requires such qualification and in which the
failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on (i) its business,
properties, assets or condition (financial or other), (ii) the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement, (iii) the value or marketability of the
Mortgage Loans, or (iv) its ability to foreclose on the related Mortgaged
Properties.

            (b) The Seller has the power and authority to make, execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and to consummate all of the transactions
contemplated hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. When executed and
delivered, this Agreement will constitute the Seller's legal, valid and binding
obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement of
such terms may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally or creditors of national banks and by the availability of
equitable remedies, (ii) general equity principles (regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or (iii) public
policy considerations underlying the securities laws, to the extent that such
policy considerations limit the enforceability of the provisions of this
Agreement which purport to provide indemnification from securities laws
liabilities.

            (c) The Seller holds all necessary licenses, certificates and
permits from all governmental authorities necessary for conducting its business
as it is presently conducted, except for such licenses, certificates and permits
the absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Seller to conduct its business as
it is presently conducted. It is not required to obtain the consent of any other
party or any consent, license, approval or authorization from, or registration
or declaration with, any governmental authority, bureau or agency in connection
with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this
Agreement, except for such consents, licenses, approvals or authorizations, or
registrations or declarations as shall have been obtained or filed, as the case
may be, prior to the Closing Date.

            (d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (i) will not conflict with
or constitute a breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the
Seller pursuant to any material contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement,
note, lease or other instrument, agreement or document to which the Seller is a
party or by which it may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of
the Seller is subject, (ii) will not result in any violation of the provisions
of the charter or by-laws of the Seller, or any law, administrative regulation
or administrative or court decree applicable to the Seller and (iii) will not
require any filing or registration with or notice to or consent, approval,
authorization or order of any court or governmental authority or agency.

            (e) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the
ordinary course of the Seller's business.

that except for the transfer hereunder, the Seller will not sell, pledge, assign
or transfer to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to

Section 4.01 shall prevent or be deemed to prohibit the Seller from suffering to
exist upon any of the Mortgage Loans any liens for municipal or other local
taxes and other governmental charges if such taxes or governmental charges shall
not at the time be due and payable or if the Seller shall currently be
contesting the validity thereof in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            Section 6.01 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended from time to
time by the Seller and the Purchaser by written agreement signed by the Seller
and the Purchaser.

            Section 6.02 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the
obligations, rights and remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in
accordance with such laws.

            Section 6.03 Notices. All demands, notices and communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if
personally delivered at or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed
as follows:

            if to the Seller:

            Bank of America, N.A.
            100 North Tryon Street
            Charlotte, North Carolina 28255
            Attention:  General Counsel

or such other  address as may  hereafter  be  furnished  to the  Purchaser  in
writing by the Seller.

            if to the Purchaser:

            Asset Backed Funding Corporation.
            214 North Tyron Street
            21st Floor
            Charlotte, North Carolina 28255
            Attention:  Mary E. Rapoport

or such other  address as may  hereafter be furnished to the Seller in writing
by the Purchaser.

            Section 6.04 Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the
covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be held
invalid for any reason whatsoever, then such covenants, agreements, provisions
or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements,
provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement.

            Section 6.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which, when so executed, shall be deemed to be an original and such
counterparts, together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

            Section 6.06 Further Agreements. The Purchaser and the Seller each
agree to execute and deliver to the other such additional documents, instruments
or agreements as may be necessary or reasonable and appropriate to effectuate
the purposes of this Agreement or in connection with the issuance of any Series
of Certificates representing interests in the Mortgage Loans.

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as a further
inducement for the Purchaser to purchase the Mortgage Loans from the Seller, the
Seller will cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the sale of any of
the securities representing interests in the Mortgage Loans. In that connection,
the Seller will provide to the Purchaser any and all information and appropriate
verification of information, whether through letters of its auditors and counsel
or otherwise, as the Purchaser shall reasonably request and will provide to the
Purchaser such additional representations and warranties, covenants, opinions of
counsel, letters from auditors, and certificates of public officials or officers
of the Seller as are reasonably required in connection with such transactions
and the offering of investment grade securities rated by the Rating Agencies.

            Section 6.07 Intention of the Parties. It is the intention of the
parties that the Purchaser is purchasing, and the Seller is selling, the
Mortgage Loans rather than the pledging of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to
secure a loan by the Purchaser to the Seller. Accordingly, the parties hereto
each intend to treat the transaction for Federal income tax purposes and all
other purposes as a sale by the Seller and a purchase by the Purchaser of the
Mortgage Loans. The Purchaser will have the right to review the Mortgage Loans
and the related Mortgage Files to determine the characteristics of the Mortgage
Loans which will affect the Federal income tax consequences of owning the
Mortgage Loans and the Seller will cooperate with all reasonable requests made
by the Purchaser in the course of such review.

            Section 6.08 Successors and Assigns; Assignment of this Agreement.
This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Seller, the Purchaser and the Trustee. The obligations of the Seller under this
Agreement cannot be assigned or delegated to a third party without the consent
of the Purchaser and which consent shall be at the Purchaser's sole discretion,
except that the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller may assign its
obligations hereunder to any Person into which the Seller is merged or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Seller is a party or any Person succeeding to the business of the Seller. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the Purchaser is acquiring the Mortgage Loans
for the purpose of contributing them to a trust that will issue a series of
certificates representing undivided interests in such Mortgage Loans. As an
inducement to the Purchaser to purchase the Mortgage Loans, the Seller
acknowledges and consents to the assignment by the Purchaser to the Trustee of
all of the Purchaser's rights against the Seller pursuant to this Agreement
insofar as such rights relate to Mortgage Loans transferred to the Trustee and
to the enforcement or exercise of any right or remedy against the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement by the Trustee. Such enforcement of a right or remedy
by the Trustee shall have the same force and effect as if the right or remedy
had been enforced or exercised by the Purchaser directly.

            Section 6.09 Survival. The representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 hereof shall survive the purchase of the Mortgage
Loans hereunder.

COUNTY OF          )

            The undersigned, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as
follows:

            1. The undersigned is [an officer of] ____________, the proposed
Transferee of an Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificates (the
"Certificate") issued pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (the
"Agreement"), relating to the above-referenced Certificates, among Asset Backed
Funding Corporation, as depositor, Option One Mortgage Corporation, as master
servicer, and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, as trustee (the
"Trustee"). Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agreement. The Transferee has authorized
the undersigned to make this affidavit on behalf of the Transferee.

            2. The Transferee is, as of the date hereof, and will be, as of the
date of the Transfer, a Permitted Transferee. The Transferee is acquiring its
Ownership Interest in the Certificates either (i) for its own account or (ii) as
nominee, trustee or agent for another Person and has attached hereto an
affidavit from such Person in substantially the same form as this affidavit. The
Transferee has no knowledge that any such affidavit is false.

            3. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that (i) a
tax will be imposed on Transfers of the Certificate to Persons that are
Disqualified Organization; (ii) such tax will be imposed on the transferor, or,
if such Transfer is through an agent (which includes a broker, nominee or
middleman) for a Person that is a Disqualified Organization, on the agent; and
(iii) the Person otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability for
the tax if the subsequent Transferee furnished to such Person an affidavit that
such subsequent Transferee is not a Disqualified Organization and, at the time
of Transfer, such Person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is
false.

            4. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that a tax
will be imposed on a "pass-through entity" holding the Certificate if at any
time during the taxable year of the pass-through entity a Person that is a
Disqualified Organization is the record holder of an interest in such entity.
The Transferee understands that such tax will not be imposed for any period with
respect to which the record holder furnishes to the pass-through entity an
affidavit that such record holder is not a Disqualified Organization and the
pass-through entity does not have actual knowledge that such affidavit is false.
(For this purpose, a "pass-through entity" includes a regulated investment
company, a real estate investment trust or common trust fund, a partnership,
trust or estate, and certain cooperatives and, except as may be provided in
Treasury Regulations, persons holding interests in pass-through entities as a
nominee for another Person.)

            5. The Transferee has reviewed the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of
the Agreement and understands the legal consequences of the acquisition of an
Ownership Interest in the Certificate including, without limitation, the
restrictions on subsequent Transfers and the provisions regarding voiding the
Transfer and mandatory sales. The Transferee expressly agrees to be bound by and
to abide by the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the Agreement and the
restrictions noted on the face of the Certificate. The Transferee understands
and agrees that any breach of any of the representations included herein shall
render the Transfer to the Transferee contemplated hereby null and void.

            6. The Transferee agrees to require a Transfer Affidavit from any
Person to whom the Transferee attempts to Transfer its Ownership Interest in the
Certificate, and in connection with any Transfer by a Person for whom the
Transferee is acting as nominee, trustee or agent, and the Transferee will not
Transfer its Ownership Interest or cause any Ownership Interest to be
Transferred to any Person that the Transferee knows is not a Permitted
Transferee. In connection with any such Transfer by the Transferee, the
Transferee agrees to deliver to the Trustee a certificate substantially in the
form set forth in this Exhibit L to the Agreement (a "Transferor Certificate")
to the effect that such Transferee has no actual knowledge that the Person to
which the Transfer is to be made is not a Permitted Transferee.

            7. The Transferee does not have the intention to impede the
assessment or collection of any tax legally required to be paid with respect to
the Certificate.

            8. The Transferee's taxpayer identification number is .

            9. The Transferee is a U.S. Person as defined in Code Section
7701(a)(30).

            10. The Transferee is aware that the Certificate may be a
"noneconomic residual interest" within the meaning of Treasury regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Code and that the transferor of a noneconomic
residual interest will remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the
income on such residual interest, unless no significant purpose of the transfer
was to impede the assessment or collection of tax.

            11. That the Transferee will not cause income from the Class R
Certificate to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed
base, within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty, of the Transferee
or any other person.

            12. That, if the Transferee is purchasing the Class R Certificate in
a transfer intended to meet the safe harbor provisions of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.860E-1(c), the Transferee has executed and attached Attachment A
hereto.

            13. The Transferee is not an employee benefit plan that is subject
to ERISA or a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or a plan or
arrangement subject to any materially similar provisions of applicable federal,
state or local law, nor are we acting on behalf of such a plan.

Dear Sir/Madam:

      The purpose of this letter agreement is to confirm the terms and
conditions of the Transaction entered into between Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
National Association, as Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2003, among Asset Backed Funding Corporation,
Option One Mortgage Corporation and the Trustee (the ("Pooling and Servicing
Agreement'), and Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation (each a "party" and
together "the parties") on the Trade Date specified below (the "Transaction").

      This letter agreement constitutes a "Confirmation" and the definitions and
provisions contained in the original June 2000 ISDA Definitions (the
"Definitions") as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc., ("ISDA") are incorporated into this Confirmation. This
Confirmation will be governed by and subject to the terms and conditions which
would be applicable if, prior to the Trade Date, the parties had executed and
delivered an ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border), in the form
published by ISDA in 1992 (the "Master Agreement"), with the attached Schedule B
as the Schedule to the Master Agreement and the modifications provided below
(collectively, the "Agreement"). In the event of any inconsistency between the
provisions of the Master Agreement and this Confirmation and the attached
Schedule B, this Confirmation will govern.

1.    This Confirmation evidences a complete binding agreement between the
      parties as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation
      relates. In addition, each party represents to the other party and will be
      deemed to represent to the other party on the date on which it enters into
      a Transaction that (absent a written agreement between the parties that
      expressly imposes affirmative obligations to the contrary for that
      Transaction):

      (i)   Principal. In the case of Party A, it is acting as principal and not
            as agent when entering into the Transaction and in the case of Party
            B, it is acting as Trustee when entering into the Transaction.

      (ii)  Non-Reliance. In the case of Party A, it is acting for its own
            account and, in the case of Party B, it is acting as Trustee, and in
            the case of both parties, it has made its own independent decisions
            to enter into that Transaction and as to whether that Transaction is
            appropriate or proper for it based upon its own judgment and upon
            advice from such advisors as it has deemed necessary. It is not
            relying on any communication (written or oral) of the other party as
            investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into that
            Transaction; it being understood that information and explanations
            related to the terms and conditions of a Transaction shall not be
            considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter into that
            Transaction. No communication (written or oral) received from the
            other party shall be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee as to
            the expected results of that Transaction.

      (iii) Evaluation and Understanding. It is capable of evaluating and
            understanding (on its own behalf or through independent professional
            advice), and understands and accepts, the terms, conditions and
            risks of the Master Agreement and that Transaction. It is also
            capable of assuming, and assumes, the financial and other risks of
            the Master Agreement and that Transaction.

      (iv)  Status of Parties. The other party is not acting as an agent,
            fiduciary or advisor for it in respect of that Transaction.

In this Confirmation "Party A" means Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation and
"Party B" means Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, not

      Section 5(a)(vi): None.
      Section 5(a)(vii): None.
      Section 5(b)(iv): None.

      will be inapplicable to Party A and Party B.

(d)   The "Credit Support Default" provisions of Section 5(a)(iii) of the
      Agreement will be inapplicable to Party B.

      the date upon which the Non-defaulting Party first becomes aware that such
      Event of Default has occurred under Section 6(a), then (i) the amount of
      such loss or damage shall be added to the amount due by the Defaulting
      Party or deducted from the amount due by the Non-defaulting Party, as the
      case may be (in both cases pursuant to Section 6(e)(i)(3)); or (ii) the
      amount of such gain shall be deducted from the amount due by the
      Defaulting Party or added to the amount due by the Non-defaulting Party,
      as the case may be (in both cases pursuant to Section 6(e)(i)(3)).

(j)   Payments on Early Termination. For the purpose of Section 6(e) of the
      Agreement:

      (i)  Market Quotation will apply; and
      (ii) The Second Method will apply.

      confirmation.

      to its legal or commercial position.

      Payee Representations. For the purpose of Section 3(f) of this Agreement,

(m)   Rating Agency Downgrade

      If a Ratings Event (as defined below) occurs with respect to Party A (or
      any applicable credit support provider), then Party A shall at its own
      expense, (i) assign this Transaction hereunder to a third party
      satisfactory to the Trustee within (30) days of such Ratings Event that
      meets or exceeds, or as to which any applicable credit support provider
      meets or exceeds, the Approved Ratings Thresholds (as defined below) on
      terms substantially similar to this Confirmation or (ii) deliver
      collateral, in an amount equal to the Exposure (as defined below), and an
      executed ISDA Credit Support Annex satisfactory to the Trustee within (30)
      days of such Ratings Event and subject to Moody's, S&P's and Fitch's
      written confirmation that delivery of such collateral in the context of
      such downgrade will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade
      of the then current ratings assigned to the Securities. For avoidance of
      doubt, a downgrade of the rating on the Securities could occur in the
      event that Party A does not post sufficient collateral. For purposes of

      referred to herein as the "Approved Ratings Thresholds," (unless, within
      30 days thereafter, each of Moody's, Fitch and S&P has reconfirmed the
      ratings of the Securities, as applicable, which was in effect immediately
      prior thereto). Only with respect to such Ratings Event, "Exposure" shall
      mean the greater of the following: (i) the mark-to-market value of the
      Transaction as of the Valuation Date (as such term is defined in the ISDA
      Credit Support Annex); (ii) the amount of the next payment due under the
      Transaction and (iii) one percent of the Notional Amount for the
      respective Calculation Period.

(n)   Additional Termination Events

      Additional Termination Events will apply if a Ratings Event has occurred
      and Party A has not complied with (m) above, then an Additional
      Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to Party A and Party A
      shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such and Additional
      Termination Event.

(o)   Amendment to ISDA Form.

      The "Failure to Pay or Deliver" provision in Section 5(a)(i) of the
      Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the word "third" in the third line
      thereof and inserting the word "first" in place thereof.

                                    GUARANTY
                                    --------

      The undersigned, SWISS REINSURANCE COMPANY, a Swiss company (the
"Guarantor"), hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties the
prompt payment upon first demand if and when due of all present and future
obligations of its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary SWISS RE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("THE GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY") including,
without limitation, any obligation in any capacity under, in connection with or
ancillary to, contracts of insurance or reinsurance, contracts for borrowed
money and other evidences of indebtedness of any party, however characterized,
securities transactions, derivative, securitization and alternative risk
transfer transactions, any obligation in the nature of credit extension, credit
enhancement or contractual support, and any obligation relating to transactions
governed by ISDA Master Agreements entered into from time to time by THE
GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY.

      This Guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of
collection and is not conditional or contingent upon any attempts to collect
from, or pursue or exhaust any rights or remedies against, THE GUARANTEED
SUBSIDIARY. A demand for payment hereunder may be made in writing addressed to
the Chief Financial Officer of the Guarantor.

      Notwithstanding any reference to any obligation of THE GUARANTEED
SUBSIDIARY, the Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are its absolute and
independent obligations as a primary obligor and are in particular not dependent
in any way on the validity or enforceability of and are not subject to any
defense or excuse otherwise available under the guaranteed obligations of THE
GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY. However, no payment hereunder shall be required unless
the guaranteed obligations are due and payable in accordance with their terms.
The Guaranty thereby constitutes and is intended by the Guarantor to constitute
an unlimited, non-accessory undertaking ("unbeschrankte, nicht akzessorische
Verpflichtung") within the meaning of Art. 111 of the Swiss Code of Obligations
("CO") and not a mere surety ("Burgschaft") within the meaning of Art. 492 et
seq. CO.

      Upon payment by the Guarantor to any beneficiary of the amount due under
the Guaranty, the Guarantor shall be entitled to require the assignment to it of
the rights of the beneficiary against THE GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY to the extent
satisfied by such payment, and the beneficiary will take at the Guarantor's
expense such steps as the Guarantor may reasonably require to implement such
assignment. The Guarantor shall not exercise any rights against THE GUARANTEED
SUBSIDIARY which it may acquire in consequence of such payment or assignment
unless and until all the obligations of THE GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY to such
beneficiary shall have been paid in full.

      The Guarantor, and the signatories hereto acting jointly, hereby (i)
authorize THE GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY to deliver copies of this Guaranty, and to
conclusively confirm its applicability to any transaction or obligation, to such
persons as it deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, any
counterparty to any transaction and any rating agency engaged in providing a
rating of THE GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY or any of its obligations or of any product
offered or in any manner contractually supported by THE GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY.

      This Guaranty is governed and will be construed in accordance with Swiss
law. Exclusive place of jurisdiction for any legal proceeding hereunder shall be
Zurich, Switzerland.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed in its
name this 10th day of April, 2003.
