ITEM 4.01         CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.

         Effective  as of  December  30,  2004,  BDO  Seidman,  LLP  ("BDO") has
resigned  as  the  independent   public   accountants   for  Brilliant   Digital
Entertainment, Inc. (the "Company").

         In addition,  the Company's Board of Directors,  upon recommendation of
the  Audit  Committee,  has  resolved  to engage  Vasquez  & Company  LLP as the
Company's  new  independent   accountants  to  audit  the  Company's   financial
statements  for the fiscal year ended  December  31,  2004.  The  engagement  of
Vasquez & Company LLP took effect on December 30, 2004.

         BDO's reports on the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements for
either of the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, did not contain
an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion,  and were not qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

         During the two fiscal  years  ended  December  31, 2003 and through the
date of BDO's resignation, there were no disagreements with BDO on any matter of
accounting principles or practices,  financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or  procedure  which,  if not resolved to BDO's  satisfaction,  would have
caused  it to make  reference  to the  subject  matter of the  disagreements  in
connection with its report on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

         The Company has requested BDO furnish the Company a letter addressed to
the Securities and Exchange  Commission stating whether it agrees with the above
statements.  A copy of that  letter  dated  December  30,  2004,  is filed as an
Exhibit to this Form 8-K.


ITEM 5.02         DEPARTURE  OF DIRECTORS  OR  PRINCIPAL  OFFICERS;  ELECTION OF
                  DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.

         Tyler  Tarr,  the  Company's  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  principal
financial and  accounting  officer,  has resigned  from all  positions  with the
Company, effective December 31, 2004.
