<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>LAKES ENTERTAINMENT, INC. RECEIVES $6 MILLION RELATED TO TRAVELODGE PROPERTY</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Minneapolis, December&nbsp;23, 2004 &#151; Lakes Entertainment, Inc. (Nasdaq &#147;LACO&#148;)</B>
announced today that it received approximately $6.0&nbsp;million in cash from
Metroflag related to the previously announced sale of the Travelodge property
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Tim Cope, President of Lakes commented, &#147;Receipt of this $6&nbsp;million strengthens
the company&#146;s cash position as we continue to move forward with our various
gaming projects.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Lakes Entertainment, Inc. currently has development and management agreements
with three separate Tribes for one new casino operation in Michigan and two in
California. Lakes also has agreements for the development of an additional
casino on Indian-owned land in California through a joint venture with MRD
Gaming, which is currently being disputed by the Tribe. Additionally, the
Company owns approximately 64% of WPT Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq &#147;WPTE&#148;), a
separate publicly held media and entertainment company principally engaged in
the development, production and marketing of gaming themed televised
programming including the World Poker Tour television series, the licensing and
sale of branded products and the sale of corporate sponsorships.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Lakes Entertainment, Inc. common shares are traded on the Nasdaq National
Market under the trading symbol &#147;LACO&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><HR size="1" noshade width="100%" align="left">
<DIV  style="font-size: 8pt">The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a &#147;safe harbor&#148;
for forward-looking statements. Certain information included in this press
release (as well as information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by Lakes Entertainment, Inc.) contains statements
that are forward-looking, such as statements relating to plans for future
expansion and other business development activities as well as other capital
spending, financing sources and the effects of regulation (including gaming and
tax regulation) and competition. Such forward-looking information involves
important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated
results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
Company. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
possible delays in completion of Lakes&#146; casino projects, including various
regulatory approvals and numerous other conditions which must be satisfied
before completion of these projects; possible termination or adverse
modification of management contracts; continued indemnification obligations to
Grand Casinos; highly competitive industry; possible changes in regulations;
reliance on continued positive relationships with Indian tribes and repayment
of amounts owed to Lakes by Indian tribes; possible need for future financing
to meet Lakes&#146; expansion goals; risks of entry into new businesses; reliance on
Lakes&#146; management; and the fact that the WPT shares held by Lakes are currently
not liquid assets, and there is no assurance that Lakes will be able to realize
value from these holdings equal to the current or future market value of WPT
common stock. There are also risks and uncertainties relating to WPT that may
have a material effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations or
the market value of the WPT shares held by the Company, including WPT&#146;s
significant dependence on the Travel Channel as a source of revenue; the
potential that WPT&#146;s television programming will fail to maintain a sufficient
audience; the risk that competitors with greater financial resources or
marketplace presence might develop television programming that would directly
compete with WPT&#146;s television programming; the risk that WPT may not be able to
protect its entertainment concepts, current and future brands and other
intellectual property rights; risks associated with future expansion into new
or complementary businesses; the termination or impairment of WPT&#146;s
relationships with key licensing and strategic partners; and WPT&#146;s dependence
on its senior management team. For more information, review the Company&#146;s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
