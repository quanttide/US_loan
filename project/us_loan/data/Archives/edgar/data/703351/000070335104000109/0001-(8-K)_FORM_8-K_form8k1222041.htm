<p><b>Item 1.02.&nbsp; Termination of a
Material Definitive Agreement</b></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brinker International, Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) will
exercise its right to redeem all $431,640,000 principal amount at maturity of
its outstanding zero coupon convertible senior debentures due 2021 at the price
of $633.54 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the debentures.&nbsp; The redemption date is expected to be
January 24, 2005.&nbsp; Under the indenture
governing the debentures, debenture holders will have the right to convert each
$1,000 principal amount at maturity of debentures into 18.08 shares of the Company's
common stock at any time beginning December 23, 2004, until the close of
business on January 20, 2005.&nbsp; Upon
completion of the redemption, the debentures will cease to be issued and
outstanding and the Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2001, between the
Company and SunTrust Bank, as Trustee, will terminate and have no further force
and effect.&nbsp; The Company will not incur
any early termination penalties relating to the redemption of the debentures
and termination of the Indenture.</p>



<p><b>Section 2 - </b></p>

<p><b>Item 2.02.&nbsp; Results of Operations
and Financial Condition</b></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 22, 2004, the Company issued a press
release regarding the matters discussed under Item 4.02 below, which include
adjustments to previously issued financial statements.&nbsp; The press release is attached as Exhibit 99
hereto.</p>



<p><b>Section 4 - </b> </p>

<p><b>Item 4.02.&nbsp;
Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related
Audit Report or Completed Interim Review</b></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; This
filing describes certain corrections which the Company will be making in the
course of restating certain of its prior period financial statements.&nbsp; The Company is unaware of any evidence that
the restatement is due to any material noncompliance by the Company, as a
result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the
securities laws.&nbsp; In addition, the
corrections described in this filing will have no impact on the Company's cash
flow, revenue, same store sales, or covenants under its credit facility or
other debt instruments.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following a review of its accounting policy and in
consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP,
the Company has determined that it had incorrectly calculated its straight-line
rent expense and related deferred rent liability and has modified its
computation to correct this issue.&nbsp; As a
result, on December 21, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors concluded that the Company's previously filed financial statements
should be restated.&nbsp; This move is
similar to recent restatements announced by other KPMG client restaurant companies.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, when accounting for leases with
renewal options, rent expense has been recorded on a straight-line basis over
the initial non-cancelable lease term.&nbsp;
Buildings and leasehold improvements on those properties are depreciated
over a period equal to the shorter of the term of the lease - including option
periods provided for in the lease - or the useful life of the assets.&nbsp; The Company will recognize rent expense on a
straight-line basis over sufficient renewal periods to equal the depreciable
life of 20 years, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise
such options would result in an economic penalty.</p>



<hr><P STYLE="page-break-after: always"></P>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company also evaluated the accounting of an
intangible asset related to franchise rights acquired in fiscal 1998 and has
determined that it would have been more appropriate to expense the purchase
price of the franchise rights.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the above items, the Company will
restate its financial statements through the first quarter of fiscal 2005.&nbsp; The Company estimates that the cumulative
effect of the restatement through fiscal 2004 will be an increase in the
deferred rent liability of approximately $20.7 million and a decrease in
intangible franchise rights of $4.4 million.&nbsp;
In addition, the deferred income tax liability at the end of fiscal 2004
will decrease by approximately $9.4 million, and retained earnings at the end
of fiscal 2004 will decrease by approximately $15.7 million.&nbsp; Rent expense for fiscal years ended 2002,
2003 and 2004 will increase by approximately $3.3 million, $3.9 million and
$4.9 million, respectively, and for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 by
approximately $1.3 million.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restatement will decrease diluted net earnings
per share by approximately $0.02, $0.02 and $0.03 for the fiscal years ended
2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and approximately $0.01 for the first
quarter of fiscal 2005.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These estimates are subject to change as the
Company's independent registered public accounting firm completes its
review.&nbsp; The Company will amend the
appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) to
include the restated financial statements.&nbsp;
As a result of the restatement, the financial statements contained in
the Company's prior filings with the SEC should no longer be relied upon.</p>



<p><b>Section 8 - Other Events</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;Item 8.01.&nbsp; Other
Events.</b></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 22, 2004, the Company issued a press
release announcing that it has resolved its previously disclosed dispute with
the Internal Revenue Service concerning the Tip Reporting Alternative
Commitment (TRAC) agreement.&nbsp; The
Company paid an assessment of $17.3 million in December 2004 for employer-only
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes on unreported cash tips for
calendar years 2000 through 2002.&nbsp; The
Company will record the $17.3 million payment in restaurant expenses in the
second quarter of fiscal 2005 and expects to record an income tax benefit of
approximately $16.9 million, consisting primarily of federal income tax credits
related to excess FICA taxes.&nbsp; This will
result in a negative impact on net income of approximately $400,000 in the
second quarter of fiscal 2005.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company stated that due to the IRS' current
interpretation of the TRAC program, it will not seek to reinstate the
agreement.&nbsp; The press release regarding
this matter is attached as Exhibit 99 hereto.</p>
