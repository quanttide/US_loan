<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Dear Armando:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 6%">This letter agreement (this &#147;Separation Agreement&#148;) sets forth the agreement between you and
Conexant Systems, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) with respect to your resignation (i)&nbsp;as Chief Executive
Officer of the Company effective as of the date set forth on the first page of this Separation

entered into as of January&nbsp;15, 2004 between you and the Company (the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;), your
resignation will be treated in the same manner as a termination pursuant to Section 9(d) of the
Employment Agreement (as amended pursuant to paragraph 3 below) and the Date of Termination under
the Employment Agreement will be the Effective Date. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Employment Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">1.&nbsp;<U>Continuation Period</U>. You hereby acknowledge your resignation (a)&nbsp;as Chief
Executive Officer of the Company effective as of the Effective Date and (b)&nbsp;as a Director of the
Company and a member of the Investment Committee effective as of November&nbsp;12, 2004, and you hereby
resign from any other offices and directorships held with the Company&#146;s subsidiaries and affiliates
(collectively, the &#147;Resignations&#148;). You will no longer possess the powers, duties and
responsibilities (x)&nbsp;of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company from and after the Effective
Date or (y)&nbsp;of a Director of the Company or a member of the Investment Committee from and after
November&nbsp;12, 2004. During the Continuation Period (as defined below), you will be placed on salary
continuation and will continue to be an employee of the Company, but you will not be an executive
officer and will have no authority to, and will not, represent, act for, bind, or commit the
Company in any manner whatsoever. During the Continuation Period, you will continue to make
yourself available to provide services to the Company from time to time at such times and upon such
terms and conditions as the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer shall reasonably request.

Insider Trading Policy); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that you acknowledge and agree that
during the Continuation Period you will be subject to and will comply with the Insider Trading
Policy to the extent that you are in possession of Material Nonpublic Information (as defined in
the Insider Trading Policy) regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">For purposes of this Separation Agreement, &#147;Continuation Period&#148; shall mean the period

the Executive (or the Executive&#146;s legal representative or estate, in the event of the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 6%">(b)&nbsp;The second sentence of Section 10(a) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended to read

information, customer preferences, product and supply costs, financial information, trade secrets,
and other intellectual property, in each case belonging to the Company and/or its related entities
(except that information that is readily available in the public domain will not be considered to

the Company and its business, and the need for the Company to keep such information confidential.
Consequently, you agree to hold in the strictest of confidence, and not to use, reproduce, or
otherwise disclose to any third party, such Confidential Information as long as such information
remains proprietary and/or confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will be permitted to
disclose any Confidential Information to the extent required by a validly issued legal process or
court order, provided that you notify the Company immediately of any such legal process or court
order in an effort to allow the Company to challenge such legal process or court order, if the
Company so elects, prior to your disclosure of any Confidential Information.

respects in connection with the conduct of any pending or future action, proceeding, internal
investigation, governmental or regulatory investigation, civil or administrative proceeding,
arbitration, or litigation involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates,
including, without limitation, any such action, proceeding, investigation, arbitration, or
litigation in which you are called to testify, and will promptly respond to all reasonable requests
by the Company relating to information that may be in your possession. This obligation shall exist
regardless of whether the Company is named as a party or as a subject or target of any action,
proceeding, investigation, arbitration, or litigation. You will perform all acts and execute and
deliver all documents that may be reasonably necessary to fulfill the obligations created by this
paragraph 4(b). The Company will promptly reimburse you for any reasonable out-of-pocket and
travel expenses incurred by you in connection with your fulfillment of your obligations under this
paragraph 4(b), provided that such expenses have been approved by the Company, in writing, prior to
your incurring the expense.

that, in addition to its obligations under this Separation Agreement, it is bound by and subject to
the covenants set forth in Sections&nbsp;9(d), 11 and 12 of the Employment Agreement.
