Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

     On December 17, 2004 the Company entered into and closed an agreement with
Measurement Incorporated ("MI") pursuant to which, as a part of the Company's
plan of liquidation, the Company sold its interest in VSC Technologies, LLC in
exchange for a cash payment of $250,000 and MI agreed to indemnify and hold the
Company harmless with respect to all claims, expenses and damages arising out of
the patent infringement lawsuit involving NCS Pearson, described below.

     Sale of Interest; Termination of Agreements. The Company sold to MI all of
its 50% membership interest in VSC Technologies, LLC. This resulted in MI owning
all of VSC Technologies, LLC. The Company did not retain any rights therein. As
part of this transaction, all of the existing agreements between the Company and
VSC Technologies, LLC or MI were terminated and any obligation of the Company to
repay $350,000 in development cost was also terminated. PIC Acquisition, Inc.
("Pegasus") in connection with acquiring the Company's Component Product
Technology business described in Item 2.01 below entered into new licensing
agreements and maintenance support agreements with MI and VSC Technologies, LLC
to replace those terminated.

     Indemnification. The Company is a party to a lawsuit involving the Virtual
Scoring Center technology we transferred to VSC Technologies, LLC when it was
formed. We do not believe the Virtual Scoring Center technology infringes any
patents or rights of NCS Pearson, Inc. and were designed to avoid any such
infringement. Nonetheless, NCS has alleged that certain aspects of the Virtual
Scoring Center technology infringes on certain patent rights of NCS Pearson,
which we have and continue to deny. There is currently pending in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina a lawsuit
involving these allegations to which MI, VSC Technologies, LLC and the Company
are parties. MI agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless for any costs,
expenses or damages related to this suit.

     Cooperation and Coordination. The Company has agreed with MI that it will
continue to have a coordinator to assist MI in the ongoing discovery and defense
of the lawsuit with NCS Pearson. In this regard, Deborah D. Mosier, the
President and Chief Financial Officer, will continue on a consulting basis to
coordinate on behalf of the Company during its winding-up in assembling and
organizing documents, responding to discovery request and identifying witnesses,
among other things.

Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

     At a special meeting held on December 17, 2004, our shareholders approved
the sale of the assets of our Component Product Technology division to PIC
Acquisition, Inc. ("Pegasus"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pegasus Imaging
Corporation, and a plan of liquidation and dissolution of the Company. We also
completed the final closing of the transaction with Pegasus and the sale of our
membership interest in VSC Technologies, LLC to Measurement Incorporated on
December 17, 2004.

     The final cash price paid at closing for the sale of the Component Products
Technologies business to Pegasus approximated $2,246,000, of which $1,600,000
was paid in cash, $341,000 was issued as a note receivable from Pegasus, and
$305,000 had been used to satisfy professional fees and other corporate costs
that had been incurred related to the sale of our assets and the plan of
liquidation and dissolution of the Company. In addition, Pegasus assumed certain
contractual obligations of the Company, including its office leases, customer
contracts and severance arrangements with certain employees. Upon closing the
sale of VSC Technologies, LLC to Measurement Incorporated, we received $250,000
in cash. We will use the proceeds from both transactions to make a final cash
distribution to shareholders and cover the additional costs associated with the
liquidation and dissolution of the Company.

     The Company has changed it principal executive offices to:

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements

     (1)  Pro forma cash at August 31, 2004 is comprised of the following:

         Proceeds from sale of assets to Pegasus                  $   1,905,195
         Proceeds from sale of LLC interest to MI                       250,000
                                                                 ---------------
                                                                      2,155,195

         Cash paid for directors and officers discovery policy          (99,996)
         Cash paid for key employee severance                           (75,000)
         Cash received from LLC for development costs                    42,835
                                                                 ---------------
                                                                  $   2,023,034
                                                                 ===============

     (2)  The total cash price for the sale of assets to Pegasus was $2,246,149
          of which $340,749 was issued as a note receivable bearing interest at
          an annual rate of 5.25%. The note must be payable within 15 days after
          the date of liquidation, with such liquidation date being set by the
          Company in its sole and absolute discretion after January 31, 2005, or
          by August 15, 2005, whichever is earlier. The pro forma statement of
          operations assumes a full year of interest income under the note from
          Pegasus and accordingly includes an adjustment to interest income of
          $17,850.

     (3)  As a condition to closing the sale of our interest in the LLC to MI,
          all software development costs were required to be paid. Accordingly,
          such payment is included in the pro forma cash balance at August 31,
          2004.

     (4)  The pro forma prepaid expense balance at August 31, 2004 represents a
          three year directors and officers discovery insurance policy. The pro
          forma statement of operations includes an adjustment for 12 months of
          amortization, or $33,332, related to the insurance policy.

     (5)  Interest income includes a pro forma adjustment of $30,000 to reflect
          earnings on an expected average cash balance of $2,000,000 during the
          12 months following the sales transactions at an estimated yield of
          1.5%.

     (6)  We estimate that professional fees, income taxes and other corporate
          costs related to the sale of our assets, implementation of the plan of
          liquidation and limited administrative activities for winding up the
          affairs of the Company will approximate $415,000, of which $32,975 was
          accrued at August 31, 2004. As discussed in Note 1, the pro forma
          financial statements include a cash adjustment of $174,996 for
          directors and officers insurance and key employee severance. An
          additional pro forma adjustment was made to current liabilities and
          accumulated deficit to reflect $176,589 and $20,000 of the remaining
          professional fees or corporate costs and alternative minimum taxes
          ultimately expected to be incurred and paid, respectively.

          In the pro forma statement of operations, which has been prepared as
          if the transactions with Pegasus and MI occurred at the beginning of
          the year, $210,000 of the $415,000 in estimated total costs has been
          excluded from the pro forma results because those costs are for
          employee severance, completion of purchase and sale agreements, proxy
          preparation and solicitation and other costs that are non-recurring in
          nature. The remaining $205,000 of the total costs represents an
          estimate for recurring items such as officers and directors
          compensation, insurance and professional fees related to SEC
          compliance and other administrative matters. Accordingly, a pro forma
          adjustment of $83,332 was made to general and administrative expense
          to give effect to the portion of the remaining $205,000 of estimated
          recurring costs that are expected to be incurred during the first 12
          months following completion of the sales transactions.


     (7)  Except for the pro forma adjustments discussed in Notes 1 - 6 above,
          all remaining assets, liabilities and associated revenue and expenses
          were included in the asset sales to Pegasus or MI and had those sales
          taken place as of and for the year ended August 31, 2004, the Company
          would have recognized a gain of $712,662. The effect of such gain is
          included in the pro forma adjustment to accumulated deficit, but
          excluded from the pro forma statement of operations because it is
          nonrecurring in nature. We expect to use a portion of our $2.7 million
          in tax operating loss carryforwards to offset any gains associated
          with the sales.

     (8)  The loss on the sale of property relates to the sale of the Company's
          headquarters building to a third party other than Pegasus or MI. The
          pro forma statement of operations assumes that such transaction
          occurred as of the beginning of the year and such amount is not
          included in the pro forma financial results as the loss is
          nonrecurring in nature.
