Item 2.05      Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
Item 2.06      Material Impairments.

     As previously  reported,  the registrant has for some time been  evaluating
the  strategic  role of its Thomas Regout  operations  in Europe,  including the
possible sale of some or all of such  operations.  As of December 22, 2004,  the
registrant's  board of  directors  committed to a formal plan to dispose of such
operations.  As a result,  the  registrant  anticipates it will incur a non-cash
charge of approximately $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2004,  representing
an impairment of goodwill  associated  with such  operations,  to write-down its
investment in these operations to its estimated realizable value. The registrant
currently expects to close the sale of the operations in 2005.

     As  provided  by the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995, the  registrant  cautions that the statements in
this  Current  Report on Form 8-K  relating to matters  that are not  historical
facts are  forward-looking  statements that represent  management's  beliefs and
assumptions based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements
can be  identified  by the use of words such as  "believes,"  "intends,"  "may,"
"should," "anticipates," "expects" or comparable terminology,  or by discussions
of strategies or trends.  Although the registrant believes that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking  statements are reasonable, it cannot give any
assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct.  Such statements by
their  nature   involve   substantial   risks  and   uncertainties   that  could
significantly  impact expected  results,  and actual future results could differ
materially from those described in such  forward-looking  statements.  Among the
factors  that could cause actual  future  results to differ  materially  are the
risks and  uncertainties  discussed in this Current  Report and those  described
from time to time in the registrant's other filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, including but not limited to:

     o    the  inability of the  registrant to come to an agreement on the terms
          of the sale of the Thomas Regout operations; and

     o    the inability of a purchaser to obtain the necessary funds to purchase
          the Thomas Regout operations.

Should one or more of these risks  materialize  (or the  consequences  of such a
development worsen) or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual
results  could  differ  materially  from  those  forecasted  or  expected.   The
registrant  disclaims any  intention or obligation to update  publicly or revise
such  statements  whether  as a result  of new  information,  future  events  or
otherwise.
