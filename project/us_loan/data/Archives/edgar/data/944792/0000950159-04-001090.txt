Item 4.  Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.


(a) Changing Accountants

          (i) On December 16, 2004, United Bancshares, Inc. ("UBS") dismissed
     Grant Thornton, LLP as its independent registered public accounting firm
     and retained McGladrey & Pullen, LLP ("McGladrey & Pullen"), Certified
     Public Accounts, as its new independent registered public accounting firm
     on December 16, 2004 to audit UBS' financial statements. The decision to
     change independent accountants was made by the Audit Committee of UBS'
     Board of Directors, because of the costs savings, which will be realized by
     appointing McGladrey & Pullen as its independent accountants to audit UBS'
     financial statements.

          (ii) The independent registered public accounting firm report issued
     by Grant Thornton, LLP on the financial statements of UBS for the two years
     ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or a
     disclaimer of opinion, nor were they modified as to uncertainty, audit
     scope or accounting principles, except that its report on UBS's financial
     statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, contained an explanatory
     paragraph indicating that substantial doubt exists about UBS's ability to
     continue as a going concern.

          (iii) The decision to change independent public accountants was made
     by the Audit Committee of UBS' Board of Directors on December 16, 2004.

          (iv) During each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003
     and subsequent interim periods through December 16, 2004, there were no
     disagreements between UBS and Grant Thornton, LLP on any matter of
     accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
     auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the
     satisfaction of Grant Thornton, LLP would have caused it to make reference
     to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its
     reports; and there were no "reportable events" as that term is used in Item
     304 (a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K occurring within UBS two (2) most recent
     fiscal years and the subsequent interim periods through December 16, 2004,

          (v) UBS has provided Grant Thornton, LLP with a copy of the foregoing
     disclosures and has requested that Grant Thornton, LLP review such
     disclosures and furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange
     Commission stating whether Grant Thornton, LLP agree with such statements.
     A copy of Grant Thornton, LLP's letter response to such request is attached
     hereto as Exhibit 16.

(b) New independent accountants

     UBS engaged McGladrey & Pullen as its new independent registered public
accountants to audit UBS' financial statements as of December 16, 2004, for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and until a new independent registered
public accounting firm is appointed by UBS' Board of Directors. During the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and subsequent interim periods
through December 16, 2004, neither UBS or any one on UBS' behalf has consulted
with McGladrey & Pullen regarding (i) the application of accounting principles
to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit
opinion that might be rendered on UBS' financial statement, or (ii) any matter
that was either the subject of a disagreement as that term is used in Item 304
(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of
Regulation S-K.
