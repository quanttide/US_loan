<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>AAMES
INVESTMENT CORPORATION</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Declares Initial Common Stock Dividend of $0.06 per share</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Los Angeles, California,
December 21, 2004 &#150; Aames Investment Corporation (NYSE: AIC)</B>, a
mortgage real estate investment trust, today announced that its Board of
Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share for the period from
November 5, 2004, the date of Aames initial public offering, to year-end. The
dividend is payable on January 31, 2005, to shareholders of record as of
December 31, 2004. The ex-dividend date is December 29, 2004. New shareholders
interested in receiving this dividend must purchase common stock on or before
December 28, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The initial dividend represents
the distribution of more than 90% of the estimated taxable earnings for the period
from the Company&#146;s reorganization and initial public offering on November
5, 2004 through year-end, exclusive of any net income earned by its taxable REIT
subsidiary, Aames Financial Corporation, during the period, and therefore is not
expected to be a return of capital. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We are very pleased
to declare our first dividend as a REIT,&#148; stated A. Jay Meyerson, Aames
Investment&#146;s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
&#147;However, our initial dividend is reflective of the fact that we completed
our initial public offering and began building our loan portfolio in early
November,&#148; Mr. Meyerson explained. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company expects to
declare its first full regular quarterly dividend after the end of the first
quarter ended March 31, 2005. </FONT></P>
