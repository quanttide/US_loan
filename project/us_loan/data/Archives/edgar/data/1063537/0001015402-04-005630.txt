SECTION 3 - SECURITIES AND TRADING MARKETS

ITEM 3.02   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

On  December 22, 2004 Nutracea (the "Company") closed a $2.4 million bridge loan
private  placement to three accredited investors. The loan is secured, has a one
year  term  and  bears  interest  of  7%  per  annum,  accruing  until  paid. In
conjunction  with  the  loan,  the  investors were issued warrants to purchase a
total  of  2,400,000  shares  of Nutracea's common stock at an exercise price of
$0.30  per  share.  The warrants are immediately exercisable and expire in seven
years  from  the  date  of  issuance.  The  issuance of the promissory notes and
warrants were made in reliance upon the exemption from registration set forth in
Section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") as a transaction not
involving  a  public  offering  and made to accredited investors. The promissory
notes  and warrants were deemed to be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule
144  under  the  1933  Act.
