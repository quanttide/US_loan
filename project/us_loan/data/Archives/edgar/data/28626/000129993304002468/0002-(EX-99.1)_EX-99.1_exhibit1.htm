<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CHASKA, MN. December&nbsp;28, 2004 &#150; LIFECORE BIOMEDICAL, INC. (NASDAQ: LCBM) </B>announced today that it
has renewed its supply agreement with Alcon, Inc. (NYSE: ACL), a global eye care company with
principal U.S. operations in Fort Worth, Texas. Lifecore supplies hyaluronan to Alcon, the market
leader in ophthalmic products, for use in Viscoat&#174; Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Solution, an aid in
anterior segment surgical procedures including cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL)
implantation. The new agreement extends through December&nbsp;2008 and retains minimum purchase
commitments and other features of the previous agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;Renewal of the agreement continues Lifecore&#146;s 20&nbsp;year relationship with our largest customer and a
leader in the ophthalmic market,&#148; said Lifecore President and CEO, Dennis J. Allingham. &#147;We are
pleased that the renewal term has increased to four years from the customary two years. The
strategic value of this agreement serves as a basis to solidify the projected growth in our
Hyaluronan Division.&#148;
