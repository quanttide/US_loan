ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          ------------------------------------------

     On December 17, 2004, Peoples Community Bancorp, Inc. ("PCB") ,
Peoples Community Bank ("Peoples"), American State Corporation ("ASC")
and American State Bank ("American") entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated December 17, 2004 (the "Agreement"), which sets
forth the terms and conditions under which ASC will merge with and
into Peoples (the "Merger").

     The Agreement provides, among other things, that upon
consummation of the Merger, each outstanding share of Class A and
Class B common stock, no par value, of ASC (the "ASC Common Stock")
(other than shares (i) as to which dissenter's rights have been
asserted and duly perfected in accordance with Indiana law and (ii)
held by ASC (including treasury shares) or PCB or Peoples other than
in a fiduciary capacity) shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without
any action by the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive $4.79 in cash.  In addition, holders of ASC Common Stock shall
have a proportionate interest in funds, if any, remaining in the
escrow account to be established in accordance with a Holdback Escrow
Agreement attached to the Agreement as Exhibit D.  Based on the
outcome of certain specific events as set forth in the Holdback Escrow
Agreement, primarily related to the performance of certain loans or
other assets of ASC, holders of ASC Common Stock may receive up to an
additional $.82 per share.  The Agreement also provides that upon
consummation of the Merger, each share of preferred stock of ASC
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $1,000 in
cash.

     In addition, each director of ASC entered into a Stockholder
Agreement with PCB, pursuant to which each such person agreed, among
other things, to vote his or her shares of ASC Common Stock in favor
of the Agreement at a meeting of stockholders of ASC to be called to
consider and approve the Agreement.

     Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of customary
conditions, including, but not limited to, (a) the approval of the
Agreement by the shareholders of ASC and (b) the receipt of requisite
regulatory approvals by the applicable federal and state regulatory
agencies.

     For additional information, reference is made to the Company's
press release dated December 17, 2004, which is included as Exhibit
99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference thereto.
