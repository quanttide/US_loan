SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK TERMS</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>LEXINGTON, MASS., &#151; December&nbsp;27, 2004 &#150; </B>Segue Software, Inc. (NASDAQ -SCM:
SEGU), a leader in software quality optimization, today announced that its
Board of Directors approved an amendment to certain terms of Segue&#146;s Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock, reducing the dividend payable on its Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock
from 12% per year to 6% per year and extending the redemption date of its
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock to October&nbsp;31, 2005. The amendment to the terms of
the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock is subject to approval by Segue&#146;s stockholders at
their next annual meeting, which is expected to be held in June&nbsp;2005. The
holder of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, S-7 Associates LLC, a company managed
and owned by Dr.&nbsp;James Simons, Segue&#146;s chairman, has agreed to vote in favor of
the amendment. Dr.&nbsp;Simons has also agreed to all his other voting shares of
common stock(?) in favor of the proposed amendment. If the amendment is
approved by Segue&#146;s stockholders, Segue expects that the reduced dividend rate
would be in effect prior to the June&nbsp;30, 2005 dividend on the Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We believe this amendment is in the best interests of both our Company and our
stockholders and represents another positive development as we continue our
efforts to build value for all our stakeholders&#148;, commented Joseph Krivickas,
Segue president and chief executive officer. &#147;This amendment, if approved by
stockholders, would, at current prices, have the effect of reducing our
dividend expense by approximately $70,000 per quarter .&#148;
