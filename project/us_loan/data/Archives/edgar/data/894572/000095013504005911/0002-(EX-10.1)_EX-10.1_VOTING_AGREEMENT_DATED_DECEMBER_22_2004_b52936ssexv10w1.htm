fiduciary duties, to submit the Amendment to a vote of the Company&#146;s
stockholders at the Company&#146;s next annual meeting;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, it is a requirement for the adoption of the Amendment that the

Amendment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the Company adopting the Amendment and

consent by such Stockholder, such Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be
voted), or deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be delivered)
covering all of the Shares that such Stockholder shall be entitled to so vote,
whether such Shares are beneficially owned by such Stockholder on the date of
this Agreement or are subsequently acquired, in favor of adoption and approval
of the Amendment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Agreement to Retain Shares. From and after the date hereof until June
