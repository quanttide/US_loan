The Bylaws of Astralis Ltd. (the "Corporation") have been amended as follows:

Section 2.9 of the Bylaws of the Corporation has been deleted and amended in its
entirety to read as follows:

Section 2.9 ACTION WITHOUT MEETING. Any action to be taken at any annual or
special stockholders' meeting may only be taken at such a meeting with prior
notice and with a vote of stockholders. No action may be taken by written
consent or consents signed by the stockholders of the Corporation in lieu of

The following Section 3.13 has been added to the Bylaws of the Corporation:

Section 3.13 APPROVAL OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. Any transaction between the
Corporation and any related party must be approved by a majority of independent
directors. A related party transaction is any transaction between the
Corporation (or any parent or subsidiary of the Corporation) and (i) any
director or executive officer of the Corporation, (ii) any nominee for election
as a director, (iii) any security holder who is known by the Corporation to own
of record or beneficially more than 5% of any class of the Corporation's voting
securities, (iv) any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing
persons or (v) any company, partnership or other entity controlled by or under
common control with any of the above or with respect to which any of the above
is an affiliate. No director is independent unless the board of directors
affirmatively determines that the director has no relationship that would impair
such director's independence. Notwithstanding any determination by the board of
directors, a director is not independent if:

      o     Such director is, or at any time during the past three years was,
            employed by the Corporation or any parent or subsidiary;

      o     Such director accepted, or has a family member who accepted, any
            payments from the Corporation (or any parent or subsidiary) in
            excess of $60,000 during the current or any of the past three fiscal
            years, other than:

            o     director and committee compensation,

            o     payments arising solely from investments in the Corporation's
                  securities,

            o     compensation paid to a family member who is a non-executive
                  employee of the Corporation (or a parent or subsidiary),

            o     benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan or
                  non-discretionary compensation, or

            o     loans permitted under Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange
                  Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act");

      o     Such director is a family member of an individual who is, or at any
            time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the
            Corporation or any parent or subsidiary of the Corporation;

      o     Such director is, or has a family member who is, a partner in, or a
            controlling shareholder or an executive officer of, any organization
            to which the Corporation made, or from whom the Corporation
            received, payments for property or services in the current or any of
            the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient's
            consolidated gross revenues for that year, or $200,000, whichever is
            more;

      o     Such director is, or has a family member who is, an executive
            officer of another entity when at any time during the past three
            years any of the executive officers of the Corporation serve on the
            compensation committee of such other entity;

      o     Such director is, or has a family member who is, a current partner
            of the Corporation's outside auditor, or was a partner or employee
            of the Corporation's outside auditor who worked on the company's
            audit at any time during any of the past three years; and

      o     Such director was nominated or designated directly or indirectly by
            any security holder or affiliate thereof who is known to the
            Corporation to own of record or beneficially more than 5% of any
            class of the Corporation's voting securities or who or which has
            engaged in a related party transaction within the last five years.

The following Section 3.14 has been added to the Bylaws of the Corporation:
