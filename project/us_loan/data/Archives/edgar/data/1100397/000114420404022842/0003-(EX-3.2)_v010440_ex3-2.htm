If a Quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained and the committee cannot be established, or even if a Quorum is obtained or the committee is designated and a majority of the directors constituting such Quorum or committee so directs, the determination shall be made by (i) independent legal counsel selected by a vote of the board of directors or the committee in the manner specified in this Section 4 or, if a Quorum of the full board of directors cannot be obtained and a committee cannot be established, by independent legal counsel selected by a majority vote of the full board (including directors who are parties to the action) or
