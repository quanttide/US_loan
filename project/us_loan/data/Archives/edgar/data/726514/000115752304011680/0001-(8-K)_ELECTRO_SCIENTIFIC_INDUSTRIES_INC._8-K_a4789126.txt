Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

     On December 15, 2004, Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (the "Company")
committed to a restructuring plan to streamline the Company's infrastructure and
improve the Company's ability to respond to the current slowdown in the
Company's industry. The restructuring will reduce the Company's global workforce
by approximately 9 percent, and the Company expects to complete the
restructuring by February 26, 2005.

     The Company expects to incur approximately $1.3 million of costs and cash
expenditures in connection with the restructuring for the third quarter of
fiscal year 2005. The restructuring charges will consist primarily of one-time
termination benefits and related costs.
