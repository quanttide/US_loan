                ESI Announces Fiscal 2005 Second Quarter Results

    PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 22, 2004--Electro Scientific
Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:ESIO) today announced results for its fiscal
2005 second quarter ended November 27, 2004.
    Second quarter sales were $66.0 million, down 9% compared to first
quarter sales of $72.6 million and up 44% compared to prior year
second quarter sales of $45.8 million. Operating income for the
quarter was $9.8 million, compared with operating income of $15.4
million in the first quarter and an operating loss of $3.0 million in
the second quarter a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $7.9
million, or $0.28 per basic and diluted share, compared with net
income of $10.6 million, or $0.38 per basic share and $0.36 per
diluted share in the first quarter and a net loss of $4.9 million, or
$0.17 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter a year ago.
    Included in the second quarter 2005 operating results were charges
of $2.2 million resulting from the settlement and related legal costs
for a patent infringement lawsuit.
    Net orders for the second quarter were $39.8 million, a decrease
of 41% compared with $67.6 million in the first quarter and a decrease
of 39% compared with $64.8 million in the second quarter of 2004.
Backlog decreased $18.3 million to $49.9 million at November 27, 2004
from $68.2 million at August 28, 2004. Deferred revenue decreased this
quarter to $9.4 million compared to $17.2 million at August 28, 2004.
    "We continued to experience a decline in business reflecting the
industry-wide inventory correction," noted Nick Konidaris, ESI's
president and chief executive officer. "The sequential order rate
decreased, with customers in each of our three businesses delaying
equipment purchases during the quarter. Product shipments were
substantially higher than orders as prior backlog shipped during the
quarter."
    Konidaris continued, "Despite ongoing adverse market conditions,
the company performed capably in difficult times. We maintained 50%
gross margins and delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of solid
profitability while increasing our investment in R&D."
    Mike Dodson, ESI's chief financial officer added, "Gross margins
of 50% during the quarter were comparable to 51% in the first quarter.
The slight decrease in gross margins was due to lower overhead
absorption on declining revenues as well as a change in sales mix, but
these factors were largely offset by material cost reductions.
Operating expenses were $23.1 million in the quarter, up from $21.4
million in the first quarter. Excluding the $2.2 million settlement
for patent litigation and related costs charged in the second quarter,
operating expenses were down slightly from the first quarter. The
decrease was primarily due to lower variable selling expenses related
to the decrease in revenues and was partially offset by higher
research and development expenses resulting from additional funding
for new capabilities and initiatives and the timing of project
expenses."
    "Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash and investments were
$338.1 million at the end of the quarter, up $0.9 million from the
first quarter. Cash increased due to operating profits, but was
largely offset by changes in working capital and litigation settlement
payments," concluded Dodson.
    Konidaris added, "Although visibility is limited, the current
industry slowdown could persist for several quarters. Given the high
degree of uncertainty going forward, we have decided to take action
proactively to streamline our infrastructure to increase agility,
scalability and market innovation, while decreasing our break-even
point. As a result, we will be reducing our workforce by approximately
9%. In addition to the restructuring, we have also initiated several
new actions designed to improve the operating efficiency of the
company. These efforts are focused on cycle time reductions, supplier
quality engineering, design for manufacturability, as well as overall
cost control measures throughout the organization. We believe these
actions will make ESI a more nimble company that is better able to
perform well in the months and years ahead."
    Charges relating to the restructuring will approximate $1.3
million and are expected to be incurred in the third quarter. Ongoing
annual savings from these actions are currently estimated to be
approximately $6 million.
    "Now I'd like to turn to Q3 guidance. As a result of the
uncertainty in the industry, our visibility is limited. Based on the
best information available to us at this time, we believe third
quarter shipments and revenues will be in the range of $40 million to
$55 million. Given the expected decrease in revenues, we expect
margins to decrease accordingly as manufacturing costs will not
decrease at the same rate as revenues. As a result, we expect margins
to be in the mid 40% range. Excluding the $1.3 million of
restructuring charges, we expect third quarter operating expenses to
decline to approximately $19 to $20 million due to the previously
mentioned restructuring actions and cost containment measures,"
concluded Konidaris.
    The effective tax rate used in the second quarter to calculate the
tax provision was 17% compared to 29% in the prior quarter. This
decrease results from the necessity to adjust on a quarterly basis the
year-to-date effective tax rate to the company's best estimate of the
annual effective tax rate which is now 25%.
    The company will hold a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern
Time. The session will include a review of the financial results,
operational performance, business outlook, and a question and answer
period.
    The conference call can be accessed by calling 800-374-2470
(domestic participants) or 706-634-5108 (international participants).
A live audio webcast can be accessed at www.esi.com. Upon completion
