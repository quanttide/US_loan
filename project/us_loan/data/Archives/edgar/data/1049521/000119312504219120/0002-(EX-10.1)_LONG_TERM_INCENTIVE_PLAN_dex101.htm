<I>Purpose</I>. This Plan is intended to create incentives for certain executive officers and key employees of the Company to allow the Company to attract and retain in its employ persons who will contribute to the future success of the Company. It
is further the intent of the Company that Awards made under this Plan be used to achieve the twin goals of (i) aligning executive incentive compensation with increases in stockholder value over the long term, and (ii) using equity compensation as a
tool to retain key employees. In furtherance of the second goal, it is the intention of the Company that fifty percent (50%) of each Award made under this Plan will be made in the form of either restricted stock or restricted stock units, with
time-based vesting over a period to be determined by the Committee. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2.
