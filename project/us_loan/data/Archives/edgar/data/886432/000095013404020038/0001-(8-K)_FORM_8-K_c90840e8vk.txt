ITEM 1.02 TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 29, 2004, Health Fitness Corporation ("HFC") repaid its
$2,000,000 Secured Senior Subordinated Note ("Note") that was established
December 8, 2003, and was held by Bayview Capital Partners LP. The repayment was
announced in a press release dated December 29, 2004 and is attached hereto as
Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated in this Current Report as if fully set forth
herein. The Note was repaid using funds from HFC's $6,250,000 Revolving Credit
Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. established on August 22, 2003.

         The Note had an interest rate of 12% per year and was scheduled to
mature on December 8, 2008. In connection with the Note repayment, HFC also paid
a prepayment penalty of $80,000, which represents 4% of the face value of the
