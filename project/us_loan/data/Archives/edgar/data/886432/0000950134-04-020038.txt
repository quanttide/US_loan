HEALTH FITNESS ANNOUNCES REPAYMENT OF SUB-DEBT NOTE

         MINNEAPOLIS, December 29, 2004 --- Health Fitness Corporation ("HFC")
(OTC BB: HFIT) today announced the repayment of its $2,000,000 Secured Senior
Subordinated Note (the "Note") held by Bayview Capital Partners LP ("Bayview").
The Note was repaid using funds from HFC's $6,250,000 Revolving Credit Facility
with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A (the "Wells Loan").

         HFC entered into the Note with Bayview on December 8, 2003, the
proceeds of which were used by HFC to acquire the business assets of the Health
& Fitness Services Business of Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems Inc. The
Note had an interest rate of 12% per year, and was scheduled to mature on
December 8, 2008. In connection with the Note repayment, HFC also paid a
prepayment penalty of $80,000, which represents 4% of the face value of the
Note. In addition, HFC incurred a one-time, non-cash charge to interest expense
of $394,669, representing the unamortized difference between the face value of
the Note and its assigned relative fair value, as well as unamortized financing
costs related to the Note. HFC estimates that this one-time, non-cash charge, in
addition to the prepayment penalty, will decrease 2004 diluted earnings per
share by approximately $0.03.

         The Wells Loan was established on August 22, 2003, to provide HFC with
acquisition financing and general working capital, and will expire on June 30,
2007. At the option of HFC, the Wells Loan bears interest at prime (currently
5.25%), or the one-month LIBOR (currently 2.42%) plus a margin of 2.25%.
Borrowings under the Wells Loan are collateralized by substantially all of HFC's
assets.

         "The prepayment of the Bayview Note before its maturity made good
financial sense," said Wes Winnekins, CFO of HFC. "The $4.8 million we borrowed
during 2004 from the Wells Loan to fund our acquisition costs was repaid during
the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. Since we now have greater borrowing
capacity on our Wells Loan, it made sense to reduce our interest cost from 12%
to approximately 5% per year. Even though we will take a one-time charge to
earnings in 2004, we will save approximately $206,000 of interest costs in 2005,
and a total of $920,000 over the next four years."
