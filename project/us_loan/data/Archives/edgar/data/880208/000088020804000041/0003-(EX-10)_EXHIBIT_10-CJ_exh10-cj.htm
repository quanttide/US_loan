INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of ______________
("<B><I>Agreement</B></I>"), between SBS Technologies, Inc., a New Mexico
corporation (the "<B><I>Corporation</B></I>"), and&nbsp;__________
("<B><I>Indemnitee</B></I>").</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Background Statement and Recitals</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Highly competent and experienced persons are becoming
more reluctant to serve corporations as directors or in other capacities unless
they are provided with adequate protection through insurance and adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them
arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
"<B><I>Board</B></I>") has determined that the inability to attract and retain
such persons would be detrimental to the best interests of the Corporation and
its shareholders and that the Corporation should act to assure such persons that
there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Board has also determined that it is reasonable,
prudent and necessary for the Corporation, in addition to purchasing and
maintaining directors' and officers' liability insurance (or otherwise providing
for adequate arrangements of self-insurance), contractually to obligate itself
to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by current and future
applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Corporation free
from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Indemnitee is willing to serve, to continue to serve and
to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Corporation on the
condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual covenants herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration,
the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby
agree as follows:</P>

control of the Corporation occurring any time after the date hereof of a nature
that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A
of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item on any similar schedule or
form) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"<B><I>Exchange Act</B></I>"), whether or not the Corporation is then subject to
such reporting requirement; <I>provided, however</I>, that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have
occurred (irrespective of the applicability of the initial clause of this
definition) if at any time after the date hereof (a) any "person" (as such term
is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, but excluding (i) any

combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities without
the prior approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the whole Board in
office immediately prior to such person attaining such percentage interest; (b)
the Corporation is a party to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale of
assets or other reorganization, or a proxy contest (a "<B><I>Business
Combination</B></I>"), as a consequence of which (x) members of the Board in
office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a
majority of the whole Board thereafter or (y) all or substantially all of the
individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the Corporation's
then outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such Business
Combination fail to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of
the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors (or similar body) of the entity resulting from such
Business Combination (including without limitation, an entity which as a result
of such transaction owns the Corporation or all or substantially all of the
Corporation's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in
proportions not materially different from their ownership, immediately prior to
such Business Combination, of the Corporation's then outstanding voting
securities; or (c) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who
at the beginning of such period constituted members of the Board (including for
this purpose any new member whose election or nomination for election by the
Corporation's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
members of the whole Board then still in office who were members of the Board at
the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of
the whole Board.</P>

indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the term "<B><I>Independent Counsel</B></I>" shall not include any

related to any such action, suit, arbitration, investigation, hearing or

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE II<BR>
SERVICES BY INDEMNITEE</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 2.1&#9;<I>Services</I>. Indemnitee agrees to
serve, or continue to serve, as a director of the Corporation. Indemnitee may
from time to time also agree to serve, as the Corporation may request from time
to time, as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
employee, agent, fiduciary or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic
corporation, employee benefit plan, other enterprise or other entity. Indemnitee
and the Corporation each acknowledge that they have entered into this Agreement
as a means of inducing Indemnitee to serve, or continue to serve, the
Corporation in such capacities. Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason
resign from such position or positions (subject to any other contractual
obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law). The Corporation shall
have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in any such
position or positions.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE III<BR>
INDEMNIFICATION</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 3.1&#9;<I>General</I>. The Corporation shall
indemnify, and advance Expenses to, Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law in effect on the date hereof and to such greater extent as
applicable law may thereafter from time to time permit. The rights of Indemnitee
provided under the preceding sentence shall include, but shall not be limited
to, the right to be indemnified and to have Expenses advanced in all Proceedings
to the fullest extent permitted by Section 53-11-4.1 of the NMBCA. The
provisions set forth in this Agreement are provided in addition to and as a
means of furtherance and implementation of, and not in limitation of, the
obligations expressed in this Article III. No requirement, condition or
limitation of any right to indemnification under this Article III, or to
advancement of Expenses under Articles III and IV shall in any way limit the
rights of Indemnitee under Section 7.3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 3.2&#9;<I>Additional Indemnity</I> <I>of the
Corporation</I>. Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 3.2 if, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, Indemnitee was,
is or is threatened to be made, a party to any Proceeding (except to the extent
limited by Section 3.3). Pursuant to this Section 3.2, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against reasonable Expenses, judgments, penalties (including excise
or similar taxes), fines and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with any such
Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually
incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with such
Proceeding or any Claim, issue or matter, therein, if (a) Indemnitee acted in
good faith; (b) Indemnitee reasonably believed (i) in the case of conduct in
Indemnitee's official capacity with the Corporation, that Indemnitee's conduct
was in the Corporation's best interest; and (ii) in all other cases, that
Indemnitee's conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and (c) in the case of any criminal Proceeding, Indemnitee had no
reasonable cause to believe Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful. Nothing in this
Section 3.2 shall limit the benefits of Section 3.1 or any other Section
hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 3.3&#9;<I>Limitation on Indemnity</I>. The
indemnification otherwise available to an Indemnitee under Section 3.2 shall be
limited to the extent set forth in this Section 3.3. In the event that an
Indemnitee is found liable to the Corporation or is found liable on the basis
that personal benefit was improperly received by the Indemnitee whether or not
the benefit resulted from an action taken in Indemnitee's official capacity the
Indemnitee shall, with respect to the Claim, issue or matter, in the Proceeding
in which such finding is made, be indemnified only against reasonable Expenses
actually incurred by Indemnitee in connection with that Claim, issue or matter
therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification against such Expenses
shall be made in respect of any Claim, issue or matter, in such Proceeding as to
which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable for willful or
intentional misconduct in the performance of Indemnitee's duty to the
Corporation; <I>provided, however</I>, that, if applicable law so permits,
indemnification against such Expenses shall nevertheless be made by the
Corporation in such event if and only to the extent that the court in which such
Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending, shall determine.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IV<BR>
EXPENSES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 4.1&#9;<I>Expenses of a Party Who Is Wholly
or Partly Successful</I>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary (except as set forth in Section 7.2(c) or 7.7), and without a
requirement for any determination described in Section 5.2, the Corporation
shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred
by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with any Proceeding to
which Indemnitee was or is a party by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status
and in which Indemnitee is wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the
defense of the Proceeding. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful, on the merits
or otherwise, in a Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as
to any Claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding, the Corporation shall
indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf relating to each successfully resolved
Claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this Section 4.1 and without limitation,
the termination of a Claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding by dismissal, with
or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such
Claim, issue or matter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 4.2&#9;<I>Expenses of a Witness or Non-Party</I>.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a witness
or otherwise participates in any Proceeding at a time when Indemnitee is not a
party in the Proceeding, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against all
Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's
behalf in connection therewith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 4.3&#9;<I>Advancement of Expenses</I>. Except as
set forth in Section 5.5, the Corporation shall pay all reasonable Expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding,
whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation or otherwise, in advance
of any determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification pursuant to
Article V within 15<B> </B>days after the receipt by the Corporation of (a) a
written affirmation by the director of Indemnitee's good faith belief that
Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under
Article III and (b) a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay
the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee has
not met that standard and a determination is made pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Article V that the facts then known to those making the determination
would not preclude indemnification under Section 53-11-4.1 of the NMBCA. Such
statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by
Indemnitee. Indemnitee hereby undertakes and agrees that Indemnitee will
reimburse and repay the Corporation for any Expenses so advanced to the extent
that it shall ultimately be determined, in a final adjudication by a court from
which there is no further right of appeal, that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified against such Expenses. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE V<BR>
PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT<BR>
TO INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 5.1&#9;<I>Request by Indemnitee</I>. To
obtain indemnification or an advancement of Expenses under this Agreement,
Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein
or therewith with respect to the request for indemnification only, such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is
reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification. The Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification
or an advancement of Expenses, advise the members of the Board in writing that
Indemnitee has requested indemnification or an advancement of Expenses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 5.2&#9;<I>Determination of Request</I>. Upon
written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.1 or an
advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 4.3, a determination, if required by
applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made
in the specific case as follows: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;If a Change in Control shall have occurred, by
Independent Counsel (selected in accordance with Section 5.3) in a written
opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, unless
Indemnitee shall request that such determination be made by the Board, or a
committee of the Board, in which case by the person or persons or in the manner
provided for in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (b) below;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;If a Change in Control shall not have
occurred, (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board
consisting of Disinterested Directors, or (ii) if a quorum of the Board
consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable, by a majority vote of a
committee of the Board designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of the
entire Board, consisting solely of two or more Disinterested Directors, (iii) by
Independent Counsel selected by the Board or a committee of the Board by a vote
as set forth in clauses (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b), or if such quorum is
not obtainable or such committee cannot be established, by a majority vote of
all directors, or (iv) if Indemnitee and the Corporation agree, by the
shareholders of the Corporation in a vote that excludes the shares held by
directors who are not Disinterested Directors; or </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;As provided in Section 5.4(b). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification or an advancement of Expenses hereunder, payment to Indemnitee
shall be made within 15 days after such determination. Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with
respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification only, including providing
to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any
documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from
disclosure and that is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably
necessary for such determination. Other than a written request and reasonable
support for Expenses incurred, Indemnitee shall not be required to cooperate or
provide any other documentation or information with respect to a request or
determination with respect to the advancement of Expenses. Any costs or expenses
(including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so
cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall
be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the determination as to
Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification), and the Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee therefrom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 5.3&#9;<I>Independent Counsel</I>. If the
determination of entitlement to indemnification or advancement of Expenses is to
be made by Independent Counsel, the Independent Counsel shall be selected (a) by
the Board by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board consisting of
Disinterested Directors, or (b) if a quorum of the Board consisting of
Disinterested Directors is not obtainable, by a majority vote of a committee of
the Board designated to select such Independent Counsel by a majority vote of
all directors of the Corporation, consisting solely of two or more Disinterested
Directors, or (c) if such quorum is not obtainable or such committee cannot be
established, by a majority vote of all directors. The Corporation shall give
written notice to Indemnitee, within 10 days after receipt by the Corporation of
Indemnitee's request for indemnification or advancement of Expenses, specifying
the identity and address of the Independent Counsel so selected and (i) such
notice to Indemnitee shall be accompanied by a written affirmation of the
Independent Counsel so selected that it satisfies the requirements of the
definition of "Independent Counsel" in Article I and that it agrees to serve in
such capacity and (ii) Indemnitee may, within seven days after such written
notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Corporation a written
objection to such selection. Any objection to selection of Independent Counsel
pursuant to this Section 5.3 may be asserted only on the ground that the
Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of the definition
of "Independent Counsel" in Article I hereof, and the objection shall set forth
with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. If such written
objection is timely made, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as
Independent Counsel unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction (the
"<B><I>Court</B></I>") has determined that such objection is without merit. In
the event of a timely written objection to a choice of Independent Counsel, the
Corporation shall have seven days to make an alternate selection of Independent
Counsel and to give written notice of such selection to the Indemnitee, after
which time the Indemnitee shall have five days to make a written objection to
such alternate selection. If, within 30 days after submission of Indemnitee's
request for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof or an advancement of
Expenses pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been
selected and not objected to, the Corporation or the Indemnitee may petition the
Court for resolution of any objection that shall have been made by the
Indemnitee to the Corporation's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the
appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such
other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom
an objection is so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent
Counsel under Section 5.2 hereof. The Corporation shall pay any and all
reasonable fees and expenses incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection
with acting pursuant to Section 5.2, and the Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this Section 5.3,
regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or
appointed. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to Section 6.1, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of
any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards
of professional conduct then prevailing).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 5.4&#9;<I>Presumptions and Effect of Certain
Proceedings.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;The Indemnitee shall be presumed to be
entitled to indemnification and advancement of Expenses under this Agreement
upon submission of a request for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.1 or
advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 4.3, and thereafter the Corporation
shall have the burden of proof in overcoming that presumption in reaching a
determination contrary to that presumption. Such presumption shall be used by
Independent Counsel (or other person or persons determining entitlement to
indemnification or advancement of Expenses) as a basis for a determination of
entitlement to indemnification and advancement of Expenses unless the
Corporation provides information sufficient to overcome such presumption by
clear and convincing evidence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;If the person or persons empowered or selected
under this Article V to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of Expenses shall not have made a determination
within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of Indemnitee's request for
indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, the requisite
determination of entitlement to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as
the case may be, shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be
entitled to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses, absent (i) a
knowing misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or knowing omission of a
material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially
misleading, in connection with Indemnitee's request for indemnification or
advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, or (ii) a prohibition of such
indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, under applicable
law; <I>provided, however</I>, that such 60-day period may be extended for a
reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person making the
determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification only (and not with
respect to the determination of the advancement of Expenses) in good faith
requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation
and/or information relating to such determination; <I>provided further</I>, that
the 60-day limitation set forth in this Section 5.4(b) shall not apply and such
period shall be extended as necessary (i) if within 30 days after receipt by the
Corporation of Indemnitee's request for indemnification under Section 5.1 or
advancement of Expenses under Section 4.3, as the case may be, Indemnitee and
the Corporation have agreed, and the Board has resolved to submit, such
determination to the shareholders of the Corporation pursuant to Section 5.2(b)
for their consideration at an annual meeting of shareholders to be held within
90 days after such agreement and such determination is made thereat, or a
special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of making such determination to
be held within 60 days after such agreement and such determination is made
thereat, or (ii) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification or
advancement of Expenses is to be made by Independent Counsel, in which case the
applicable period shall be as set forth in clause (c) of Section 6.1.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The termination of any Proceeding or of any Claim,
issue or matter by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court
approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) by itself
adversely affect the rights of Indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of
Expenses, as the case may be, or create a presumption that Indemnitee did
conduct himself in good faith or in a manner that Indemnitee reasonably believed
in the case of conduct in Indemnitee's official capacity, that was in the best
interests of the Corporation, or, in all other cases, that was not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal
Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's
conduct was unlawful. Indemnitee shall be deemed to have been found liable in
respect of any Claim, issue or matter only after Indemnitee shall have been so
adjudged by the Court after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 5.5&#9;<I>Election to Assume Defense</I>. In the
event the Corporation shall be obligated to advance the Expenses of any
Proceeding or Claim against the Indemnitee, the Corporation shall be entitled,
in lieu thereof, to assume the defense of such proceeding upon the delivery to
the Indemnitee of written notice of the Corporation's election to do so, which
notice shall contain the name, address and phone number of counsel engaged by
the Corporation to handle such defense and confirmation that the Corporation has
undertaken to pay that counsel's reasonable fees and expenses therefor. After
delivery of such notice, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee
under this Agreement for any fees or expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee
(other than the counsel engaged by the Corporation) subsequently incurred by the
Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding or Claim; provided that the fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the
Corporation if (A) the employment of separate counsel by the Indemnitee has been
previously authorized by the Corporation, or (B) the Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded, and either the Corporation or the counsel engaged by the
Corporation shall have agreed, or Independent Counsel shall have determined,
that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense; and further provided, however,
that, the Indemnitee's counsel shall have been approved by any carrier of an
applicable insurance policy if required under the terms of that policy.
Independent Counsel shall be selected promptly following notice from the
Indemnitee to the Corporation of the Indemnitee's belief that a conflict of
interest may exist. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the Indemnitee to
employ counsel at the Indemnitee's sole expense.</P>

CERTAIN REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 6.1&#9;<I>Indemnitee Entitled to Adjudication
in an Appropriate Court</I>. If (a) a determination is made pursuant to Article
V that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses
under this Agreement, (b) there has been any failure by the Corporation to make
timely payment or advancement of any amounts due hereunder, or (c) the
determination of entitlement to indemnification or advancement of Expenses is to
be made by Independent Counsel and such determination shall not have been made
and delivered in a written opinion within 90 days after the latest of (i) such
Independent Counsel's being appointed, (ii) the overruling by the Court of
objections to such counsel's selection or (iii) expiration of all periods for
the Corporation or Indemnitee to object to such counsel's selection, Indemnitee
shall be entitled to commence an action seeking an adjudication in the Court, of
Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses.
Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee's option, may seek an award in
arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall
commence such action seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within
180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence
such action pursuant to this Section 6.1, or such right shall expire. The
Corporation shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or
award in arbitration, but may oppose Indemnitee's right to indemnification or
payment of expenses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 6.2&#9;<I>Adverse Determination Not to Affect any
Judicial Proceeding</I>. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to
Article V that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of
Expenses under this Agreement, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced
pursuant to this Article VI shall be conducted in all respects as a <I>de
novo</I> trial or arbitration on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be
prejudiced by reason of such initial adverse determination. In any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article VI, Indemnitee
shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses,
as the case may be, under this Agreement and the Corporation shall have the
burden of proof in overcoming such presumption and to show by clear and
convincing evidence that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or
advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 6.3&#9;<I>Corporation Bound by Determination
Favorable to Indemnitee in any Judicial Proceeding or Arbitration</I>. If a
determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to
Article V that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of
Expenses, the Corporation shall be irrevocably bound by such determination in
any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article VI and
shall be precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or
that the procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding
and enforceable, in each such case absent (a) a knowing misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or a knowing omission of a material fact
necessary to make a statement by Indemnitee not materially misleading, in
connection with Indemnitee's request for indemnification or advancement of
Expenses, or (b) a prohibition of such indemnification or advancement of
Expenses under applicable law. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 6.4&#9;<I>Corporation Bound by the Agreement</I>.
The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or
arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article VI that the procedures and
presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall
stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation
is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 6.5&#9;<I>Indemnitee Entitled to Expenses of
Judicial Proceeding</I>. If Indemnitee seeks a judicial adjudication of or an
award in arbitration to enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages
for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the
Corporation, and the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against, any and all
expenses (of the types described in the definition of "Expenses" in Article I)
actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in such judicial adjudication or
arbitration but only if Indemnitee prevails therein. If it shall be determined
in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to
receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses or
other benefit sought, the expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be equitably allocated between
the Corporation and Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in
Control shall have occurred, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification
under this Section 6.5 regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately prevails in
such judicial adjudication or arbitration.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VII<BR>
MISCELLANEOUS</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.1&#9;<I>Non-Exclusivity</I>. The rights of
Indemnitee to receive indemnification and advancement of Expenses under this
Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee
may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws of the Corporation, any other agreement, vote of shareholders or a
resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment or alteration of the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation or any provision thereof
shall adversely affect Indemnitee's rights hereunder and such rights shall be in
addition to any rights Indemnitee may have under the Corporation's Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws and the NMBCA or otherwise. To the extent that there is a
change in the NMBCA or other applicable law (whether by statute or judicial
decision) that allows greater indemnification by agreement than would be
afforded currently under the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Indemnitee
shall enjoy by virtue of this Agreement the greater benefit so afforded by such
change.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.2&#9;<I>Insurance and Subrogation</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;To the extent the Corporation maintains an
insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors,
officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Corporation or for directors
of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as directors,
officers, partners, venturers, proprietors, trustees, employees, agents,
fiduciaries or similar functionaries of another foreign or domestic corporation,
employee benefit plan, other enterprise or other entity that such person serves
at the request of the Corporation, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or
policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the
coverage available for any such director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary
under such policy or policies. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;In the event of any payment by the Corporation
under this Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all
papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including
execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring
suit to enforce such rights.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;The Corporation shall not be liable under this
Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if
and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment
under the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or any insurance
policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.3&#9;<I>Self Insurance; Other Arrangements</I>.
The parties hereto recognize that the Corporation may, but is not required to,
procure or maintain insurance or other arrangements, at its expense, to protect
itself and any person, including Indemnitee, who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or who is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic
corporation, employee benefit plan, other enterprise or other entity against any
expense, liability or loss asserted against or incurred by such person, in such
a capacity or arising out of Indemnitee's status as such a person, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In considering the cost and availability of such
insurance, the Corporation, (through the exercise of the business judgment of
its directors and officers), may from time to time, purchase insurance which
provides for any and all of (a) deductibles, (b) limits on payments required to
be made by the insurer, or (c) coverage exclusions and/or coverage which may not
be as comprehensive as that which might otherwise be available to the
Corporation but which otherwise available insurance the officers or directors of
the Corporation determine is inadvisable for the Corporation to purchase given
the cost involved. The purchase of insurance with deductibles, limits on
payments and coverage exclusions will be deemed to be in the best interest of
the Corporation but may not be in the best interest of the Indemnitee. As to the
Corporation, purchasing insurance with deductibles, limits on payments and
coverage exclusions is similar to the Corporation's practice of self-insurance
in other areas. In order to protect Indemnitee who would otherwise be more fully
or entirely covered under such policies, the Corporation shall indemnify and
hold Indemnitee harmless to the extent (a) of such deductibles, (b) of amounts
exceeding payments required to be made by an insurer or (c) of coverage under
policies of officer's and director's liability insurance that are available,
were available or which became available to the Corporation or which are
generally available to companies comparable to the Corporation but which the
officers or directors of the Corporation determine is inadvisable for the
Corporation to purchase, given the cost involved. The obligation of the
Corporation in the preceding sentence shall be without regard to whether the
Corporation would otherwise be entitled to indemnify such officer or director
under the other provisions of this Agreement, or under any law, agreement, vote
of shareholders or directors or other arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.3, the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to
indemnification for the results of Indemnitee's conduct that is intentionally
adverse to the interests of the Corporation. Without limiting the generality of
any provision of this Agreement, the procedures in Article V hereof shall, to
the extent applicable, be used for determining entitlement to indemnification
under this Section 7.3. This Agreement is authorized by Section 53-11-4.1(J) of
the NMBCA as in effect on the date hereof, and further is intended to establish
an arrangement of self-insurance pursuant to that section.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.4&#9;<I>Certain Settlement Provisions</I>. The
Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify Indemnitee under this
Agreement for amounts paid in settlement of a Proceeding or Claim without the
Corporation's prior written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any
Proceeding or Claim in any manner that would impose a fine or other obligation
on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's prior written consent, unless the settlement
involves only the payment of money damages indemnified by the Corporation and
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnitee.
Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold their consent
to any proposed settlement. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement to indemnify the Indemnitee for liabilities in excess of the total
amount at which settlement reasonably could have been made, or for any Expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee following the time such settlement reasonably could
have been effected, if the Indemnitee shall have unreasonably delayed, refused
or failed to enter into a settlement of any Proceeding or Claim (or
investigation or appeal thereof) recommended in good faith, in writing, by the
Corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.5&#9;<I>Duration of Agreement</I>. This
Agreement shall continue for so long as Indemnitee serves as a director, nominee
for director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation or, at
the request of the Corporation, as a director, nominee for director, officer,
employee, agent or fiduciary of another foreign or domestic corporation,
employee benefit plan, other enterprise or other entity, and thereafter shall
survive until and terminate upon the latest to occur of (a) the expiration of 10
years after the latest date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve in any
such capacity; (b) the final termination of all pending Proceedings in respect
of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of
Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to
Article VI relating thereto; or (c) the expiration of all statutes of limitation
applicable to possible Claims arising out of Indemnitee's Corporate Status.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.6&#9;<I>Notice by Each Party</I>. Indemnitee
shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing upon being served with any
summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other
document or communication relating to any Proceeding or Claim for which
Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses
hereunder; provided, however, that any failure of Indemnitee to so notify the
Corporation shall not adversely affect Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement
except to the extent the Corporation shall have been materially prejudiced as a
direct result of such failure. The Corporation shall notify promptly Indemnitee
in writing, as to the pendency of any Proceeding or Claim that may involve a
claim against the Indemnitee for which Indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.7&#9;<I>Certain Persons Not Entitled to
Indemnification</I>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to (a) indemnification or
advancement of Expenses hereunder with respect to any Proceeding or any Claim,
issue or matter therein, brought or made by Indemnitee against the Corporation
or any affiliate of the Corporation, except as specifically provided in Article
V or Article VI hereof, and (b) indemnification of Expenses hereunder with
respect to any Proceeding or Claim instituted by the Indemnitee to enforce or
interpret this Agreement, if the Corporation is deemed to be the prevailing
party in such Proceeding or Claim. In addition, notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to indemnify the Indemnitee for Expenses
and liabilities, including without limitation the disgorgement of profits,
arising from the purchase and sale by the Indemnitee of securities in violation
of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
similar or successor statute.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.8&#9;<I>Enforcement</I>. The Corporation agrees
that its execution of this Agreement shall constitute a stipulation by which it
shall be irrevocably bound in any court or arbitration in which a proceeding by
Indemnitee for enforcement of Indemnitee's rights hereunder shall have been
commenced, continued or appealed, that its obligations set forth in this
Agreement are unique and special, and that failure of the Corporation to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement will cause irreparable and irremediable
injury to Indemnitee, for which a remedy at law will be inadequate. As a result,
in addition to any other right or remedy Indemnitee may have at law or in equity
with respect to breach of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to
injunctive or mandatory relief directing specific performance by the Corporation
of its obligations under this Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.9&#9;<I>Successors and Assigns</I>. All of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators, legal
representatives.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.10&#9;<I>Amendment</I>. This Agreement may not
be modified or amended except by a written instrument executed by or on behalf
of each of the parties hereto.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.11&#9;<I>Waivers</I>. The observance of any
term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively) by the party entitled to
enforce such term only by a writing signed by the party against which such
waiver is to be asserted. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, no delay
on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of
any party hereto of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.12&#9;<I>Entire Agreement</I>. This Agreement
and the documents expressly referred to herein constitute the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the matters covered hereby, and any
other prior or contemporaneous oral or written understandings or agreements with
respect to the matters covered hereby are expressly superseded by this
Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.13&#9;<I>Severability</I>. If any provision of
this Agreement (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or
sentence) or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance,
shall be judicially declared to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision
will not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement or affect the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent,
or if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another
provision that is valid, legal and unenforceable and that achieves the same
objective. Any such finding of invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent
the enforcement of such provision in any other jurisdiction to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 7.14&#9;<I>Notices</I>. All notices and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon (a)
transmitter's confirmation of a receipt of a facsimile transmission, (b)
confirmed delivery of a standard overnight courier or when delivered by hand or
(c) the expiration of five business days after the date mailed by certified or
registered mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, to the parties at
