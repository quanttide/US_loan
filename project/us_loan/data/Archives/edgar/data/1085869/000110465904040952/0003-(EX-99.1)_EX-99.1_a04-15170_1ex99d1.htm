<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">AUSTIN, Texas, December 20, 2004 &#151;Perficient, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a
leading business consulting and technology services firm in the central United
States, today announced it has acquired ZettaWorks LLC, a Houston-based

ZettaWorks has grown rapidly &#151; from startup to $16 million in revenues in four
years. With this acquisition, and our continued solid organic growth, our goal
is to achieve a $100 million annual revenue run rate before the end of 2005, a
full year ahead of our previously stated target.&#148;</font></p>
