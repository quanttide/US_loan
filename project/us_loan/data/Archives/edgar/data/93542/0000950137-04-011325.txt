ITEM 8.01      OTHER EVENTS

On December 17, 2004, the Board of Directors of Enesco Group, Inc. determined
that the Company will stabilize its current Enterprise-wide Resource Planning
system by using the core components of its former legacy software system. Enesco
also is planning to upgrade certain modules of the legacy software system to
provide advanced features and capabilities required by the business.

Enesco will incur accelerated depreciation charges related to its current ERP
system of approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and
approximately $6 million in the first six months of 2005 related to the expected
discontinuance of use of its current ERP system. Enesco expects the costs
related to the implementation and enhancements to be between $1-2 million and
anticipates the changes will be completed in the third quarter of 2005.
