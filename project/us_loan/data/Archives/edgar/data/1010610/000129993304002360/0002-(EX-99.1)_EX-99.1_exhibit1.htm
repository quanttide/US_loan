<P align="center" style="font-size: 20pt"><B>In Leading Houston Ambulatory Surgery Center</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 20pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt"><B>St. Louis, MO, December&nbsp;20, 2004 </B>&#150; TLC Vision Corporation (NASDAQ:TLCV; TSX:TLC), North
America&#146;s premier eye care services company, announced today it&#146;s subsidiary, OR Partners, has
become the single largest shareholder in Summit Ambulatory Surgery Center, a 12-partner facility
located in Houston, Texas.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">This is the fifth ambulatory surgery center (&#147;ASC&#148;) OR Partners and TLC<I>Vision </I>have acquired in the
last 16&nbsp;months, with several ASC deals in development. OR Partners acquires, develops, and manages
ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physicians. These centers provide out-patient
surgery services in a less institutional atmosphere than can be achieved in a hospital setting and
appeal to doctors seeking improved efficiencies and the highest degree in patient satisfaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Led by John J. Garrrett, MD, a cataract surgeon with more than 30&nbsp;years experience, the Summit
Ambulatory Surgery Center is a highly successful facility featuring two operating rooms and
performing nearly 5000 ophthalmic and pain management procedures annually. Dr.&nbsp;Garrett said, &#147;OR
Partners is well capitalized, managed by a team of experienced professionals and committed to
achieve results. Most importantly, from a physician&#146;s perspective, they understand that patients
are the number one priority. I am very excited about being associated with OR Partners, improving
operational efficiencies and growing the center.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Mary T. Green, MD, one of 12 partners in Summit Ambulatory Surgery Center, has also worked with the
laser refractive division of TLC<I>Vision </I>for 3&nbsp;years. Dr.&nbsp;Green said, &#147;I know the quality of service
this company provides and the commitment to their doctor customers. When I heard about the OR
Partners subsidiary, and the great work they were doing in ASCs, it just made sense to continue the
relationships already built with TLC<I>Vision</I>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">&#147;Through our current network of over 1100 ophthalmologists, we will continue to acquire or develop
similar centers in association with some of the country&#146;s most prominent surgeons,&#148; commented Jim
Wachtman, TLC<I>Vision</I>&#146;s CEO. &#147;This approach will broaden our eye care services strategy and be
immediately accretive to TLC<I>Vision&#146;</I>s cash flow and profitability.&#148;
