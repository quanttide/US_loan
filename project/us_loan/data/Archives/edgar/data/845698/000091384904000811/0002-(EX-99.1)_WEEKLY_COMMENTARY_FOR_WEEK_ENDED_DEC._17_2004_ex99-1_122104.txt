             WEEKLY COMMENTARY FOR THE WEEK ENDED DECEMBER 17, 2004

The Fund experienced a relatively flat week, ending the session with slight
losses. Positions in the financials and energies recorded losses; gains came
from the currency and agricultural/softs sectors.

Long positions in the financial (fixed income) sector lost ground with positions
in the foreign markets recording the largest setbacks. Positive economic reports
were released throughout the week, a bearish factor for fixed income prices as
interest rates would be expected to rise in a growing economy. Prices for German
bunds, the Euro BOBL and Eurex bunds fell on stronger-than-expected news
regarding the German economy. The IFO Business Climate Index registered 96.2
during the month of December, its highest reading since April of this year and
better than the 93.8 that economists had anticipated. Longs in the British short
sterling and Liffe Euribor also posted losses as prices were lower after British
retail sales data pointed to a spike in business activity. Longs in the Japanese
bond market were undercut after the Tankan report (a quarterly survey of
Japanese companies conducted by the Bank of Japan) showed that manufacturers had
increased their expectations for capital spending and profits in the coming
months, which was bearish news for fixed income prices. Long positions in the
domestic market also recorded losses as prices for Treasury futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade fell on news that weekly jobless claims fell 43,000 to
317,000, the biggest weekly drop since December of 2001.

Short positions in the energy sector posted losses over the week. Reports that
terrorists were calling for renewed attacks on Mideast oil facilities drove
crude prices back above the $46 level as the market staged a 4.8% rally on
Friday. Forecasts for frigid temperatures across the U.S. Midwest and Northeast
also contributed to the increase in prices. January crude was $5.57 higher at
the end of the week, settling at $46.28 per barrel. Unleaded gas rose 11.02
cents. Natural gas was 61.4 cents higher while heating oil finished a little
more than 21 cents better than last week's close.

Long positions in foreign currencies posted gains. The British pound gained more
than 2 cents against the U.S. dollar on the better-than-expected retail sales
data, reaching a 12-year high against the dollar at one point during the week.
Longs in Japanese yen garnered positive returns as the favorable Tankan report
spurred a rally in the

currency. Gains also came from long positions in the Australian dollar, the euro
and the New Zealand dollar. Short positions in the U.S. dollar index benefited
from a 0.47 point drop in the index.

Lastly, long positions in the 'soft' commodities enjoyed positive returns. March
coffee futures rallied 7 cents for the week to close at $1.0430 per pound.
Prices reached a four-and-a-half year high as Brazil's agricultural ministry
reported that the country's 2005-06 coffee crop would be smaller than the
previous year. Analysts said that some new buying by large funds triggered "stop
loss" buying on behalf of market participants holding short positions.
