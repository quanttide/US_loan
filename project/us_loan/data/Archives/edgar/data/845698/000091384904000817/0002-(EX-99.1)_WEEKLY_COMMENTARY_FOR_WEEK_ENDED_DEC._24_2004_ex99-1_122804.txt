             WEEKLY COMMENTARY FOR THE WEEK ENDED DECEMBER 24, 2004

The Fund posted gains over the Christmas holiday week. Positions in the stock
indices, currencies and metals made the biggest advances while losses came from
the soft commodity/agricultural sector.

Long positions in the stock indices were earners as equity prices ended the
trading week on a firm note, buoyed by favorable news regarding the U.S.
economy. The Commerce Department announced on Wednesday that the U.S. Gross
Domestic Product grew 4% in the third-quarter, slightly better than what
economists had anticipated. The positive GDP number combined with falling oil
prices managed to push stocks higher by the end of the shortened holiday week.
The S&P Composite Index settled 13.40 points higher, aided in part by a rally in
Fannie Mae's stock. The NASDAQ-100 contract rose 8 points for the week. Long
positions overseas also reported gains. The Canadian S&P, Australian All
Ordinaries and German DAX all settled higher and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong and
the Tokyo Nikkei were also higher at the close of the session.

Longs in the foreign currency sector posted positive results. The U.S. dollar
lost ground to most of its trading partners during a relatively light-volume
session in anticipation of the Christmas break. The euro gained 1.96 cents as it
established another new high versus the greenback, trading above the $1.35 level
for the first time. Longs in the Japanese yen, South African rand and Swiss
franc also benefited as those currencies firmed against the dollar. Gains also
came from longs in the Australian dollar and Mexican peso.

Metals prices rose during the week, adding value to the Fund's long positions.
Gains were mainly made in the base metals, with the aluminum, zinc and lead
contracts on the London Metals Exchange all settling the week higher on what
analysts described as strong technical buying. Aluminum was particularly strong
in posting a new nine-and-a-half year high of $1,887 bid/tonne on Tuesday. Longs
in the silver market benefited from an 11 cent rally in the March contract.

Lastly, positions in the agricultural/softs sector posted losses this week.
Short positions in the corn contract on the Chicago Board of Trade lost ground
as the March contract gained 2.50 cents during the abbreviated trading week.
Shorts in the Kansas City wheat market also registered losses as prices there
ended the session slightly higher. Analysts said that concerns over colder
temperatures across Midwestern growing regions contributed to the higher grain
prices. Shorts in the sugar market sustained losses as the March contract gained
0.22 cents per pound by the close on Thursday.
