            KRAMONT ANNOUNCES DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO BE ACQUIRED FOR
                             $23.50 PER COMMON SHARE
   --TRANSACTION REFLECTS AN ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.25 BILLION--

     Plymouth Meeting, Penn. December 19, 2004--Kramont Realty Trust (NYSE:KRT)
announced today that it has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
providing for the merger of the Company into Centro Watt America REIT III
L.L.C., an affiliate of Melbourne, Australia-based Centro Properties Limited
(ASX:CNP). Simultaneously, other affiliates of Centro will be merged into
Kramont Operating Partnership, L.P. and Montgomery CV Realty L.P. (the
"Operating Partnerships"). The transaction is expected to close during the first
quarter of 2005.

     In the transaction, which was unanimously approved by Kramont's Board of
Trustees, holders of the outstanding shares of Kramont and outstanding limited
partnership units ("OP Units") of the Operating Partnerships will receive:

            $23.50 per Common Share and per OP Unit.

            Either one series B-1 preferred share in Centro Watt America REIT
            III L.L.C., or, under certain circumstances, $25.00, plus accrued
            and unpaid dividends, per Series B-1 Preferred Share (NYSE:KRTPR).
            Holders of each Series B-1 Preferred Share are currently entitled to
            convert such Share into Kramont Common Shares.

            $25.00 (the liquidation preference), plus accrued and unpaid
            dividends, per Series E Cumulative Preferred Share (NYSE:KRTPRE).

Assuming a $23.50 price per Common Share, the acquisition would provide a
premium of approximately 17% over Kramont's closing Common Share price of $20.08
on December 17, 2004.

     The agreement calls for the payment of the previously announced regular
quarterly distributions on Kramont's Common and Preferred Shares to shareholders
of record as of January 3, 2005 and December 28, 2004, respectively and payment
of declared distributions to holders of record of OP Units as of January 3,
2005. The amount of any subsequent distributions will be deducted from the price
paid for Common Shares and OP Units.

     The transaction is subject to the approval of Kramont's Common and Series
B-1 shareholders voting together and customary closing conditions. Cohen &
