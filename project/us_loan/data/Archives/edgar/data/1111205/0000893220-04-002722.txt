ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

Merger Agreement

         Kramont Realty Trust ("Kramont") and its controlled operating
partnership subsidiaries, Kramont Operating Partnership, L.P. ("Kramont OP") and
Montgomery CV Realty L.P. ("Montgomery OP"), have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of December 18, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"), with
Centro Watt America REIT III LLC ("CWA III"), CWAR OP Merger Sub, LLC ("Merger
Sub") and CWAR OP Merger Sub II, LLC ("Merger Sub II" and together with CWA III
and Merger Sub, the "Purchaser Parties"), Centro Properties Limited ("Centro
Properties"), CPT Manager Limited, both in its capacity as the responsible
entity of Centro Property Trust ("Centro Trust" and together with Centro
Properties, the "Parent Parties") and in its own right.

         Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, Kramont will be merged with and into CWA III, with
CWA III being the surviving entity; Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Kramont OP, with Kramont OP being the surviving entity; and Merger Sub II will
be merged with and into Montgomery OP, with Montgomery OP being the surviving
entity. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the mergers the
following will occur:

         (i) each outstanding share of Kramont's common shares of beneficial
interest, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Shares"), other than Common Shares
owned by any subsidiary of Kramont or by the Purchaser Parties or any of their
respective subsidiaries, shall be converted into the right to receive $23.50,
subject to adjustment as described below (the "Common Share Merger
Consideration"), in cash, without interest;

         (ii) each outstanding share of Kramont's 9.75% Series B-1 Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Series B-1 Preferred
Shares"), other than Series B-1 Preferred Shares owned by any subsidiary of
Kramont or by the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries,
will be converted into the right to receive either (a) subject to the next
clause, one share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock of CWA III or (b) if and as
permitted by applicable law and Kramont's Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust in effect at the effective time of the merger of Kramont into CWA III,
$25.00 (plus all accrued and unpaid distributions (whether or not declared)
existing prior to the effective time) in cash, without interest;

         (iii) each outstanding share of Kramont's 8.25% Series E Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Series E Preferred
Shares"), other than Series E Preferred Shares owned by any subsidiary of
Kramont or by the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries,
will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 (plus all accrued and unpaid
distributions (whether or not declared) existing prior to the effective time) in
cash, without interest;

         (iv) each outstanding option to acquire Common Shares, whether or not
then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the
Common Share Merger Consideration per share over the exercise or purchase price
per share of such option, and (b) the number of Common Shares subject thereto;

         (v) each outstanding limited partnership unit of Kramont OP ("Kramont
OP Unit"), other than limited partnership units owned by Kramont or any Kramont
subsidiary or by the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries,
shall be converted into the right to receive $23.50, subject to adjustment as
described below, in cash, without interest; and

         (vi) each outstanding limited partnership unit of Montgomery OP
("Montgomery OP Unit") other than units owned by Kramont or any Kramont
subsidiary or by the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries,
shall be converted into the right to receive $23.50, subject to adjustment as
described below, in cash, without interest.

         Holders of Series B-1 Preferred Shares currently are entitled to
convert such shares into Common Shares in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in Kramont's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as
supplemented.

         On December 7, 2004, Kramont declared a regular quarterly cash
distribution of $0.325 per Common Share and per Kramont OP Unit and $0.29 per
Montgomery OP Unit, payable January 21, 2005 on the Common Shares and January 20
on the Kramont OP Units and Montgomery OP Units, to shareholders and unitholders
of record on January 3, 2005 (the "2004 Fourth Quarter Distributions"). In the
event Kramont, Kramont OP or Montgomery OP declares and pays any distribution
other than the 2004 Fourth Quarter Distributions on the Common Shares, the
Kramont OP Units or the Montgomery OP Units, the consideration per share or per
unit, as the case may be, to be received by the holders of such securities at
the effective time of the mergers will be reduced by the per share or per unit
amount of such additional distributions on the respective securities.

         The Merger Agreement further provides that all trustees and directors
(and comparable managers, officers and other personnel requested by CWA III) of
Kramont and each Kramont subsidiary will resign effective upon the consummation
of the mergers. Louis P. Meshon, Sr., the President, Chief Executive Officer and
a trustee of Kramont, is expected to leave his current position following the
completion of the mergers. Following the mergers, Kramont will cease to be a
reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and its
Common Shares, Series B-1 Preferred Shares and Series E Preferred Shares will
cease to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The mergers are subject to
approval by the holders of Kramont's Common Shares and Series B-1 Preferred
Shares voting together as a single class, the receipt of regulatory approvals
and other customary closing conditions.

         The Merger Agreement provides that the Parent Parties, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, jointly and severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee prior to the effective time of the
mergers, to each of the Company Parties and, on or after the effective time of
the mergers, to the former holders of Common Shares, Series B-1 Preferred
Shares, Series E Preferred Shares, Kramont OP Units, Montgomery OP Units and
Company Options and each current and former trustee, director, officer, general
partner, managing


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

member, manager or fiduciary of Kramont or any Kramont subsidiary, in their
capacities as such, the due and punctual payment in full of each obligation of
the Purchaser Parties under the Merger Agreement, as it may be from time to time
amended, supplemented or modified in accordance with its respective terms, and
the transactions contemplated thereby. The guarantee constitutes a continuing
guarantee of payment and not collection.

         The Merger Agreement also provides that, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions described therein, if reasonably requested by CWA III, the
parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to modify the structure of the
transactions contemplated thereby if, among other things, the modifications do
not adversely effect the economic rights or expected tax treatment of Kramont's
shareholders or the holders of Kramont OP Units or Montgomery OP Units provided
for in the Merger Agreement, would not be reasonably expected to cause a delay
in the closing of the mergers and do not adversely effect the terms or
enforceability of the guaranty and the indemnification rights of current and
former trustees, directors, officers, general partners, managing members,
managers or fiduciaries of Kramont or any of its subsidiaries.

Amendments to Employment Agreements and Employment Agreements

         At a meeting held June 10, 2004, the Board of Trustees of Kramont
initiated the process that, with the assistance of the Compensation Committee,
resulted in amendments, effective July 1, 2004, to the employment agreements of
Kramont's four executive officers (Louis P. Meshon, Sr., George S. Demuth, Carl
E. Kraus and Etta M. Strehle) and six other officers to, among other things,
increase their base salaries, extend their employment terms and provide for
payments to any of the executive officers and the six other officers if,
following a "Change of Control" (as defined in the amendments) of Kramont, the
executive (i) is terminated by Kramont or its successor without "Cause" (as
defined in the amendments), (ii) Kramont or its successor fails to renew the
executive's employment agreement without cause or (iii) the executive terminates
employment with Kramont or its successor for "Good Reason" (as defined in the
amendments) with in one year after the Change of Control. In such event, (A) the
executive would be paid a lump sum equal to the sum of (1) the product of one or
two, as specified in the executive's amendment (the "Multiple"), times the sum
of the executive's annual base salary plus, in the case of Messrs. Meshon,
Demuth and Kraus, the executive's average annual bonus paid during the three
years prior to the Change of Control plus (2) all accrued and unpaid bonus and
other awards and unreimbursed expenses, and (B) all unvested stock options and
other awards held by the executive shall become fully vested. Kramont also
authorized employment agreements, effective various dates, with three other
officers providing for similar treatment following a Change of Control. At a
meeting held December 18, 2004, the Board of Trustees authorized changes to the
previously approved amendment to Mr. Meshon's employment agreement to add to the
definition of Good Reason the occurrence of any Change of Control and to
increase the Multiple applicable to him from two to three. Notwithstanding the
increase in the Multiple from two to three, the amendment to Mr. Meshon's
employment agreement provides that in no event shall any payment be made to Mr.
Meshon to the extent that such payment would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1984, as amended. Each executive has no obligation to mitigate these severance
obligations and no amounts the executive earns following termination of
employment with Kramont will reduce the amounts Kramont is obligated to pay the
executive.

         The amendments to the employment agreements and the employment
agreements were entered into by the respective parties between December 18 and
20, 2004. The foregoing description of the amendments to the employment
agreements of the executive officers is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the amendments which are filed as exhibits to this Form 8-K and are

                    SECOND AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      This Second Amendment to Employment Agreement (this "Second Amendment") is
effective as of December 18th, 2004 by and among Kramont Operating Partnership,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Company"), Kramont Realty Trust, a
Maryland real estate investment trust ("Kramont") and Louis P. Meshon, Sr.
("Executive").

                                   BACKGROUND

      WHEREAS, Kramont and Executive have entered into an Employment Agreement
dated effective as of June 16, 2000, as amended by a First Amendment to
Employment Agreement dated effective as of July 1, 2004 (herein referred to as
"Employment Agreement") wherein the parties agreed to the terms and conditions
of Executive's employment with the Company; and

      WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to further amend certain of the terms
and conditions of the Employment Agreement.

      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

      1. The definition of "Change of Control" set forth in Paragraph 7(e) of
the Employment Agreement is amended and Paragraph 7(e) of the Employment
Agreement is restated to read in its entirety as follows:

      "(e) Executive shall have the right to terminate his employment under this
Agreement for Good Reason. "Good Reason" means (i) the assignment to Executive
of any duties materially inconsistent with his status as President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company; (ii) a material breach by the Company of any
material provision of this Agreement which breach is not remedied within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Company of notice thereof from Executive or,
notwithstanding such cure, repeated or systematic and material breaches by the
Company of any material provision of this Agreement; or (iii) any Change in
Control of the Company. "Change of Control" means the closing of a transaction
or a series of related transactions which involves (i) a transfer of all or
substantially all of Kramont's or the Company's assets and business (whether
structured as an acquisition, sale of assets, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, and whether or not Kramont or the Company is the surviving entity of
the transaction); (ii) an exchange of 35% or more of equity securities of
Kramont for assets or stock of another entity or Person, or (iii) the election
to the Company's Board of Trustees after a transaction described in (i) or (ii)
of this paragraph of new trustees not formerly associated with Kramont
constituting a majority of the number of Trustees of the Company then in
office."

      2. The second sentence of Paragraph 7(f) is hereby replaced in its
entirety with the following language:
<PAGE>

      "Upon termination of Executive's employment under Paragraph 7(e) of this
Agreement, in addition to the benefits provided under Paragraph 4(d):
(i) Executive shall become immediately entitled to receive a lump sum payment by
Kramont(or its successor in interest) in an amount equal to three (3) times the
sum of the annual Base Salary and bonus, plus all accrued and unpaid bonus and
other awards and unreimbursed expenses; (ii) all stock options and other awards
subject to vesting period not then expired shall, effective upon such Closing,
become fully vested; and (iii) Kramont (or its successor in interest) shall
continue the medical, dental and life insurance coverages (or coverage similar
thereto) being provided Executive immediately prior to the date of termination
of employment which shall be continued in effect, at the Company's expense
(provided that coverage can be obtained at commercially reasonable rates), for a
period ending on the sooner of three years from the date of termination of
employment or the date in which Executive obtains new employment which provides
him with such coverage; provided, however, that in no event shall any payment be
made under this Section 7(f) to the extent such payment would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code, of 1986, as amended (the "Code") determined without regard to
Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code. For purposes of computing the sum of the Base
Salary and bonus due hereunder, bonus shall mean the regular average annual
bonus as determined previously by the Board's Compensation Committee paid to the
Executive during the three years prior to the event giving rise to the payment.
Executive shall have no obligation to mitigate the Company's severance
obligations under this paragraph and no amounts earned by Executive following
such termination shall be deemed to reduce the payments required under this
Paragraph 7(f). Such payments shall be in lieu of any and all entitlements that
Executive may have by contract or otherwise. Any payments hereunder shall be
conditioned on the execution by the Executive of a General Release in a form
satisfactory to Kramont (other than with respect to the obligation of Kramont
and the Company or their successors in interest hereunder)."

      3. Paragraph 9(a) of the Employment Agreement in amended and restated to
read in its entirety as follows:

         "(a) Not to hire, directly or indirectly, or entice or participate in
any efforts to entice to leave the Company's employ, any person who was an
employee of the Company, provided however that this restriction shall not apply
to Louis P. Meshon, Jr."

      4. Paragraph 9(b) of the Employment Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety.

      5. This Second Amendment and the Employment Agreement represent the entire
understanding between the parties and supersedes all other oral or written
agreements between the parties. The Employment Agreement, as amended by this
Second Amendment, is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force and
effect.

                                        2

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this
Second Amendment as of the date and year first above written.

                     THIRD AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         This Third Amendment (this "Third Amendment") is effective July 1, 2004
by and among Kramont Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(the "Company"), Kramont Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust
("Kramont") and George S. Demuth ("Executive").

                                   Background

         WHEREAS, the parties hereto entered into an Employment Agreement dated
effective July 1, 2001, as amended by First Amendment dated July 1, 2002 and
Second Amendment dated July 1, 2003 (herein referred to as "Employment
Agreement") wherein the parties agreed to the terms and conditions of
Executive's employment with the Company; and

         WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to further amend certain of the
terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

         1.       All capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined,
shall have the meanings ascribed in the Employment Agreement, with the exception
of the definitions of "Change of Control" and "Good Reason", which shall be
defined as follows:

         "Change of Control" means the closing of a transaction or a series of
related transactions which involves (i) a transfer of all or substantially all
of Kramont's or the Company's assets and business (whether structured as an
acquisition, sale of assets, merger, consolidation or otherwise, and whether or
not Kramont or the Company is the surviving entity of the transaction), (ii) an
exchange of 35% or more of equity securities of Kramont for assets or stock of
another entity or Person, or (iii) the election to the Company's Board of
Trustees after a transaction described in (i) or (ii) of this paragraph of new
trustees not formerly associated with Kramont constituting a majority of the
number of Trustees of the Company then in office. A Change of Control will not
be deemed to have occurred, with respect to the Executive, if the Executive is
part of or affiliated with the group that consummates the change of control
transaction.

         "Good Reason" means: (a) a material breach by Company of any material
provision of this Agreement, (b) a material diminution in the level of
responsibilities or authority or compensation of Executive; or (c) Company's
requiring Executive to be based at any office or location outside of 50 miles
from the City of Philadelphia, provided, however, that no event or condition
described in clauses (a) through (c) of this definition shall constitute Good
Reason unless (i) Executive gives the Company written notice of his or her
objection to such event or condition, (ii) such event or condition is not
corrected by the Company within 20 business days of its receipt of such notice
(the "Cure Period") (or in the event that such event or condition is not
susceptible of correction within such 20 business day Cure Period, the Company
has not taken all reasonable steps within such Cure Period to correct such event
or condition as promptly as practicable thereafter and does, in fact, correct
such event or condition within ninety (90) days following the date that the
Executives gives the Company written notice of his or her objection)) and (iii)
Executive resigns his or her employment with the Company and its Affiliates by
written notice to the Company not more than 90 days following the expiration of
the 20 business day


<PAGE>


Cure Period The closing of a transaction entered into with the prior consent of
the Board of Trustees of Kramont or events which would have constituted a Change
in Control shall not constitute "Good Reason" unless a violation of clauses (a),
(b) or (c) of this definition occurs within one year of the closing of the
transaction and the Executive complies with all the other requirements of this
definition

         2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph
6(c), "Termination and Severance Benefits" - Without Cause: Good Reason," the
following shall replace the language contained in the Employment Agreement:

                  6(d) Without Cause: Good Reason. If, prior to the expiration
of the Term of Employment, Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
without Cause or the Company fails to renew an employment agreement without
cause, or if Executive terminates employment hereunder for Good Reason:
Executive shall become immediately entitled to receive a lump sum payment by the
Company (or its successor in interest) in an amount equal to two (2) times the
annual Base Salary, plus all accrued and unpaid bonus and other awards and
unreimbursed expenses. In the event that the Executive terminates employment
hereunder for Good Reason, all stock options and other awards subject to vesting
periods not then expired shall become fully vested. Executive shall have no
further right to receive any other compensation or benefits after such
termination or resignation of employment. Executive shall have no obligation to
mitigate the Company's severance obligations under this paragraph and no amounts
earned by Executive following such termination shall be deemed to reduce the
payments required under this paragraph 6(d). Such payments shall be in lieu of
any and all entitlements that Executive may have by contract or otherwise." Any
payments hereunder shall be conditioned on the execution by the Executive of a
General Release in a form satisfactory to Kramont.

                  3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Paragraph 6(e) "Termination and Severance Benefits - Change of Control," the
following shall replace the language contained in the Employment Agreement:

                           6(d) Change in Control. In the event of a Change of
Control, and the Executive is not offered the same or similar position with the
same or similar salary and benefits with the Company prior to the closing of the
transaction, or its successor in interest, or the entity surviving the Change of
Control, Executive shall have the right to terminate his or her employment by
written notice to the Company given within thirty (30) days after the closing
("Closing") of the transactions giving rise to the Change of Control, in which
case, effective within ten (10) days following the Company's receipt of
Executive's termination notice: (i) Executive shall become immediately entitled
to receive a lump sum payment by the Company (or its successor in interest) in
an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of the annual Base Salary and bonus,
plus all accrued and unpaid bonus and other awards and unreimbursed expenses;
and (ii) all stock options and other awards subject to vesting periods not then
expired shall, effective upon such Closing, become fully vested. For purposes of
computing the sum of the base salary and bonus due hereunder, bonus shall mean
the regular average annual bonus as determined previously by the Board's
Compensation Committee paid to the Executive during the three years prior to the
event giving rise to the payment. Executive shall have no obligation to mitigate
the Company's severance obligations under this paragraph and no amounts earned
by Executive following such termination shall be deemed to reduce the payments
required under this paragraph 6(d). Such payments shall be in lieu of any and
all entitlements that Executive may have by contract or otherwise. Any payments
hereunder shall be conditioned on the execution by the Executive of a General
Release in a form satisfactory to Kramont.


<PAGE>


         4. Subject to the provisions contained in Paragraph 3 of the Employment
Agreement, the Term of Employment is hereby extended to December 31, 2005 (the
"Extended Term of Employment").

         5.       During the Extended Term of Employment, Executive's Base
Salary shall be $212,180.00 payable in equal bi-weekly installments in
accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices, subject to periodic
review by the Board of Trustees. Executive shall also be eligible to participate
in any bonus plan, as approved by the Board of Trustees.

         6.       This Third Amendment and the Employment Agreement represent
the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all other oral or
written agreements between the parties. The Employment Agreement, as amended by
this Third Amendment, is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force
and effect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this
Third Amendment as of the date and year first above written.

                    FOURTH AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

        This Fourth Amendment (this "Fourth Amendment") is effective July 1,
2004 by and among Kramont Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Company"), Kramont Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate
investment trust ("Kramont") and Etta M. Strehle ("Executive").

                                   BACKGROUND

        WHEREAS, the parties hereto entered into an Employment Agreement
effective June 16, 2000, as amended by First Amendment effective July 1, 2001
and Second Amendment effective July 1, 2002 and Third Amendment effective July
1, 2003 (herein referred to as "Employment Agreement") wherein the parties
agreed to the terms and conditions of Executive's employment with the Company;
and

        WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to further amend certain of the terms
and conditions of the Employment Agreement.

        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

        1.      All capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined,
shall have the meanings ascribed in the Employment Agreement, with the exception
of the definitions of "Change of Control" and "Good Reason", which shall be
defined as follows:

        "Change of Control" means the closing of a transaction or a series of
related transactions which involves (i) a transfer of all or substantially all
of Kramont's or the Company's assets and business (whether structured as an
acquisition, sale of assets, merger, consolidation or otherwise, and whether or
not Kramont or the Company is the surviving entity of the transaction); (ii) an
exchange of 35% or more of equity securities of Kramont for assets or stock of
another entity or Person, or (iii) the election to the Company's Board of
Trustees after a transaction described in (i) or (ii) of this paragraph of new
trustees not formerly associated with Kramont constituting a majority of the
number of Trustees of the Company then in office. A Change of Control will not
be deemed to have occurred, with respect to the Executive, if the Executive is
part of or affiliated with the group that consummates the change of control
transaction.

        "Good Reason" means: (a) a material breach by Company of any material
provision of this Agreement, (b) a material diminution in the level of
responsibilities or authority or compensation of Executive; or (c) Company's
requiring Executive to be based at any office or location outside of 100 miles
from the City of Philadelphia, provided, however, that no event or condition
described in clauses (a) through (c) of this definition shall constitute Good
Reason unless (i) Executive gives the Company written notice of his or her
objection to such event or condition, (ii) such event or condition is not
corrected by the Company within 20 business days of its receipt of such notice
(the "Cure Period") (or in the event that such event or condition is not
susceptible of correction within such 20 business day Cure Period, the Company
has not taken all reasonable steps within such Cure Period to correct such event
or condition as promptly as practicable thereafter and does, in fact, correct
such event or condition within ninety (90) days following the date that the
Executives gives the Company written notice of his or her objection)) and (iii)
Executive resigns his or her employment with the Company and its Affiliates by
written

<PAGE>

notice to the Company not more than 90 days following the expiration of the 20
business day Cure Period. The closing of a transaction entered into with the
prior consent of the Board of Trustees of Kramont or events which would have
constituted a Change in Control shall not constitute "Good Reason" unless a
violation of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this definition occurs within one year
of the closing of the transaction and the Executive complies with all the other
requirements of this definition.

        2.      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Paragraph 6(4), "Termination and Severance Benefits" - Without Case: Good
Reason," the following shall replace the language contained in the Employment
Agreement:

                6(4) Without Cause: Good Reason. If, prior to the expiration of
the Term of Employment, Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
without Cause or the Company fails to renew an employment agreement without
cause, or if Executive terminates employment hereunder for Good Reason:
Executive shall become immediately entitled to receive a lump sum payment by the
Company (or its successor in interest) in an amount equal to one (1) times the
annual Base Salary, plus all accrued and unpaid bonus and other awards and
unreimbursed expenses. In the event that the Executive terminates employment
hereunder for Good Reason, all stock options and other awards subject to vesting
periods not then expired shall become fully vested. Executive shall have no
further right to receive any other compensation or benefits after such
termination or resignation of employment. Executive shall have no obligation to
mitigate the Company's severance obligations under this paragraph and no amounts
earned by Executive following such termination shall be deemed to reduce the
payments required under this paragraph 6(4). Such payments shall be in lieu of
any and all entitlements that Executive may have by contract or otherwise." Any
payments hereunder shall be conditioned on the execution by the Executive of a
General Release in a form satisfactory to Kramont. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Paragraph 6(5) "Termination and Severance Benefits -
Change of Control," the following shall replace the language contained in the
Employment Agreement.

        3.      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Paragraph 6(5) "Termination and Severance Benefits - Change of Control," the
following shall replace the language contained in the Employment Agreement:

                        "6(5) Change in Control. In the event of a Change of
Control, and the Executive is not offered the same or similar position with the
same or similar salary and benefits with the Company prior to the closing of the
transaction, or its successor in interest, or the entity surviving the Change of
Control, Executive shall have the right to terminate his or her employment by
written notice to the Company given within thirty (30) days after the closing
("Closing") of the transactions giving rise to the Change of Control, in which
case, effective within ten (10) days following the Company's receipt of
Executive's termination notice: (i) Executive shall become immediately entitled
to receive a lump sum payment by the Company (or its successor in interest) in
an amount equal to two (2) times the annual Base Salary, plus all accrued and
unpaid bonus and other awards and unreimbursed expenses; and (ii) all stock
options and other awards subject to vesting periods not then expired shall,
effective upon such Closing, become fully vested. Executive shall have no
obligation to mitigate the Company's severance obligations under this paragraph
and no amounts earned by Executive following such termination shall be deemed to
reduce the payments required under this paragraph 6(5). Such payments shall be
in lieu of any and all entitlements that Executive may have by contract or
otherwise. Any payments hereunder shall be conditioned on the execution by the
Executive of a General Release in a form satisfactory to Kramont.

        This Third Amendment (this "Third Amendment") is effective July 1, 2004
by and among Kramont Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(the "Company"), Kramont Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust

                                   BACKGROUND

        WHEREAS, the parties hereto entered into an Employment Agreement dated
effective March 21, 2002, as amended by First Amendment dated July 1, 2002 and
Second Amendment dated July 1, 2003 (herein referred to as "Employment
Agreement") wherein the parties agreed to the terms and conditions of
Executive's employment with the Company; and

        WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to further amend certain of the terms
and conditions of the Employment Agreement.

        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

        1.      All capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined,
shall have the meanings ascribed in the Employment Agreement, with the exception
of the definitions of "Change of Control" and "Good Reason", which shall be
defined as follows:


        "Change of Control" means the closing of a transaction or a series of
related transactions which involves (i) a transfer of all or substantially all
of Kramont's or the Company's assets and business (whether structured as an
acquisition, sale of assets, merger, consolidation or otherwise, and whether or
not Kramont or the Company is the surviving entity of the transaction); (ii) an
exchange of 35% or more of equity securities of Kramont for assets or stock of
another entity or Person, or (iii) the election to the Company's Board of
Trustees after a transaction described in (i) or (ii) of this paragraph of new
trustees not formerly associated with Kramont constituting a majority of the
number of Trustees of the Company then in office. A Change of Control will not
be deemed to have occurred, with respect to the Executive, if the Executive is
part of or affiliated with the group that consummates the change of control
transaction.

        "Good Reason" means (a) a material breach by Company of any material
provision of this Agreement, (b) a material diminution in the level of
responsibilities or authority or compensation of Executive; or (c) Company's
requiring Executive to be based at any office or location outside of 50 miles
from the City of Philadelphia, provided, however, that no event or condition
described in clauses (a) through (c) of this definition shall constitute Good
Reason unless (i) Executive gives the Company written notice of his or her
objection to such event or condition, (ii) such event or condition is not
corrected by the Company within 20 business days of its receipt of such notice
(the "Cure Period") (or in the event that such event or condition is not
susceptible of correction within such 20 business day Cure Period, the Company
has not taken all reasonable steps within such Cure Period to correct such event
or condition as promptly as practicable thereafter and does, in fact, correct
such event or condition within ninety (90) days following the date that the
Executive gives the Company written notice of his or her objection)) and (iii)
Executive resigns his or her employment with the Company and its Affiliates by
written



                                       1

<PAGE>
notice to the Company not more than 90 days following the expiration of the 20
business day Cure Period. The closing of a transaction entered into with the
prior consent of the Board of Trustees of Kramont or events which would have
constituted a Change in Control shall not constitute "Good Reason" unless a
violation of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this definition occurs within one year
of the closing of the transaction and the Executive complies with all the other
requirements of this definition.


        2.      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Paragraph 6(4), "Termination and Severance Benefits" - Without Cause: Good
Reason," the following shall replace the language contained in the Employment
Agreement:

                                "6(4) Without Cause: Good Reason. If, prior to
the expiration of the Term of Employment, Executive's employment is terminated
by the Company without Cause or the Company fails to renew an employment
agreement without cause, or if Executive terminates employment hereunder for
Good Reason: Executive shall become immediately entitled to receive a lump sum
payment by the Company (or its successor in interest) in an amount equal to two
(2) times the annual Base Salary, plus all accrued and unpaid bonus and other
awards and unreimbursed expenses. In the event that the Executive terminates
employment hereunder for Good Reason, all stock options and other awards subject
to vesting periods not then expired shall become fully vested Executive shall
have no further right to receive any other compensation or benefits after such
termination or resignation of employment. Executive shall have no obligation to
mitigate the Company's severance obligations under this paragraph and no amounts
earned by Executive following such termination shall be deemed to reduce the
payments required under this paragraph 6(4). Such payments shall be in lieu of
any and all entitlements that Executive may have by contract or otherwise." Any
payments hereunder shall be conditioned on the execution by the Executive of a
General Release in a form satisfactory to Kramont."

                3.      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Paragraph 6(5) "Termination and Severance Benefits - Change of Control," the
following shall replace the language contained in the Employment Agreement:

                                "6(5) Change in Control. In the event of a
Change of Control, and the Executive is not offered the same or similar position
with the same or similar salary and benefits with the Company prior to the
closing of the transaction, or its successor in interest, or the entity
surviving the Change of Control, Executive shall have the right to terminate his
or her employment by written notice to the Company given within thirty (30) days
after the closing ("Closing") of the transactions giving rise to the Change of
Control, in which case, effective within ten (10) days following the Company's
receipt of Executive's termination notice: (i) Executive shall become
immediately entitled to receive a lump sum payment by the Company (or its
successor in interest) in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of the annual
Base Salary and bonus, plus all accrued and unpaid bonus and other awards and
unreimbursed expenses, and (ii) all stock options and other awards subject to
vesting periods not then expired shall, effective upon such Closing, become
fully vested. For purposes of computing the sum of the base salary and bonus due
hereunder, bonus shall mean the regular average annual bonus as determined
previously by the Board's Compensation Committee paid to the Executive during
the three years prior to the event giving rise to the payment. Executive shall
have no obligation to mitigate the Company's severance obligations under this
paragraph and no amounts earned by Executive following such termination shall be
deemed to reduce the payments required under this paragraph 6(5). Such payments
shall be in lieu of any and all entitlements that Executive may



                                       2

<PAGE>

have by contract or otherwise. Any payments hereunder shall be conditioned on
the execution by the Executive of a General Release in a form satisfactory to
Kramont.

entirety.

bi-weekly installments in accordance with the Company's normal payroll

entire understanding between the parties and supersedes all other oral or
written agreements between the parties The Employment Agreement, as amended by
this Third Amendment, is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force
