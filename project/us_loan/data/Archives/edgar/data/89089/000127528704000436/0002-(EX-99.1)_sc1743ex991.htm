<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOUSTON, Dec. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Service Corporation International (NYSE: SCI), the world&#146;s largest funeral and cemetery company, announced today that it has settled the securities lawsuit filed earlier this year by T. Rowe Price and various of its related entities pending against the Company and certain of its current and former officers.&#160; T. Rowe Price had opted out of the previously announced settlement of the securities class action lawsuit that had been pending against the Company since January 1999. T. Rowe Price filed a separate lawsuit in Texas state court in June 2004.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the settlement call for the Company to pay a total of $14.8 million, of which $2.0 million has already been recognized and paid into escrow in conjunction with the class action settlement.&#160; As a result, the Company will recognize litigation expenses of $12.8 million on a pretax basis in the fourth quarter of 2004.&#160; Payment of the $12.8 million will occur in 2004.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on the announcement, Robert L. Waltrip, Chairman and CEO, said: &#147;This settlement brings to a close all material litigation related to our 1999 securities class action lawsuit.&#160; We believe that the decision to settle this litigation is in the best interests of our shareholders.&#160; This will enable us to more fully focus our energy on the many opportunities we see for growth and prosperity in the future.&#148;</font></p>
