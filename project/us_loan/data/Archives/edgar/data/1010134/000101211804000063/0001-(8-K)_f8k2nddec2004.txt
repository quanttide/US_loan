ITEM 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

The Management Board and the Supervisory Board on November 30, 2004 have
approved and adopted, subject to shareholders approval, the 2005 Equity
Incentive Plan, (the "Plan").

The Plan provides a means whereby employees, officers, directors, and certain
consultants and independent contractors of the Company ("Qualified Grantees")
may acquire the Common Shares of the Company pursuant to grants of (i) Incentive
Stock Options ("ISO"), (ii) non-qualified stock options (the "NQSO") and (iii)
restricted stock. A summary of the significant provisions of the Plan is set
forth below. A copy of the full Plan is annexed as Exhibit A to this Proxy
Statement. The following description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Plan itself.

The purpose of the Plan is to further the long-term stability, continuing growth
and financial success of the Company by attracting and retaining key employees,
directors and selected advisors through the use of stock incentives, while
stimulating the efforts of these individuals upon whose judgment and interest
the Company is and will be largely dependent for the successful conduct of its
business. The Company believes that the Plan will strengthen these persons'
desire to remain with the Company and will further the identification of those
persons' interests with those of the Company's shareholders.

The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory
Board, which shall be appointed by the Supervisory Board of the Company, and
which shall consist of a minimum of three members of the Supervisory Board of
the Company.

The Plan provides that options to purchase up to 1,500,000 Common Shares of the
Company may be issued to the employees, certain consultants and directors. All
present and future employees shall be eligible to receive incentive awards under
the Plan, and all present and future non-employee directors shall be eligible to
receive non-statutory options under the Plan. An eligible employee or
non-employee director shall be notified in writing, stating the number of shares
for which options are granted, the option price per share, and conditions
surrounding the grant and exercise of the options.

The exercise price of shares of Company Stock covered by an ISO and NQSO shall
be not less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of
grant; provided that if an ISO is granted to an employee who, at the time of the
grant, is a 10% shareholder, then the exercise price of the shares covered by
the incentive stock option shall be not less than 110% of the fair market value
of such shares on the date of grant. The Plan also provides for cashless
exercise of Options at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. In such
event, there maybe a charge to the earnings of the Company with respect to the
cashless exercise of the Options.

The Compensation Committee may determine the number of shares that may be
awarded to a participant as restricted stock and the provisions relating to risk
of forfeiture and may determine that the restricted stock is only earned upon
the satisfaction of performance goals established by


<PAGE>

the Committee. The Committee shall also determine the nature, length and
starting date of any performance period and the terms thereof.

The Compensation Committee has recommended and the Supervisory Board and the
Management Board have approved the granting of the following options under the
2005 Equity Incentive Plan subject to the Plan being approved by shareholders as
follows:

1. Menachem Atzmon (Chairman of the Board) - 550,000 options of which 250,000
shall be immediately vested and 300,000 options to be vested equally over the
next three years. With respect to the Options for 200,000 shares they are
granted in lieu of a current salary for Mr. Atzmon. Options are exercisable at
$1.35 per share representing the fair market value on the date of grant.

2. Doron Zicher (Key Employee) - 45,000 options to be vested equally over the
next three years. Options are exercisable at $1.35 per share representing the
fair market value on the date of grant.

3. Ran Langer (Managing Director) - 65,000 options to be vested equally in the
next three years. Options are exercisable at $1.35 per share representing the
fair market value on the date of grant.

4. Dan Abraham (Managing Director) - 55,000 options to be vested equally in the
next three years. Options are exercisable at $1.35 per share representing the
fair market value on the date of grant.

5. Udi Bechor (Key Employee) - 45,000 options to be vested equally in the next

market value on the date of grant.

6. Oded Shoam (Key Employee) - 50,000 options to be vested equally in the next

The Options shall be immediately vested as to 10,000 shares and shall vest
10,000 shares on each anniversary in the event such person is a Director of the
Company at that time. The options are exercisable at $1.35 per share
representing the fair market value on the date of grant.

8. (Committee Chairs) The Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of
the Compensation Committee should each be granted 30,000 additional Options. The
Options shall be immediately vested as to 10,000 shares and shall vest 10,000
shares on each anniversary in the event such person is a Director of the Company
at that time. The options are exercisable at $1.35 per share representing the
fair market value on the date of grant.

ITEM 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related
Audit Report or Completed Interiim Review.

On December 21, 2004 the Audit Committee of ICTS International, N.V. determined
that as a result of an adverse decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
reversing a favorable decision of the lower court in a case involving Pioneer
Commercial Funding, a company in which ICTS has an investment, the Company has
decided to restate its financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2004. Pioneer has asked the court for a re-hearing based upon Pioneer's belief
that the courts ruling was based in part on facts not in evidence. As a result
of the restatement, the Company has written off its entire investment in Pioneer
of $1,716,000. The effect of the restatement on the Statement of Operations for
the first quarter of March 2004 is that the "Share in Losses of Associated
Companies" increased from $5,000 to $1,721,000 and the loss for the period
increased from $7,943,000 to $9,659,000. On the balance sheet side the
"Investment in Associated Companies" decreased from $5,341,000 to $3,625,000 and
the "Retained Earnings" decreased from $22,669,000 to $20,953,000. The matter of
re-statement was reviewed with the Company's independent auditors who concurred
in the re-statement.
