Item 1.01        Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On December 22, 2004, Kansas City Southern ("KCS") or "the Company" announced
that the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, The Kansas City Southern Railway
Company ("KCSR"), and certain of its subsidiaries had entered into an amendment
and waiver of its existing credit agreement. For further information, see the
press release dated December 22, 2004 attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 2.03        Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation
                 Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant

The credit agreement was amended to, among other things, increase the term loan
by $100,000,000 to a total amount outstanding of $249,250,000 and decrease the
borrowing spread by 25 basis point to 175 basis points over LIBOR. In addition,
a waiver was granted that would allow KCSR to make an additional $55 million of
capital expenditures during 2004 and 2005. The funds borrowed under the amended
credit facility were deposited into the Closing Escrow established under the
terms of the December 15, 2004 Amended and Restated Acquisition Agreement. For
further information, see the press release dated December 22, 2004 attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

In connection with the proposed acquisition pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Acquisition Agreement, KCS will file relevant materials with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including an amended proxy statement
soliciting stockholder approval of certain actions in connection with the
transaction. Stockholders are urged to read the amended proxy statement, as well
as any amendments and supplements to the proxy statement (if and when they
become available) and any other relevant documents files with the SEC, because
they will contain important information about the transaction. Stockholders and
investors may obtain the amended proxy statement and any other relevant
documents free of charge at the SEC's Internet web site at www.sec.gov.
Stockholders may also obtain free of charge the amended proxy statement and any
other relevant documents by contacting the office of the Corporate Secretary at
KCS' principal executive offices at (816) 983-1538. Written requests should be
mailed to P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, Missouri 64121-9335 (or if by United
Parcel Service or other form of express delivery to 427 West 12th Street, Kansas
City, Missouri 64105). Such amended proxy statement is not currently available.
KCS and its directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in
the solicitation of proxies from KCS stockholders with respect to approval of
certain actions in connection with the transaction. Information regarding these
directors and executive officers and their beneficial ownership interests in KCS
can be found in KCS' proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the SEC on
April 5, 2004, in connection with the 2004 annual meeting of KCS stockholders.
Investors may obtain additional information regarding the interest of such
participants by reading the amended proxy statement files in connection with the
transaction when it becomes available.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:

         (1) The Borrower, the Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors, certain
financial institutions and other persons from time to time parties thereto
(collectively, the "Lender Parties"), the Agents, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc. ("Morgan Stanley"), as syndication agent, BNS and Morgan Stanley, as joint

documentation agent, have entered into that certain Credit Agreement dated as
of March 30, 2004 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified,
the "Credit Agreement"; capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall be
used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement).

         (2) The Borrower desires to convert outstanding Term B Advances under
the Credit Agreement to a new class of Advances under the Credit Agreement,
having identical terms with, and having the same rights and obligations under
the Loan Documents, as the Term B Advances, as set forth in the Loan Documents,
except as such terms are amended hereby (the "Term B1 Advances").

         (3) The Borrower desires to incur additional Term B1 Advances in an
amount equal to $100,000,000 in excess of the principal amount of Term B
Advances outstanding under the Credit Agreement prior to the effectiveness of
this Amendment No. 1.

         (4) Each Term B Lender who executes and delivers this Amendment No. 1
shall be deemed, upon the effectiveness of this Amendment No. 1, to have
converted its Term B Commitment and Term B Advances (which Term B Commitment
and Term B Advances shall thereafter be deemed terminated and refinanced in
full) for a Term B1 Commitment (as hereinafter defined) and Term B1 Advances,
respectively, with such Term B1 Commitment, in the same aggregate principal
amount as such Lender's outstanding Term B Advances, immediately prior to the
effectiveness of this Amendment No. 1, as set forth in Schedule I to the Credit
Agreement, as amended as of the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date (as hereinafter
defined) (the "Amended Schedule I") (a copy of which has been delivered to the
Borrower), and such Term B Lender shall thereafter become a Term B1 Lender (as
hereinafter defined).

         (5) Each Person who executes and delivers this Amendment No. 1 as an
additional Term B1 Lender (each, an "Additional Term B1 Lender"), will make
Term B1 Advances in the aggregate amount of its Additional Term B1 Commitment
(as hereinafter defined) on the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date (as hereinafter
defined) (each, an "Additional Term B1 Advance") to the Borrower in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the amount set forth opposite its name on
Amended Schedule I, the proceeds of which will be used by the Borrower, in
part, to refinance in full the outstanding principal amount of Term B Advances
of Term B Lenders, if any, who do not execute and deliver this Amendment No. 1,
it being understood that an Additional Term B1 Lender may be a Term B Lender
prior to the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date.

         (6) The Borrower shall pay to each Term B Lender all accrued and
unpaid interest on its Term B Advances to the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date on
such Amendment No. 1 Effective Date.

         (7) The Borrower has requested that the Required Lenders (a) waive

this Amendment No. 1, (ii) all references to "Term B Advances", "Term B
Commitment", "Term B Facility", "Term B Note", "Term B Lenders" and "Term B
Borrowings" in the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be references to "Term B1
Advances", "Total Term B1 Commitment", "Term B1 Facility", "Term B1 Note",

right, power or remedy of any Lender or any Agent under any of the Loan
Documents, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Loan
Documents.

         SECTION 9. Execution in Counterparts. This Amendment No. 1 may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in

by, and construed in accordance  with,  the laws of the State of New York, and

                      KCS Closes on Amended Credit Facility

Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City Southern ("KCS") (KSU:NYSE) announced today
that the company, its wholly owned subsidiary, The Kansas City Southern Railway
Company ("KCSR"), and certain of its subsidiaries had entered into an amendment
and waiver of its existing credit agreement. The credit agreement was amended
to, among other things, increase the term loan by $100,000,000 to a total amount
outstanding of $249,250,000 and decrease the borrowing spread by 25 basis points
to 175 basis points over LIBOR. In addition, a waiver was granted that would
allow KCSR to make an additional $55 million of capital expenditures during 2004
and 2005. The maturity date of the credit agreement remains unchanged.

The Bank of Nova Scotia and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. acted as joint
lead arrangers. The funds borrowed under the amended credit facility were
deposited into the Closing Escrow established under the terms of the December
15, 2004 Amended and Restated Acquisition Agreement.

                  KCS is comprised of, among others, The Kansas City Southern
Railway Company ("KCSR") and equity investments in Grupo TFM, Southern Capital
Corporation ("Southern Capital") and Panama Canal Railway Company ("PCRC").

This press release includes statements concerning potential future events

those factors identified in the "Risk Factors" and the "Cautionary Information"
sections of the Company's Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2003 filed

this press release to reflect future events or developments.
