                     THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF KCS AND TMM
                      APPROVE AMENDED ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

Kansas  City,  MO and Mexico  City,  Mexico,  December  15,  2004 - Kansas  City
Southern  (NYSE:  KSU) ("KCS") and Grupo TMM,  S.A.  (NYSE:  TMM and BMV: TMM A)
("TMM")  announced  today  that  the  companies  have  entered  into an  amended
acquisition  agreement  whereby TMM will sell its 51 percent voting  interest in
Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. ("Grupo TFM") to KCS for
$200 million in cash, 18 million  shares of KCS common  stock,  $47 million in a
two-year  promissory  note,  and up to $110 million  payable in a combination of
cash and KCS common stock upon successful  resolution of the current proceedings
related  to the VAT  Claim  and the Put with  the  Mexican  Government.  The $47
million  promissory  note and a portion of the $110 million  contingent  payment
will  be  subject   to   certain   escrow   arrangements   to  cover   potential
indemnification  claims. The boards of directors of both companies have approved
the transaction.

As part of the  transaction,  KCS will also enter into a  three-year  consulting
contract with a consulting firm controlled by Jose Serrano Segovia.  KCS and TMM
have also agreed that upon completion of the transaction all litigation  between
the two companies will be dismissed.

Consummation of the transaction  remains subject to the  satisfaction of certain
conditions,  including KCS shareholder approval.  TMM's controlling shareholders
have entered into a voting trust providing for approval of the transaction.

Both  the  Mexican  Foreign  Investment   Commission  and  the  Mexican  Federal
Competition  Commission have approved acquisition of the controlling interest in
TFM by KCS.  Although KCS and TMM previously  satisfied the  requirements of the
U.S.  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements Act of 1976, that authorization
has  expired  and the  parties  have  agreed  to file the  required  information
promptly with the U.S.  Department of Justice.  This  authorization  is required
prior to consummation of the transaction.

"We are very pleased to have entered into this amended  agreement  with TMM, and
believe it will enhance rail  competition  and give  shippers in the NAFTA trade
corridor a strong transportation alternative in this important and growing trade
corridor,"  said Michael R. Haverty,  chairman,  president  and chief  executive
officer of KCS. "This  transaction,  along with our recently approved control of
The Texas Mexican Railway Company, offers our shareholders greater value through
operating  efficiencies and  opportunities  that will come from common ownership
and control.  Our  customers,  both north and south of the border,  will benefit
from these efficiencies as well."

Jose Serrano, chairman and CEO of TMM said, "We're very pleased with the outcome
of the  transaction.  It creates  significant  value for all  shareholders.  The
combination of KCS and TFM creates an efficient  shipping route between the U.S.
and Mexico. TMM shareholders will continue to benefit from significant ownership
in this valuable  franchise.  The net cash proceeds of this  transaction will be
used by TMM to reduce its debt  obligations.  This  transaction  is truly in the
best  interests  of TMM  shareholders  and will  ensure  long  term  growth  and
flexibility at TMM."

Javier  Segovia,  president of TMM said,  "We are extremely  pleased to become a
significant  shareholder in KCS, a strong rail alternative  between the U.S. and
Mexico. TMM and TFM will continue to work closely,  and they have entered into a
marketing  agreement  to  further  our  shared  goals  of  providing  end-to-end
transportation for our customers.  In addition,  the sale of TFM to KCS puts TMM
on a superior financial footing".

TFM, S.A. de C.V., the operating subsidiary of Grupo TFM, and KCSR will continue
as  separate  corporations,  all  under the  common  control  of KCS.  Following
consummation of the transaction, KCS will continue to operate under the KCS name
and will maintain its headquarters in Kansas City,  Missouri.  Grupo TFM and TFM
will remain Mexican corporations,  with their corporate  headquarters located in
Mexico City. TFM holds the concession to operate  Mexico's  Northeast Rail Lines
through June 2047, and has the option to extend the concession for an additional
50 years.  The TFM rail  network  consists  of more than 2,600 miles of mainline
track. The combined system will exceed 5,300 miles of mainline track.
