          conversion   or   otherwise)   beneficial   ownership  of  any  Voting
          Securities),  if  after  any such  acquisition,  such  Person  and its

               (ii) make any public announcement with respect to any acquisition

          any purchase of a substantial portion of the

<PAGE>

          assets of KCS or its  Affiliates,  whether or not such proposal  might
          require the making of a public announcement by KCS;

               (iii) solicit,  initiate, make, or in any way participate in, any
          "solicitation"  of "proxies" to vote any Voting Securities or become a

          used in Regulation  14A under the Exchange Act, as such  Regulation is
          currently in effect,  disregarding clause (iv) of Rule 14a-1(1)(2) and
          including any exempt solicitation pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(1));

          annual or special meeting of stockholders or to a pledgee  pursuant to
          a pledge that complies with Section 3.6 of this Agreement;

               (vii) take any action which would be reasonably likely to require
          KCS to  make  a  public  announcement  regarding  any  of the  matters
          specified in this Section 2.1(a)(i)-(xi); or

               (viii)   initiate  or   participate   in  any   negotiations   or
          arrangements  with  any  third  party  with  respect  to  any  of  the
          foregoing,  or provide any  information or take any action designed to

               (x) make any  request in a public  manner or that  would  require

          representatives, employees, attorneys, advisors, agents or Affiliates)
          to waive, amend or modify any provisions of Section 2.1(a)(i)-(xi); or

               (xi) otherwise  act, alone or in concert with others,  to seek to

          policies of KCS.

          (b) TMM, TMMH, MM and each of the Principal  Stockholders covenants to
     and agrees  with KCS that such  Person  will  promptly  notify the Board of
     Directors of any serious  inquiry from any third party regarding any of the
     matters specified in Section

<PAGE>

     2.1(a)(i)-(xi)  (which notification shall include the identity of each such
     third party and the material  terms and  conditions of each such  inquiry).
     The Parties  acknowledge  that any such inquiry  made by a Competitor  or a
     representative of a Competitor shall be regarded as a serious inquiry.

     2.2 EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS.  If TMM, TMMH, MM, the Principal  Stockholders or
any of their respective  Affiliates owns or acquires beneficial ownership of any
Voting Securities of KCS in violation of Section  2.1(a)(i),  none of TMM, TMMH,
MM, the Principal Stockholders, nor any of their Affiliates shall be entitled to
vote,  or cause to be voted,  any Voting  Securities in excess of the greater of
(i) the level owned  immediately  prior to the acquisition of Voting  Securities
that  resulted  in the  violation  and (ii) the level  permitted  to be owned by
Section 2.1(a)(i), for any purposes (including, without limitation, with respect
to a  transaction  of any type or for the  election of  directors)  and shall be
deemed  thereby  to have  granted  to any  Person  designated  by the  Board  of
Directors an  irrevocable  proxy to vote such  securities  in  proportion to the
votes cast by all other  holders  of Voting  Securities  of KCS on such  matter;
PROVIDED,  that the right to vote such securities shall be reinstated,  and such
proxy  shall be deemed to be revoked,  upon the  earlier of (i) any  transfer of
such  securities  other than to an Affiliate of the  transferor  and that is not
otherwise in violation of this  Stockholders'  Agreement and (ii) the first date
on which the beneficial ownership of Voting Securities is reduced to the greater
of (x) the level owned immediately prior to the acquisition of Voting Securities
that resulted in the violation and (y) the level permitted by Section 2.1(a)(i).
KCS shall (as specified in Section 9.11) be entitled to enforce specifically the
terms of this  Section  2.2 and may also  pursue any other  available  remedy to
which it may be  entitled  as a result of any  violation  of this  Stockholders'
Agreement.

     2.3  TERMINATION.  The rights and  obligations  under this Article II shall
immediately and irrevocably terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) a Change
of Control of KCS,  or (ii) the first date the TMM Holders  beneficially  own in
the aggregate less than 15% of the outstanding  Voting  Securities of KCS for at
least 30 consecutive days.

     2.4 SECTION 203,  DELAWARE  GENERAL  CORPORATION  LAW. The  acquisition  of
Voting  Securities of KCS by any of the TMM Holders  pursuant to this Agreement,
the  Acquisition  Agreement or the Consulting  Agreement shall not be subject to
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Section 203"), but Section
203 shall remain  applicable to any other  acquisitions of Voting  Securities by
any of the TMM Holders.

                                  ARTICLE III.

     3.1 GENERAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS.  The TMM Holders shall not, directly
or indirectly,  alone or in concert with others, sell, assign, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate,  otherwise subject to any lien, grant any option with respect to or
otherwise   dispose  of  any   interest  in  (or  enter  into  an  agreement  or
understanding with respect to the foregoing) any Voting Securities  beneficially
owned by them (a  "Disposition"),  except in  accordance  with the terms of this
Stockholders' Agreement.

<PAGE>

     3.2 DISPOSITIONS TO COMPETITORS.

          (a) For a period of seven  years  after the  Effective  Date,  the TMM
     Holders shall not, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others,
     effect a Disposition to a Competitor; provided that no Disposition pursuant
     to a Public  Offering or a Rule 144  Transaction  will be deemed to violate
     this  prohibition if the selling TMM Holder(s) invoke and follow or require
     participating underwriters or brokers to invoke and follow, appropriate and
     reasonable  procedures  (subject to the prior  approval of KCS, which shall
     not be unreasonably  withheld)  designed to prevent the sale of such Voting
     Securities   to  any   Competitor.   The  Parties   agree  that  a  written
     representation  from the  purchaser or a  representative  of the  purchaser
     shall satisfy the requirements of appropriate and reasonable procedures set
     forth  in this  Section  3.2(a)  provided  such  representation  authorizes
     reliance  thereon by KCS and KCS has no reasonable  grounds to believe that
     such representation cannot be relied upon to satisfy such requirements.

          (b) After the  earliest of (i) seven  years  following  the  Effective
     Date,  or (ii) the first date on which the TMM  Holders  have  beneficially
     owned in the  aggregate,  directly or indirectly  and alone or as part of a
     Group,  less than 15% of the  outstanding  Voting  Securities of KCS for at
     least 30  consecutive  days (such earlier time being  referred to herein as
     the "ROFR Commencement Date"), any TMM Holder may sell Voting Securities to
     a Competitor so long as the procedures set forth in this Section 3.2(b) are
     followed.  If after  the ROFR  Commencement  Date the  selling  TMM  Holder
     proposes to sell Voting Securities to a Competitor (it being agreed that no
     Disposition pursuant to a Public Offering or a Rule 144 Transaction will be
     deemed to give rise to this right of first refusal),  then KCS shall have a
     right of first refusal.  If such a Disposition to a Competitor is proposed,
     the selling TMM Holder shall  deliver a written  notice to KCS advising KCS
     of the number of Voting Securities such holder desires to sell and the bona
     fide terms,  including price, of any such proposed  transaction.  KCS shall
     have the right (but not the  obligation)  to purchase,  in whole but not in
     part,  such Voting  Securities at a per share cash purchase  price equal to
     the  cash  purchase  price,  or on such  other  terms as  provided,  in the
     agreement  between  the selling  TMM Holder and a  Competitor.  In order to
     exercise its purchase rights  hereunder,  KCS must deliver a written notice
     to the seller to such  effect  within 10  business  days  after  receipt of
     written  notice of the proposed  sale. If KCS timely elects to purchase the
     Voting  Securities  specified in the notice, it shall complete the purchase
     within 60 days from the  delivery of such  notice,  unless a longer time is
     required to secure any  regulatory  approvals,  in which case the  purchase
     shall  occur on the  second  business  day  after the  receipt  of any such
     required   approvals,   which  approvals  shall  be  obtained  as  soon  as
     practicable.  Unless KCS exercises its right of first refusal by delivering
     written  notice to the selling TMM Holder  prior to the  expiration  of the
     offering period  described  above, the selling TMM Holder shall be entitled
     to sell such Voting Securities which KCS has not elected to purchase during
     the 120 days  following  such  expiration  on terms and  conditions no more
     favorable to the  purchasers  thereof than those offered to KCS. Any Voting
     Securities not so sold by the selling TMM Holder during such 120 day period
     may not  thereafter  be sold unless  again  offered to KCS  pursuant to the
     terms of this provision. This purchase right shall be assignable, in whole

<PAGE>

     or in  part,  by KCS to any  other  Person,  but no such  assignment  shall
     relieve KCS of its  obligation to assure  payment of the purchase price for
     any Voting  Securities  as to which a notice of election  to  exercise  the
     right of first refusal is made by KCS or any such assignee.

     3.3  DISPOSITIONS  TO  AFFILIATES.  For a period of seven  years  after the
Effective Date, each of the TMM Holders shall not, directly or indirectly, alone
or in concert with others,  effect a  Disposition  of Voting  Securities  to any
Affiliate of TMM,  TMMH, or MM or any  Affiliate of any  Principal  Stockholders
unless  such  Affiliate  agrees  in  writing  to be bound  by the  terms of this
Stockholders'   Agreement  and  provided  that  the  TMM  Holders  shall  remain
responsible,  jointly and  severally,  for any  breaches  of this  Stockholders'
Agreement by such  Affiliate  (provided that any TMM Holder which is a Principal
Stockholder shall be severally  responsible only for breaches by an Affiliate of
the  Principal  Stockholder  to  which  such  Principal  Stockholder  effects  a
Disposition).

     3.4 DISPOSITIONS TO CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Subject to the provisions of Sections
3.2 and  3.3,  the TMM  Holders  may  make a  Disposition  of any or all  Voting
Securities beneficially owned by such Person, provided that:

          (a) No  Disposition  (whether  in a single  transaction  or  series of
     transactions)  that  in  the  aggregate   represents  5%  or  more  of  the
     outstanding  Voting  Securities  shall be made to any Person  (other than a
     Permitted  Underwriter or an Affiliate  pursuant to and in accordance  with
     Section 3.3) other than a Person who is eligible to file  reports  pursuant
     to Rule 13d-1 under the  Exchange Act (a "13G  Filer"),  unless such Person
     would not be so eligible  with  respect to the Voting  Securities  acquired
     from the Disposition; and

          (b) No  Disposition  (whether  in a single  transaction  or  series of
     transactions) of Voting  Securities that in the aggregate  represents 5% or
     more of the outstanding  Voting  Securities  shall be made to any 13G Filer
     unless:

               (i) such 13G Filer would  continue to be eligible to file reports
          pursuant to Section  13(g) under the  Exchange Act with respect to the
          Voting  Securities after giving effect to the proposed  acquisition of
          such Voting Securities; and

               (ii) the selling TMM Holder shall have delivered a written notice
          to KCS  advising  KCS of the  number of Voting  Securities  the seller
          desires  to sell  and the  terms,  including  price,  of the  proposed
          transaction  and  KCS  has  been  provided  the  right  (but  not  the
          obligation) to purchase,  in whole or in part, such Voting  Securities
          at a per share cash  purchase  price equal to the purchase  price,  or
          upon such other terms as  provided,  in the proposed  transaction.  In
          order to exercise its purchase  rights  hereunder,  KCS must deliver a
          written  notice to the seller to such effect within five business days
          after  receipt  of  written  notice  of the  proposed  sale.  Upon the
          expiration of the offering  period  described  above,  the selling TMM
          Holder shall be entitled to sell such Voting  Securities which KCS

<PAGE>

          has not  elected  to  purchase  during  the 120  days  following  such
          expiration on terms and conditions no more favorable to the purchasers
          thereof than those offered to KCS. Any Voting  Securities  not so sold
          by the  selling  TMM  Holder  during  such  120  day  period  may  not
          thereafter  be sold unless again  offered to KCS pursuant to the terms
          of this provision.  This purchase right shall be assignable,  in whole
          or in part, by KCS to any other Person,  but no such assignment  shall
          relieve KCS of its  obligation to assure payment of the purchase price
          for any Voting Securities as to which KCS has delivered such a written
          notice.

          (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section  3.4(a) and (b),  no
     Disposition  (whether in a single  transaction or a series of transactions)
     shall be made to any  Person  or  Group  that  would,  together  with  such
     Person's   Affiliates  and  Associates  and  after  giving  effect  to  the
     acquisition of such Voting  Securities,  beneficially own or have the right
     to acquire more than 15% of the Total Voting Power.

     3.5  DISPOSITIONS  OF HOLDERS OF VOTING  SECURITIES.  For a period of seven
years after the Effective  Date, no TMM Holder  shall,  directly or  indirectly,
alone or in concert with others, sell, assign,  transfer,  pledge,  hypothecate,
otherwise  subject to any lien,  grant any option with  respect to or  otherwise
dispose of any  interest in (or enter into an agreement  or  understanding  with
respect to the foregoing)  any capital stock or Voting  Securities or control of
any Person that, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns any Voting Securities
of KCS to a Competitor, except as permitted by Section 3.3.

     3.6 PLEDGES.  Subject to the provisions  contained herein, a TMM Holder may
pledge or hypothecate as security for any indebtedness or other  obligations any
or all Voting  Securities  beneficially  owned by such Person provided that such
TMM Holder obtains prior to such pledge or  hypothecation  written  consent from
the  pledgee  that upon the  occurrence  of an event which gives the pledgee the
right to foreclose on the pledged Voting Securities  ("Foreclosure  Event") such
pledgee shall provide to KCS prompt written notice of such Foreclosure Event and
provide KCS the right to  purchase  such Voting  Securities  at a cash  purchase
price equal to the average  closing  price of KCS's Common Stock on the New York
Stock  Exchange  over the five  consecutive  trading days  preceding the date of
receipt of the notice of the pending  foreclosure sale. In order to exercise its
purchase rights  hereunder,  KCS must deliver a written notice to the pledgee to
such effect within five  business  days after  receipt of written  notice of the
Foreclosure Event and complete such purchase within 60 days from the delivery of
such notice unless a longer time is required to secure any regulatory approvals,
in which case the  purchase  shall  occur on the second  business  day after the
receipt of any such required approvals. This purchase right shall be assignable,
in whole or in part, by KCS to any other Person,  but no such  assignment  shall
relieve KCS of its  obligation to assure  payment of the purchase  price for any
Voting Securities as to which KCS has delivered such a written notice.

     3.7  EFFECT OF  NON-COMPLIANCE.  Any  attempted  Disposition  of any Voting
Securities in violation of any provision of this  Stockholders'  Agreement shall
be void,  and KCS shall not record  such  Disposition  on its books or treat any
purported  transferee of such Voting  Securities

<PAGE>

as the owner of such  shares  for any  purpose,  including  without  limitation,
voting,  receiving dividends or other distributions and being entitled to any of
the benefits of this Stockholders' Agreement.

     3.8  PERMITTED   DISPOSITIONS  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  CERTAIN  TRANSACTIONS.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Article III, the TMM Holders  shall be
permitted to make a Disposition in connection  with any tender or exchange offer
made by an  unaffiliated  third party to acquire KCS Common Stock so long as the
following  conditions  are satisfied (i) the TMM Holders are in compliance  with
the provisions of Section 2.1(a) with respect to such tender or exchange  offer;
(ii) such tender or  exchange  offer must be for all of the  outstanding  Voting
Securities;  (iii) the offeror  shall have made a commitment  to effect a merger

consideration  being provided to the holders of the  securities  tendered in the
tender  offer;  (iv) the holders of a majority of the Voting  Securities of KCS,
other than the Voting Securities  beneficially  owned by the TMM Holders,  shall
have tendered their Voting Securities  pursuant to such tender or exchange offer
and such Voting  Securities  shall not have been  withdrawn;  (v) such tender or
exchange offer shall not be subject to any financing condition; and (vi) the TMM
Holders may not tender, or publicly disclose their intention to tender, prior to
the business day immediately preceding the scheduled expiration of the tender or
exchange offer.

     3.9   TERMINATION.   Except  for  Section   3.2(b)   (which  shall  survive
indefinitely),   the  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Article  III  shall
immediately and irrevocably terminate:

               (i) on the first  date the TMM  Holders  beneficially  own in the
          aggregate less than 15% of the  outstanding  Voting  Securities of KCS
          for at least 30 consecutive days; or

               (ii) a Change of Control of KCS.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

                               PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

     4.1 PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS.

          (a) Subject to Section  4.1(d)  below,  except for issuances of Common
     Stock (including for this purpose,  options,  warrants and other securities
     convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) issued:

               (i)  to  KCS's   employees,   directors,   consultants,   agents,
          independent  contractors or other service providers in connection with
          a Plan  existing on the date hereof or a Plan approved by the Board of
          Directors and adopted by KCS after the date hereof;

               (ii) upon the exercise of any options,  warrants,  convertible or
          exchangeable securities which are outstanding as of the date hereof;

<PAGE>

               (iii)  in   connection   with   the   acquisition   (by   merger,
          consolidation, acquisition of assets or equity interests or otherwise)
          of the equity interests or assets of another Person; or

               (iv) issued pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement,  the Ancillary
          Agreements, or the Consulting Agreement;

     if KCS authorizes the issuance or sale of any shares of Common Stock or any
     securities  containing  options or rights to  acquire  any shares of Common
     Stock (other than as a dividend on the outstanding Common Stock), KCS shall
     first notify TMM Holders of such proposed  transaction and offer to sell to
     each such  Person a number of shares of Common  Stock (or,  as  applicable,
     options,  warrants or other securities  convertible into or exercisable for
     Common Stock) equal to the product  obtained by  multiplying  the number of
     shares  of  Common  Stock or  securities  containing  options  or rights to
     acquire  Common Stock  authorized to be sold by KCS by a fraction,  (1) the
     numerator  of which is the number of shares of Common  Stock  owned by such
     Person   and  (2)  the   denominator   of  which   is  the   total  of  all
     then-outstanding  Voting  Securities.  Each TMM Holder shall be entitled to
     purchase such Common Stock (or, as applicable,  options,  warrants or other
     securities  convertible  into or exercisable  for Common Stock) at the same
     price and on the same terms and  conditions  as such  Common  Stock (or, as
     applicable,  options,  warrants  or other  securities  convertible  into or
     exercisable  for Common Stock) are to be offered to any other  Persons.  To
     the  extent  that  any  TMM  Holder  elects  not  to  participate  in  such
     pre-emptive  rights,  each of the other TMM  Holders  shall  have a prorata
     right to  purchase  at the same price and on the same terms and  conditions
     the Voting Securities which such non-participating TMM Holder had the right
     but elected not to purchase;  provided that the exercise of such right does
     not extend the time for  written  notice set forth in Section  4.1(b).  The
     purchase  price for all stock and  securities  offered to such TMM  Holders
     shall be payable in cash or, to the extent that other payment is to be made
     by the other  Persons to whom stock or securities  are so offered,  on such
     other payment terms.

          (b) In order to exercise its purchase rights  hereunder,  a TMM Holder
     must  deliver a written  notice to KCS to such effect  within ten  business
     days after  receipt of written  notice from KCS  describing  in  reasonable
     detail the stock or securities  being offered,  the purchase price thereof,
     the payment terms, such holder's  percentage  allotment,  and the number of
     shares of Common  Stock (or,  as  applicable,  options,  warrants  or other
     securities  convertible  into or exercisable  for Common Stock) such holder
     has the right to purchase hereunder.

          (c) Upon the expiration of the offering period  described  above,  KCS
     shall be entitled to sell such stock or  securities  which such TMM Holders
     have not elected to purchase  during the 120 days following such expiration
     on terms and conditions no more  favorable to the  purchasers  thereof than
     those offered to such TMM Holders.  Any stock or securities  not so sold by
     KCS during  such 120 day period may not  thereafter  be sold  unless  again
     offered to the TMM Holders pursuant to the terms of this Article IV.

<PAGE>

          (d)  The  rights  of the TMM  Holders  under  this  Article  IV  shall

     40% of the Voting  Securities  initially  acquired  by MM  pursuant  to the
     Acquisition  Agreement;  or (ii) the date that is three (3) years following
     the date hereof.

vote in the election of directors  (i) in favor of all Persons  nominated by the
Nominating  Committee  for election as a member of the Board of Directors by the
holders of Common  Stock;  and (ii)  against any proposal to remove any director
nominated by the  Nominating  Committee and elected to the Board of Directors by
the  holders  of  Common  Stock;  and each  such  holder  shall  take all  other
reasonably necessary or desirable actions within its control (including, without
limitation,  attendance  at  meetings  in  person or by proxy  for  purposes  of
obtaining a quorum and  execution  of written  consents in lieu of  meetings) to
cause such actions to be taken.

          CONDITIONS OF SUCH STOCKHOLDERS'  AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN COMPLIED WITH IN
          FULL AND NO PERSON  MAY  REQUEST  KCS TO RECORD  THE  TRANSFER  OF ANY
          SHARES  IF  SUCH  TRANSFER  IS  IN  VIOLATION  OF  SUCH  STOCKHOLDERS'

     9.12 GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

          (a)  Resolution of any and all disputes  between KCS, on the one hand,
     and one or more of TMM,  TMMH, MM, the Principal  Stockholders,  and any of
     their  respective  Affiliates  on the other hand,  (each of KCS, on the one
     hand,  and TMM,  TMMH,  MM,  the  Principal  Stockholders,  or any of their
     respective  Affiliates,  on the other hand, a "Dispute  Party" and, both of
     KCS, on the one hand, and TMM, TMMH, MM, the Principal Stockholders, or any
     of their respective  Affiliates,  on the other hand, the "Dispute Parties")
     arising  from or in  connection  with this  Stockholders'  Agreement or any
     transactions contemplated by this Stockholders' Agreement, whether based on
     contract,  tort,  common  law,  equity,  statute,   regulation,   order  or
     otherwise,  ("Disputes"),  including  Disputes  arising in connection  with
     claims by third Persons,  shall be  exclusively  governed by and settled in
     accordance  with the  provisions of this Section 9.12;  provided,  that the
     foregoing shall not preclude  equitable or other judicial relief to enforce
     the provisions  hereof or to preserve the status quo pending  resolution of
     Disputes hereunder.

          (b) THIS AGREEMENT, THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO AND
     THE  ADJUDICATION  AND  ENFORCEMENT  THEREOF,  SHALL  BE  GOVERNED  BY  AND
     INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE  SUBSTANTIVE  LAWS OF THE
     STATE OF  DELAWARE  AND THE FEDERAL  LAWS OF THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA,
     WITHOUT REGARD TO APPLICABLE CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS.

          (c) As to any Dispute which is not resolved in the ordinary  course of
     business, the Dispute Parties shall first attempt in good faith to promptly
     resolve  any  Dispute by  negotiations  between  executives.  Either of the
     Dispute  Parties may initiate this  procedure by delivery of written notice
     of the Dispute (the "Dispute  Notice") to the other. Not later than 20 days
     after delivery of the Dispute  Notice,  one executive of one of the Dispute
     Parties with  authority to settle the Dispute shall meet with one executive
     of the other  Dispute  Party  with  authority  to settle  the  Dispute at a
     reasonably  acceptable  time and place,  and thereafter as such  executives
     shall deem reasonably  necessary.  The executives  shall exchange  relevant
     information and endeavor to resolve the Dispute. Prior to any such meeting,
     each Dispute Party's executive shall advise the other as to any individuals
     who will attend such meeting with the executive.  All negotiations pursuant
     to this  Section  9.12(c)  shall be  confidential  and shall be  treated as
     compromise

<PAGE>

     negotiations  for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
     similarly under other local or foreign rules of evidence.

          (d) Each  Dispute  Party  hereby  agrees to submit  all  Disputes  not
     resolved   pursuant  to  Section   9.12(c)  hereof  to  final  and  binding
     arbitration in New York,  New York.  Either Dispute Party may initiate such
     arbitration by delivery of a demand therefor (the "Arbitration  Demand") to
     the other  Dispute Party not sooner than 60 days after the date of delivery
     of the Dispute Notice but promptly thereafter;  provided, that if a Dispute
     Party  rejects  participation  in the  procedures  provided  under  Section
     9.12(c),  the other Dispute Party may initiate  arbitration at such earlier
     time as such rejection  shall become  reasonably  apparent,  and,  whenever
     arbitration  is  initiated,  may seek  recovery  of any damages or expenses
     arising from such rejection,  including  attorney's fees and expenses,  and
     Arbitration  Costs  (as  defined  below)  in  connection  with  arbitration
     hereunder.

               (i) Three Arbitrators shall be appointed (the "Arbitrators"), one
          of whom shall be  appointed by KCS, one by TMM, and the third of whom,
          who shall  act as the  chairman  of the  arbitral  tribunal,  shall be
          appointed by the first two Arbitrators  within 10 business days of the
          first  two  Arbitrators   confirmation  by  the  American  Arbitration
          Association.   Each  Party  agrees  that  the  TMM  Holders  shall  be
          considered jointly as one side for the purposes of constitution of the
          arbitration  tribunal  hereunder.  If either  Dispute  Party  fails to
          appoint an Arbitrator  within 10 business days of a request in writing
          by the other  Dispute  Party to do so or if the first two  Arbitrators
          cannot  agree on the  appointment  of the third  Arbitrator  within 10
          business  days  of  their  confirmation  by the  American  Arbitration
          Association,  then such Arbitrator  shall be appointed by the American
          Arbitration  Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
          Rules.  As soon as the  arbitration  tribunal  has  been  convened,  a
          hearing date shall be set within 15 days  thereafter;  provided,  that
          the Arbitrators may extend the date of the hearing upon request of any
          Dispute  Party to the extent  necessary  to insure  that such  Dispute
          Party is given a reasonable period of time to prepare for the hearing.
          Written  submittals  in the English  language  shall be presented  and
          exchanged  by both  Dispute  Parties  five  business  days  before the
          hearing  date.  At such time the Dispute  Parties  shall also exchange
          copies of all  documentary  evidence  upon which they will rely at the
          arbitration  hearing and a list of the  witnesses  whom they intend to
          call to  testify  at the  hearing.  The  Arbitrators  shall make their
          determination  as  promptly as  practicable  after  conclusion  of the
          hearing.

               (ii) The arbitration  shall be conducted in the English  language
          pursuant  to  the  Commercial   Arbitration   Rules  of  the  American
          Arbitration  Association.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  (A)  each
          Dispute  Party  shall have the right to audit the books and records of
          the other  Dispute Party that are  reasonably  related to the Dispute;
          (B) each  Dispute  Party  shall  provide to the other,  reasonably  in
          advance of any hearing,  copies of all documents which a Dispute Party
          intends  to  present  in such  hearing;  (C)  all  hearings  shall  be
          conducted on an expedited  schedule;  and (D) all proceedings shall be
          confidential, except that either Dispute Party may at its expense make
          a stenographic record thereof.

               (iii) The Arbitrators shall endeavor to complete all hearings not
          later than 120 days after their tribunal has been convened,  and shall
          make a final award as promptly as

<PAGE>

          practicable thereafter. Such award shall be communicated,  in writing,
          by the Arbitrators to the Dispute Parties,  and shall contain specific
          findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of law in  accordance  with  the
          governing  law set forth in  Section  9.12(b) of this  Agreement.  Any
          award of such Arbitrators  shall be final and binding upon the Parties
          to this  Agreement  and shall not be attacked by any of the Parties to
          this  Agreement  in any court of law and may be  enforced in any court
          having  jurisdiction,  including  expressly the courts of the State of
          New York,  United  States of  America,  and the courts of the  Federal
          District of Mexico.  The  Arbitrators  shall  apportion  all costs and
          expenses  of the  arbitration,  including  the  Arbitrators'  fees and
          expenses,  fees and  expenses  of  experts  and fees and  expenses  of
          translators   ("Arbitration   Costs")   between  the   prevailing  and
          non-prevailing  Dispute Party as the  Arbitrators  shall deem fair and
          reasonable.  In circumstances where (A) a Dispute has been asserted or
          defended  against  on grounds  that the  Arbitrators  deem  manifestly
          unreasonable,  or (B) the  non-prevailing  Dispute  Party has rejected
          participation in procedures under Section 9.12(c), the Arbitrators may
          assess all Arbitration Costs against the non-prevailing  Dispute Party
          and may include in the award the prevailing Dispute Party's attorney's
          fees and expenses in  connection  with any and all  proceedings  under
          this Section 9.12.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the
          arbitrator award multiple or punitive damages.

          (e)  Pursuant  to an  agreement  of the  Parties  hereto or a judicial
     determination   that  a  Dispute  is  not  subject  to  final  and  binding
     arbitration  as set forth in Section  9.12(d),  KCS, TMM,  TMMH, MM and the
     Principal  Stockholders  each  irrevocably  agrees that any legal action or
     proceeding against it with respect to this Stockholders'  Agreement and any
     transaction  contemplated by this Stockholders'  Agreement shall be brought
     only in the courts of the State of New York,  or of  Federal  courts of the
     United States of America sitting in New York, and by execution and delivery
     of this Stockholders'  Agreement,  KCS and each of TMM Holders  irrevocably
     submits to the venue and  jurisdiction  of each such court and  irrevocably
     waives any  objection  or defense  such Party may have to venue or personal
     jurisdiction  in any such  court for the  purpose of  resolving  any claim,
     dispute,  cause of action  arising out of or related to this  Stockholders'
     Agreement  (including any claim that the suit or action has been brought in
     an  inconvenient  forum and any right to which it may  become  entitled  on
     account of place of  residence  or  domicile),  the alleged  breach of this
     Stockholders' Agreement, the enforcement of the terms of this Stockholders'
     Agreement,  the  Acquisition  Agreement,  the Ancillary  Agreements and the
     other terms contemplated  hereby and thereby. A final judgment in any suit,
     action or proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in any court
     where  jurisdiction over the Parties may be had or in which the Parties are
     subject to service of process.

          (f) Each of the Parties  hereto  irrevocably  appoints CT  Corporation
     (the "Process Agent"), at 1209 Orange Street,  Wilmington,  Delaware, 19801
     (telephone  302-658-7581) as its agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact
     in its name, place and stead to accept on behalf of each of the parties and
     their respective properties and revenues,  service of copies of the summons
     and  complaint  and any other process which may be served in any such suit,
     action or  proceeding  brought  in the  State of New York,  and each of the
     Parties  hereto agrees that failure of the Process Agent to give any notice
     of any such  service  of  process to any of the  Parties  hereto  shall not
     impair or affect the  validity of such  service or the  enforcement  of any
     judgment based thereon.

     9.13  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  KCS and TMM  shall  consult  with each  other  before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment on and concur
with,  any  press  release  or  other  public  statement  with  respect  to this
Stockholders'  Agreement,  except  as KCS  or TMM  may  determine  is  otherwise
required by Applicable Law, judicial or administrative action or any requirement
of the  Mexican  Stock  Exchange,  the New  York  Stock  Exchange  or any  other
applicable self-regulatory organization.

     9.14 COOPERATION ON TMM  DISTRIBUTION.  KCS  acknowledges  that holders may
desire  to  effect  a  distribution  of  the  shares  of  Common  Stock  to  the
stockholders of TMM in a tax efficient manner (a "Spin-Off").  In the event that
TMM determines to effect a Spin-Off,  KCS will, and will cause its  subsidiaries
to,  take  commercially   reasonable  efforts  to  cooperate  with  TMM  in  the
consummation of the Spin-Off.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
if requested by TMM, KCS agrees to use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
effect the Spin-Off  Merger (as defined below) as promptly as practicable  after
receipt from TMM of notice of its intention to effect such Spin-Off Merger.  TMM
shall cooperate  fully with KCS, and shall reimburse KCS, for any  out-of-pocket
expenses that KCS incurs in connection with the Spin-Off  Merger,  including the
reasonable fees and expenses of KCS's counsel (other than any such expenses that
constitute   Registration  Expenses  (as  defined  in  the  Registration  Rights
Agreement) in the event that the Spin-Off Merger requires registration under the
Securities  Act (in which  case such  registration  shall  reduce by one (1) the
number of  registrations  required to be effected by KCS under  Section 2 of the
Registration  Rights  Agreement)) and shall indemnify and hold KCS harmless from
and against all costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever  (including taxes in
connection  therewith)  resulting  from,  arising out of, or due to, directly or
indirectly,  the Spin-Off Merger (other than with respect to matters as to which
KCS is  obligated  to  provide  indemnification  under the  Registration  Rights
Agreement).

     For purposes of this  Agreement,  the term  "Spin-Off  Merger" shall mean a
transaction  occurring  prior to that date which shall be one year following the
Effective  Time  (as  defined  in the  Acquisition  Agreement)  in  which  (i) a
newly-formed  entity  organized  under the laws of the UMS whose assets  consist
solely  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock  ("Holdco")  and the stock of which is
distributed  to the  holders of capital  stock of TMM is merged  with and into a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of KCS and, in such merger,  the outstanding  shares of
capital  stock of  Holdco  are  converted  into the  right  to  receive,  in the
aggregate,  a number of shares of Common  Stock equal to the number of shares of
Common  Stock held by Holdco;  (ii) Holdco  shall not have any  indebtedness  or
other obligations (other than any obligations related solely to its organization
and the holding of the shares of Common Stock, which obligations TMM shall agree
to indemnify KCS against pursuant to an indemnity agreement satisfactory in form
and  substance  to KCS and  TMM);  (iii) KCS and its  subsidiaries  shall not be
required to assume or become liable for any other liabilities as a result of the
Spin-Off  Merger (other than any  obligations or liabilities  resulting from the
registration  of the shares of Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant to the Spin-Off
Merger);  and (iv) KCS shall be reasonably  satisfied that the transaction  will
not  affect  adversely  in any  material  way  any  rights  of KCS or any of its
Affiliates under the Acquisition  Agreement or any of the Ancillary  Agreements,
including without limitation,  rights to receive any indemnification  determined
to be due thereunder.
