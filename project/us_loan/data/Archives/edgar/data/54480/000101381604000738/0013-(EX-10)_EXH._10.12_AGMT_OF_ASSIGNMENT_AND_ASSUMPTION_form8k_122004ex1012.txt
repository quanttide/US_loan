     de C. V., represented in this act by Lic. Mario Mohar Ponce and Mr. Michael
     R. Haverty.

In  consideration  of  and  in  conformity  with  the  following   recitals  and
agreements:



RECITALS

1.   On January 31, 1997,  the Federal  Government of the United  Mexican States
     (the  "GOVERNMENT")  and GTFM  entered  into an  agreement  (the  "PURCHASE
     AGREEMENT") for the purchase of 80% of the capital stock of the Ferrocarril
     del Noreste, S.A. de C.V., currently known as TFM, S.A. de C.V. ("TFM");

2.   Pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreement,  the  Government  retained 20% of the
     capital stock of TFM,  represented by Class III limited voting shares, with
     the Government  retaining the option under the Purchase Agreement to all or
     a portion of those shares to the public,  and in accordance  with the terms
     of the  Purchase  Agreement to sell any shares not sold to the public prior
     to the date fixed in the Purchase  Agreement to GTFM at a price  determined
     by the formula stated in the Purchase Agreement (the "PUT Shares");

3.   On June 9,  1997,  the  Government,  GTFM,  GTMM  and KCS  entered  into an
     amendment of the Purchase  Agreement  (hereinafter,  the "PUT  AGREEMENT"),
     through which,  among other  matters,  the term during which the Government
     may sell the Put Shares to the public and  require  GTFM to acquire the Put
     Shares was extended, and GTMM and KCS jointly and severally agreed with the
     Government in Section 3.02 of the Put Agreement that in the event that GTFM
     did not  acquire  the Put  Shares in  accordance  with the terms of the Put
     Agreement, GTMM and KCS would be jointly and severally obligated to acquire
     the Put Shares;

<PAGE>

4.   In  May  1997,   GTMM  and  KCS,  and  certain  of  their   affiliates  and
     subsidiaries,   entered  into  a  Shareholders   Agreement   ("SHAREHOLDERS
     AGREEMENT")   that   included,   among   other   provisions,   Section   7,
     Indemnification,   which  created   rights,   duties  and   obligations  of
     indemnification between GTMM and KCS with respect to the Put Shares;

5.   On October 31, 2003, the Ministry of Communications and Transportation (the
     "SCT")  purported  through  official  letter  4.620  to  notify  TFM of the
     existence of the  obligation to purchase the Put Shares,  and GTFM, TMM and
     KCS were advised of that purported notification;

6.   As GTFM  and  TFM  believe  that  the  Government  has  not  satisfied  its
     obligations  under the Purchase  Agreement and the Put Agreement,  and that
     the purported  notification by the SCT of TFM of the obligation to purchase
     the Put Shares was  defective,  GTFM and TFM filed on  October  16,  2003 a
     lawsuit, case number 166/2003-V (the "PUT LAWSUIT"), naming the Treasury of
     the Mexican Federation, the SCT, the General Attorney of the United Mexican
     States as  necessary  parties,  and  seeking a judicial  interpretation  of
     GTFM's  and TFM's  obligations  under the  Purchase  Agreement  and the Put
     Agreement.  TMM and KCS,  among  others,  were called to the Put Lawsuit as
     interested third parties;

7.   GTFM and TFM filed on November 26, 2003 a  constitutional  appeal  (AMPARO,
     the  "AMPARO"),  case  number  1628/2003,   against  the  Treasury  of  the
     Federation,  the SCT, and the General Attorney of the United Mexican States
     with respect to official  letter 4.620 of October 31, 2003,  which resulted
     in an injunction being issued against the defendants;

8.   The  Government  has  indicated  that it may  file  additional  proceedings
     against  GTFM,  TFM,  GTMM and KCS related to the Put Agreement and the VAT
     Claim;

9.   GTMM and KCS  have  entered  into  the  Amended  and  Restated  Acquisition
     Agreement by and among KCS, KARA Sub,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation,  GTMM
     and certain other parties (the "ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"); and

10.  Pursuant to the Acquisition  Agreement,  the Shareholders Agreement and all
     rights,  duties and obligations  arising from the  Shareholders  Agreement,
     including  Section 7 thereof,  shall  terminate  and shall be of no further
     force  and  effect  as of  the  Closing  (as  defined  in  the  Acquisition
     Agreement).

AGREEMENTS

For good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency  of which is
hereby acknowledged,  the parties hereto,  intending to be legally bound hereby,
agree as follows:

1)   ASSIGNMENT  AND  ASSUMPTION  OF PUT  OBLIGATION.  GTMM  hereby  irrevocably
     assigns  and  transfers  to KCS,  and KCS hereby  irrevocably  accepts  and
     assumes,  all of GTMM's rights,  duties and obligations with respect to the
     purchase  of the Put Shares  under the Put  Agreement,  effective  upon the
     Closing of the Acquisition.

<PAGE>

2)   PURCHASE RIGHT. In the event that following Closing of the Acquisition GTFM
     or GTMM are required to purchase the Put Shares held by the  Government (or
     any person to which the Government delegates, transfers or assigns any such
     Put Shares and/or the Put Option),  including upon final determination that
     either of them is required to purchase  the Put Shares  pursuant to the Put
     Agreement, KCS or its designee shall purchase, in accordance with the terms
     of the Put  Agreement  all of the Put  Shares  that  GTMM  would  have been
     required to purchase  pursuant  to the Put  Agreement..  KCS shall have the
     right to cause any KCS  subsidiary  to  purchase  the Put  Shares or it may
     designate another party to be the purchaser of the Put Shares,  but no such
     designation  shall relieve KCS of its  obligation to pay the purchase price
     for such Put Shares or to indemnify any person under Section 5 hereof.

3)   PAYMENT  OF  PURCHASE  PRICE;  NON-ASSIGNABLE   OBLIGATIONS;   AGENCY  WITH
     UNDISCLOSED  PRINCIPAL  AGREEMENT.  In the event that,  notwithstanding the
     provisions of Section 2, GTMM is legally required  following Closing of the
     Acquisition  to purchase  the Put Shares then KCS shall  provide  GTMM with
     immediately  available  funds  sufficient to purchase the Put Shares and to
     pay all costs and expenses  associated  with such purchase  (including  any
     taxes that may become  payable in connection  with such purchase) not later
     than three (3) business days prior to the date of such  purchase,  and GTMM
     shall  purchase  such Put  Shares on  behalf  of KCS,  but in its own name,
     pursuant to Articles  2560 and 2561 of the Federal Civil Code of the United
     Mexican States.  Transfer of such amount shall not affect KCS'  obligations
     under  Section 6 of this  Agreement.  Once GTMM  acquires the PUT Shares on
     behalf  of KCS,  but in its own  name,  it  shall  immediately  endorse  in
     property the relevant certificates in favor of KCS or its designee.

     Pursuant to Article  2596 of the Federal  Civil Code of the United  Mexican
     States,  GTMM hereby  irrevocably  agrees not to renounce  the  obligations
     assumed in this  Section 3, to act as  undisclosed  agent  (MANDATARIO  SIN
     REPRESENTACION) of KCS.



4)   CONTROL AND  MANAGEMENT  OF  LITIGATION.  Following  the Closing  under the
     Acquisition  Agreement,  KCS  shall  have the sole and  exclusive  right to
     control  any and all  litigation  related to the Put  Agreement,  including
     without limitation the Put Lawsuit and the Amparo. For such purposes,  GTMM
     hereby  agrees to grant,  within 10 (ten)  business  days after the Closing
     under the Acquisition Agreement,  an irrevocable power of attorney in favor
     of KCS for lawsuits and  collections  (PLEITOS Y COBRANZAS)  limited to (i)
     the Put Lawsuit,  (ii) the Amparo,  in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit
     "A",  and (iii) and any other  litigation  related to or derived  from this
     litigation.



5)   INDEMNIFICATION.  KCS shall following Closing of the Acquisition indemnify,
     defend and hold  harmless  GTMM and its  Affiliates,  and their  respective
     officers, directors,  employees and shareholders,  from and against any and
     all   losses,   damages,   liabilities,   claims,   demands,   obligations,
     deficiencies,  payments, judgments,  settlements,

<PAGE>

     costs  and  expenses  of any  nature  whatsoever  (including  the costs and
     expenses  of any  and  all  investigations,  actions,  suits,  proceedings,
     demands,  assessments,   judgments,  orders,  settlements  and  compromises
     relating thereto),  and reasonable attorneys',  accountants',  experts' and
     other fees and expenses in connection  therewith ("LOSSES") resulting from,
     arising  out of or due  directly  to KCS'  failure to fully  discharge  the
     obligations  of GTMM and KCS under the Put  Agreement,  including,  without
     limitation, KCS' failure to purchase, when required by the Government to do
     so in accordance with the Put Agreement,  the Put Shares or any requirement
     to fund amounts to GTFM to permit GTFM to purchase the Put Shares; provided
     that KCS may set off against  and reduce the amount of any  indemnification
     obligation  under  this  paragraph  by the  amount  of any  indemnification
     obligation  of GTMM  pursuant to Article 10 of the  Acquisition  Agreement,
     except  with  respect  to any  indemnification  obligations  of GTFM  under
     Sections 10.2(a)(i) or (a)(ii), which amounts may not be offset.

6)   REMEDIES.  Subject to the provisions contemplated in this Agreement: (a) in
     the event  that one  party  materially  fails to  perform  its  obligations
     pursuant  to  this  Agreement,  the  other  party  may  bring  any  action,
     proceeding  or  court  action  seeking  (i)  specific  performance  of  the
     obligations  of the party in default  hereunder,  which the parties  hereto
     agree shall be available to the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, (ii)
     damages  as a result  of any  such  failure  to  perform  pursuant  to this
     Agreement,  with the parties  hereto  agreeing  that damages to the damaged
     party arising as a result of any material  breach by the part in default of
     its obligations  hereunder shall be recoverable by them in any such action,
     and/or (iii) any other remedy  available  under  applicable law; and (b) to
     the extent  permitted  by  applicable  law,  all of the  remedies set forth
     herein  and  or  the  Acquisition  Agreement  or at law  shall  be  equally
     available to each of the parties hereto.

7)   NOTIFICATION. GTMM shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify
     KCS of any  notifications  given  to  GTMM  under  or  concerning  the  Put
     Agreement.

8)   INCORPORATION  OF PARTS OF THE  AGREEMENT.  Article  12 of the  Acquisition
     Agreement is hereby  incorporated  MUTATIS MUTANDIS into and made a part of
     this  Agreement.  Defined terms used in this Agreement not defined  herein,
     shall  have  the  meanings  ascribed  to  those  terms  in the  Acquisition
     Agreement.

IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Parties  have caused this  Agreement to be executed by
their authorized representatives of the date first above written.

                                           FORM OF IRREVOCABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY



           IRREVOCABLE SPECIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY

The Undersigned,  Mr. [*], appearing on behalf of Grupo TMM,

obligation  of the  Principal  to purchase all of the shares
owned  by the  Federal  Government  in  TFM,  S.A.  de  C.V.
("TFM"),  including,  without  limitation:  (i) Case  number
166/2003-V,  initiated by Grupo  Transportacion  Ferroviaria     [Spanish
Mexicana,  S.A.  de C.V.  ("GTFM"),  and TFM, on October 16,     language
2003,  naming the  Treasury of the Mexican  Federation,  the     version of
Ministry of Communications  and  Transportation  (SECRETARIA     Irrevocable
DE  COMUNICACIONES  Y  TRANSPORTES  or "SCT"),  the  General     Power of
Attorney of the Mexican Republic as necessary  parties;  and     Attorney]
(ii) the  constitutional  appeal (AMPARO)  initiated by GTFM
