     2. REQUIRED REGISTRATIONS.

     (A) Subject to the terms of this Registration  Rights  Agreement,  upon the
written  request (the "Request") to register any number of shares of Registrable
Stock  under  the  Securities  Act  made at any  time  prior  to the  five  year
anniversary  of the  Effective  Date of this  Registration  Rights  Agreement by
Holders of not less than 10% of the shares of Registrable  Stock  specifying the
intended method of disposition  thereof,  KCS will use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to effect the registration of Registrable Stock under the Securities Act
for disposition in accordance with the intended method of disposition  stated in
the Request,  to the extent  requisite to permit the  disposition (in accordance
with the intended method set forth in the Request) of the  Registrable  Stock to
be so  registered,  but  only  to the  extent  provided  for  in  the  following
provisions of this Registration Rights Agreement.  Whenever KCS shall,  pursuant
to this Section 2(A), be requested to effect the registration of any Registrable
Stock under the Securities  Act, KCS shall,  within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of the Request, give written notice of such proposed registration to all
Holders  of  Registrable  Stock,  stating  that such  Holders  have the right to
request  that any or all of the  Registrable  Stock owned by them be included in
such  registration  and specifying the intended filing date of the  Registration
Statement  relating  to such  Request  (which  date  shall be at least  ten (10)
Business  Days  after the date such  notice is sent to the  Holders).  KCS shall
include in such  registration  all  Registrable  Stock with respect to which KCS
receives  written  requests  from the  Holders  thereof  for  inclusion  therein
(stating the intended  method of disposition of such  Registrable  Stock) within
the ten (10)  Business  Days prior to the filing of the  Registration  Statement
relating to such request.  KCS will use commercially  reasonable efforts to file
the Registration  Statement relating to the Request to permit the disposition of
all  Registrable  Stock as to which KCS has  received  notices  from  Holders in
accordance  with the intended  methods of disposition  set forth in such notices
not later than thirty  (30)  Business  Days after  receipt by KCS of the initial
Request;  provided  that  KCS  shall  not be  required  to  file a  Registration
Statement  prior to the 180th day after the  consummation of the Acquisition (it
being understood that if a Request is made prior to such time the filing of such
Registration Statement shall be deferred until such 180th day). Thereafter,  KCS
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared  effective  at  the  earliest   practicable  time  and  shall  use  its
commercially  reasonable efforts to keep such Registration  Statement  effective
for the period of time  required to effect the  disposition  by such  Holders in
accordance with the intended method of disposition  described in the requests of
such  Holders,  all to the  extent  requisite  to  permit  such  sale  or  other
disposition by such Holders of the Registrable  Stock so registered.  So long as
KCS is eligible  to use Form S-3 (or any  successor  form) under the  Securities
Act,  any  Request  may  specify  that the  Registration  Statement  be a "shelf
registration" permitting the offering of Registrable Stock registered thereby on
a delayed or continuous  basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or
any successor

<PAGE>

rule),  in which  case,  KCS shall use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
maintain such Registration Statement continuously effective and usable for sales
thereunder  for a period of not more than one year;  provided that KCS shall not
be required hereunder to file more than one "shelf registration".

     (B) The foregoing registration rights of Holders of Registrable Stock shall
be deemed satisfied by KCS when six Registration  Statements  covering shares of
Registrable  Stock which KCS has been requested to register  pursuant to Section
2(A)  hereof  shall  have  been  filed by KCS with  and  made  effective  by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission  under the Securities  Act. To the extent an
underwritten   public  offering  is  the  intended  method  of  distribution  of
Registrable   Stock  with  respect  to  any  Request   submitted,   the  Holders
participating  in such  offering  shall have the right to select the  investment
banker or bankers  who shall  serve as the manager  and/or  co-managers  for the
offering of Securities  covered by such Registration  Statement,  subject to the
approval by KCS of such  selection,  which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld.

     (C) Any  registration  under  this  Section 2 shall be on such  appropriate
registration  form of the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (i) as shall be
selected  by KCS and (ii) as shall  permit the  disposition  of the  Registrable
Stock in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition specified
in Holders' requests for such registration.

     (D)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  KCS shall be  permitted to delay the
filing of any Registration  Statement  pursuant to this Section 2: (i) if KCS is
not eligible to use Form S-3 (or a comparable or successor  form) to effect such
registration;  (ii) if KCS,  within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Request,
gives notice to the Holders of its bona fide intention to effect the filing of a
Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the Request (other than a Registration Statement on Form
S-8), in which case KCS's obligation to file the Registration Statement pursuant
to this Section 2 shall be deferred for a period not to exceed  ninety (90) days
from the  date of the  Request;  or (iii) if KCS  shall  furnish  to  Holders  a
resolution  adopted by the Board of  Directors  of KCS to the effect that in the
good  faith  judgment  of KCS it would  be  seriously  detrimental  to KCS for a
Registration  Statement to be filed at that time,  specifying with particularity
the  basis  therefor   (subject  to  the  Holders   entering  into   appropriate
non-disclosure agreements) in which case KCS's obligation to file a Registration
Statement  shall be deferred for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the
receipt of the  Request.  KCS shall not be required  to effect any  registration
pursuant  to this  Section  2 once it has  effected  six  (6)  registrations  in
accordance with Section 2.

     (E) In determining the number of  registrations  effected  pursuant to this
Section 2, such  registrations  shall not  include any  registration  if (i) the
Registration  Statement did not become effective or remain in effect as required
by this  Section  2; or (ii) the  Registration  Statement  is  withdrawn  at the
request of the Holders and the Holders  agree to pay the  Registration  Expenses
associated with such Registration Statement.

     (F) KCS shall not permit any  securities of any other person to be included
in any  Registration  Statement  filed  pursuant  to this  Section 2, other than
securities sold for the account of KCS, without the consent of the Holders whose
Registrable  Stock is included in such  Registration  Statement,  which  consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

<PAGE>

     (G) KCS  shall use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  qualify  for
eligibility to use Form S-3 with respect to registrations  requested pursuant to
this Section 2.

     3. INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION.

     (A) If  KCS,  at any  time  after  the  180  days  following  the  date  of
consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Acquisition  Agreement,
proposes or is required to file a  registration  statement  under the Securities
Act  related  to the offer or sale of shares  of  Common  Stock on a form  which
permits  inclusion of the  Registrable  Stock (other than a registration on Form
S-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar  forms),  it will give written  notice to
all Holders of then existing  Registrable  Stock of its intention so to do. Upon
the written request of any such Holder given to KCS within fifteen Business Days
after receipt of any such notice,  KCS will,  subject to the  provisions of this
Registration Rights Agreement,  use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
such Registrable  Stock which such Holders shall have requested be registered to
be registered  under the  Securities  Act, to the extent  required to permit the
disposition   by  such  Holders  of  the   Registrable   Stock  so   registered.
Registrations  of Registrable  Stock under this Section 3 shall not constitute a
registration  effected  pursuant  to Section  2. To the  extent an  underwritten
public  offering is the intended  method of  distribution  of Registrable  Stock
included in a registration pursuant to this Section 3, KCS shall have the right,
in its sole  discretion,  to select the  investment  banker or bankers who shall
serve as the manager and/or  co-managers for all  registrations  of offerings of
Registrable Stock under this Section 3.

     (B)  Except as  provided  in  Sections  2 and 3 hereof,  KCS shall  have no
obligation to register any  Securities  held by any Holder under the  Securities
Act or under any foreign, state or other securities laws.

     4. REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES.  Whenever KCS is required by the provisions of
this Registration Rights Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the  registration of any Registrable  Stock under the Securities Act, KCS
will:

     (A)  Prepare  and file  (within  the period  required  by Section 2 for all
registrations  pursuant  to such  Section)  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission a Registration  Statement with respect to such Registrable  Stock and
use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause such  Registration  Statement to
become and remain  continuously  effective for a period  necessary to effect the
sale of the  Registrable  Stock  in  accordance  with  the  intended  method  of
disposition and the requirements of this Registration Rights Agreement, provided
that before filing a  Registration  Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
supplements  thereto, KCS will furnish to counsel for the Holders of Registrable
Stock  included  in such  Registration  Statement  copies of all such  documents
proposed to be filed, which documents (other than the documents  incorporated by
reference therein) will be subject to the review of such counsel.

     KCS's obligations under this Section 4 shall be subject to the following:

          (i)  If,  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement
     relating  to  Registrable  Stock,  KCS  shall  furnish  to  the  Holders  a
     resolution of its Board of Directors stating that KCS has determined in its
     good faith  judgment  that the sale of  Registrable  Stock by such  Holders
     pursuant to the Registration Statement would require disclosure of material
     non-public information,  the current disclosure of which would, in the sole
     judgment of the Board of

<PAGE>

     Directors  of  KCS,  be  materially  detrimental  to KCS  (an  "Information
     Blackout"), then KCS's obligation to file the Registration Statement and to
     use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Registration Statement
     declared effective shall be deferred for a period not to exceed the earlier
     of (x) the date upon which such  material  information  is disclosed to the
     public or (y) sixty  (60) days  after the Board of  Directors  of KCS makes
     such good faith determination (such period being the "Information  Blackout
     Period").

          (ii)  If  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement
     relating  to  Registrable  Stock,  KCS  shall  furnish  to  the  Holders  a
     certificate  stating that the Board of Directors of KCS has  determined  in
     its good faith judgment that KCS is required to file  financial  statements
     with the Securities and Exchange  Commission in connection  with a material
     acquisition or other event (a "Financial Statement  Blackout"),  then KCS's
     obligation to file the  Registration  Statement and to use its commercially
     reasonable  efforts to have such Registration  Statement declared effective
     shall be  deferred  for a period not to exceed the  earlier of (x) the date
     upon which such  financial  statements  are filed with the  Securities  and
     Exchange   Commission  (it  being   understood   that  KCS  shall  use  its
     commercially  reasonable efforts to file such financial  statements as soon
     as  practicable,  or (y) sixty  (60) days  after KCS makes  such good faith
     determination   (such  period  being  the  "Financial   Statement  Blackout
     Period").  Any such determination  shall be accompanied by a certificate or
     letter from KCS's  independent  auditors  to the effect that such  auditors
     agree  that such  financial  statements  are  required  to be  included  or
     incorporated  by  reference in such  Registration  Statement to permit such
     Registration  Statement to become  effective under the Securities Act or to
     permit continued sales thereunder, as the case may be.

          (iii) If a Registration  Statement  relating to  Registrable  Stock is
     effective,  upon  written  notice of an  Information  Blackout or Financial
     Statement  Blackout from KCS to the Holders,  KCS may request suspension of
     and the  Holders  shall  suspend  sales of  Registrable  Stock  by  Holders
     pursuant to such Registration Statement for the Information Blackout Period
     or the Financial Statement Blackout Period.

          (iv) KCS shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to ensure that the
     aggregate  number of days in any  period of  twelve  consecutive  months in
     which an Information Blackout or Financial Statement Blackout or a deferral
     pursuant to Section 2(D) is in effect shall not be more than ninety (90).

     (B) Prepare  and file with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  such
amendments  and  supplements to such  Registration  Statement and the Prospectus
used in  connection  therewith  as may be  necessary  to keep such  Registration
Statement effective for a period necessary to effect the sale of the Registrable
Stock  thereunder,  which  shall in no  event  exceed  120  days (or the  period
specified in Section 2 in the case of a shelf  registration)  and to comply with
the  provisions of the  Securities  Act with respect to the  disposition  of all
Registrable Stock covered by such  Registration  Statement during such period in
accordance  with the intended  method or methods of  disposition  by the Sellers
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement;

     (C)  Furnish  to each  Seller  such  number of copies of such  Registration
Statement and the exhibits thereto,  each amendment and supplement thereto,  the
Prospectus  included in the Registration  Statement  (including each preliminary
Prospectus),   all  documents   incorporated   by  reference  or  deemed  to  be
incorporated by reference in the Registration  Statement or the

<PAGE>

Prospectus,  and such other documents,  as such Seller may reasonably request in
order to  facilitate  the  disposition  of the  Registrable  Stock owned by such
Seller  covered by the  Registration  Statement in accordance  with the intended
method of disposition;

     (D)  Use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  register  or  qualify  the
Registrable  Stock  covered  by such  Registration  Statement  under  such other
securities  or blue sky  laws of such  jurisdictions  in the  United  States  of
America as each Seller shall reasonably  request,  to keep such registrations or
qualifications in effect for so long as such  Registration  Statement remains in
effect,  and do any and all other acts and things which may be  necessary  under
such  securities  or blue sky laws to  enable  such  Seller  to  consummate  the
disposition in such  jurisdictions of the Registrable Stock owned by such Seller
covered by such Registration Statement (provided,  however, that KCS will not be
required to (i) in the case of a registration pursuant to Section 3, register or
qualify such Seller's  Registrable Stock in any jurisdiction  where shares to be
sold by KCS or any  other  Person  initiating  such  registration  are not to be
registered  or  qualified,  (ii)  qualify  generally to do business as a foreign
corporation  in any  jurisdiction  where it would not  otherwise  be required to
qualify  but for this  subparagraph,  (iii)  subject  itself to  taxation in any
jurisdiction or (iv) consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction);

     (E) Notify  each  Seller,  at any time when a  Prospectus  relating  to the
Registrable  Stock of such  Seller  covered by such  Registration  Statement  is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event
as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration  Statement, as
then in effect,  contains  an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading
in light of the  circumstances  then  existing,  and at the  request of any such
Seller,  promptly  prepare a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that,
as thereafter  delivered to the purchasers of the  Registrable  Stock covered by
such  Registration  Statement,  such  Prospectus  will  not  contain  an  untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact  necessary to
make the statements  therein not misleading in light of the  circumstances  then
existing;

     (F) Cause all Registrable Stock covered by such  Registration  Statement to
be listed on the principal  securities  exchange on which Securities of the same
class are then listed;

     (G)  Make  available  for  inspection  by  any  Seller,   any   underwriter
participating in any disposition  pursuant to such Registration  Statement,  and
any attorney,  accountant or other agent retained by Sellers  holding at least a
majority of the Registrable Stock included in such registration  pursuant to the
provisions  of this  Registration  Rights  Agreement  such  financial  and other
records,  pertinent  corporate  documents  and  properties  of  KCS  as  may  be
reasonably  requested  by  such  party  in  connection  with  such  Registration
Statement  solely  for the  purpose  of  effecting  sales of  Registrable  Stock
included in such registration; and

     (H) In connection  with any  underwritten  offering  pursuant to Section 2,
Sellers shall (i) enter into an  underwriting  agreement in customary  form with
the  underwriters  participating  in the offering;  and (ii) provide  reasonable
cooperation  to the  underwriters  and the Holders in marketing the  Registrable
Stock; provided, that not more than one KCS officer (the chief financial officer
or other  appropriate  officer)  shall be required to  participate  in any "road
show" or similar  presentation  in  connection  with such  offering and any such
participation shall be subject to such officer's  availability,  shall be at the
Holders'  expense and shall be limited to offerings  with an aggregate  offering
price of at least $100 million.

<PAGE>

     In connection with any  registration  hereunder,  each Seller shall furnish
KCS such  information  regarding  such  Seller,  the  Registrable  Stock and the
intended plan of  distribution  thereof as KCS may from time to time  reasonably
request in writing and, if any Seller does not furnish such information prior to
the filing of the Registration Statement,  KCS may exclude the Registrable Stock
of such Holder from such Registration Statement.

     Each  Seller  shall  be  deemed  to  have  agreed  by  acquisition  of  the
Registrable Stock that, upon receipt of any notice from KCS of the occurrence of
any event of the kind described in Subsection (E) of this Section 4, such Seller
will forthwith  discontinue its disposition of the Registrable Stock pursuant to
the Registration Statement relating thereto until Seller's receipt of the copies
of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Subsection (E) of this
Section 4 and, if so directed by KCS, will deliver to KCS (at KCS's expense) all
copies,  other than  permanent file copies,  then in Seller's  possession of the
Prospectus  relating to the Registrable  Stock current at the time of receipt of
such notice.

     5. EXPENSES. With respect to the first four registrations effected pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2 and registrations which include Registrable Stock
pursuant to Section 3, KCS shall pay all Registration Expenses.  With respect to
any  registrations  effected  pursuant  to  Section  2  beyond  the  first  four
registrations, the Holders whose shares of Registrable Stock are included in the
applicable registration shall pay all Registration Expenses.

     6. INDEMNIFICATION.

     (A) In the event of a  registration  of any  Registrable  Stock pursuant to
this Registration  Rights Agreement,  KCS shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller,  each  underwriter (in the case of any  underwritten  offering) and each
person,  if any, who controls such Seller or  underwriter  within the meaning of
the Securities Act, and each officer, director,  employee and advisor of each of
the  foregoing  (each a "Seller  Indemnitee"),  against  any  expenses,  losses,
claims,  damages  or  liabilities,  joint  or  several,  to  which  such  Seller
Indemnitee may become subject under the Securities Act, any state securities law
or  otherwise,  including  any of the  foregoing  incurred in  settlement of any
litigation,  commenced or threatened,  insofar as such expenses, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon (i) any untrue  statement or alleged untrue  statement of any material fact
contained in any  Registration  Statement under which such shares are registered
under  the  Securities  Act,  any  preliminary  Prospectus  or final  Prospectus
contained therein, any summary Prospectus used in connection with any securities
being registered,  or any amendment or supplement  thereto; or (ii) any omission
or alleged  omission  to state  therein a material  fact  required  to be stated
therein  or  necessary  to  make  the  statements   therein,  in  light  of  the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) any violation
by KCS of the Securities Act or rules of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
thereunder or any blue sky laws or any rules promulgated  thereunder,  and shall
reimburse  each such  Seller  Indemnitee  for any  legal or any  other  expenses
reasonably  incurred by them in connection with  investigating  or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that KCS shall
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim,
damage  or  liability  arises  out of or is based  upon an untrue  statement  or
alleged  untrue   statement  or  omission  or  alleged  omission  made  in  such
Registration  Statement,  said  preliminary  Prospectus  or said  Prospectus  or
summary  Prospectus  or said  amendment or  supplement  in reliance  upon and in
conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to KCS by or on behalf of the
Seller or any underwriter  specifically for use in the

preparation  thereof;  and  PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  that if any  expenses,  losses,
claims,  damages  or  liabilities  arise  out of or are  based  upon  an  untrue
statement,  alleged untrue statement,  omission or alleged omission contained in
any preliminary  Prospectus  which did not appear in the final  Prospectus,  KCS
shall not have any liability  with respect  thereto to any Seller  Indemnitee if
any Seller  Indemnitee  delivered a copy of the  preliminary  Prospectus  to the
person alleging such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and failed
to deliver a copy of the final  Prospectus as amended or  supplemented if it has
been  amended  or  supplemented,  to such  person  at or  prior  to the  written
confirmation of the sale to such person.

     (B) In the event of a  registration  of any  Registrable  Stock pursuant to
this Registration  Rights Agreement,  each Holder shall,  jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless KCS and each person, if any, who controls KCS within
the  meaning  of  the  Securities  Act,  each  officer  of  KCS  who  signs  the
Registration  Statement,  each  director  of KCS and each  underwriter  and each
person who controls any  underwriter  within the meaning of the  Securities  Act
(each a  "Company  Indemnitee"),  against  any and all  such  expenses,  losses,
claims,  damages or  liabilities  referred to in Section 6(A) if the  statement,
alleged  statement,  omission  or  alleged  omission  in  respect  of which such
expense,  loss, claim, damage or liability is asserted was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with  information  furnished in writing to KCS by or on behalf
of a Holder of Registrable  Stock  specifically  for use in connection  with the
preparation of such registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus,  Prospectus,
summary Prospectus, amendment or supplement.

     (C)  Promptly  after  receipt  by an  indemnified  party of  notice  of the
commencement of any action,  such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the  indemnifying  party,  notify the indemnifying
party in writing of the commencement  thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying  party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified  party otherwise than under this Article 6 or to the extent that
it has not been  prejudiced as a proximate  result of such failure.  In case any
such action shall be brought against any indemnified  party, and it shall notify
the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall
be entitled to  participate  therein  and, to the extent that it shall wish,  to
assume  the  defense  thereof,  with  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to such
indemnified party; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if the defendants in any such action
include  both  the  indemnified  party  and  the  indemnifying   party  and  the
indemnified  party  shall  have  reasonably  concluded  that  there may be legal
defenses  available to it and/or other  indemnified  parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties  shall have the right to select one separate  counsel to assert
such legal  defenses  (in which case the  indemnifying  party shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or
parties). Upon the permitted assumption by the indemnifying party of the defense
of such action,  the indemnifying  party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under this Article 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by such  indemnified  party in connection  with the defense  thereof (other than
reasonable costs of  investigation)  unless (i) the indemnified party shall have
employed one separate  counsel  (together  with any local counsel) in connection
with the  assertion  of legal  defenses  in  accordance  with the proviso to the
preceding sentence,  (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel
reasonably  satisfactory to the  indemnified  party to represent the indemnified
party within a reasonable time, (iii) the indemnifying  party and its counsel do
not  actively  and  vigorously  pursue the  defense  of such  action or (iv) the
indemnifying  party has  authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the
indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party.

     7. PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN  REGISTRATIONS.  No Holder may participate
in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell
such  Holder's  Registrable  Stock on the  basis  provided  in any  underwriting
arrangements  approved  by  the  persons  entitled  hereunder  to  approve  such
arrangements  and (ii)  completes  and  executes all  questionnaires,  powers of
attorney,  indemnities,  underwriting  agreements and other  documents  required
under the terms of such underwriting  arrangements;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that no
Holder of  Registrable  Stock shall be required to make any  representations  or
warranties or to provide  information in the Registration  Statement relating to
such  registration  except,  in either  case,  with  respect  to itself  and its
intended method of disposition of Registrable Stock.

     8. UNDERWRITING CUT-BACKS.

     (A) If

          (1) any Holder of Registrable Stock is entitled and wishes to register
     any Registrable  Stock in a registration made pursuant to Section 2 hereof,
     and

          (2) the offering proposed to be made by the Holder or Holders for whom
     such  registration is to be made is to be an underwritten  public offering,
     and

          (3) KCS wishes to register Securities in such registration, and

          (4) the  managing  underwriters  of such  public  offering  furnish  a
     written  opinion that the total amount of Securities to be included in such
     offering  would exceed the maximum  amount of  Securities  (as specified in
     such opinion)  which can be marketed at a price  reasonably  related to the
     then  current  market  value  of  such  Securities  and  without  otherwise
     materially and adversely affecting such offering,

then the  relative  rights to  participate  in such  offering  of the Holders of
Registrable  Stock, the holders of other Securities  having the right to include
such Securities in such registration, and KCS shall be in the following order of
priority:

          First:  The  Holders  of  Registrable   Stock  shall  be  entitled  to
     participate in accordance  with the number of shares of  Registrable  Stock
     which each such Holder shall request to be registered,  such  participation
     to be pro rata in  accordance  with the  number of shares  which  each such
     Holder  shall  request  be  registered  if,  pursuant  to  clause 4 of this
     Subsection  (A),  the total  amount of  Securities  to be  included  in the
     offering will be less than the number of shares of  Registrable  Stock that
     all of such Holders shall request be registered; and then

          Second: KCS shall be entitled to participate; and then

          Third:  All  holders of other  Securities  having the right to include
     such  Securities in such  registration  shall be entitled to participate in
     accordance with the relative priorities, if any, as shall exist among them.

     (B) If

          (1)  any  Holder  of  Registrable  Stock  entitled  to do so  requests
     registration of Registrable Stock under Section 3 hereof, and

<PAGE>

          (2) the offering  proposed to be made is to be an underwritten  public
     offering, and

          (3) the  managing  underwriters  of such  public  offering  furnish  a
     written  opinion that the total amount of Securities to be included in such
     offering  would exceed the maximum  amount of  Securities  (as specified in
     such opinion)  which can be marketed at a price  reasonably  related to the
     then current  market value of such  Securities  and without  materially and
     adversely affecting such offering,

then the  relative  rights to  participate  in such  offering  of the Holders of
Registrable  Stock, the holders of other Securities  having the right to include
such Securities in such registration, and KCS shall be in the following order of
priority:

          First: KCS or the persons  requesting such registration (if other than
     KCS) shall be entitled  to  participate  in  accordance  with the  relative
     priorities, if any, as shall exist among them; and then

          Second:  All other holders of  Securities  having the right to include
     such  Securities  in  such  registration  (including  the  Holders  of  the
     Registrable  Stock) shall be entitled to participate pro rata in accordance
     with the number of shares  requested by such holders to be included in such
     registration.

     9. MARKET  STANDOFF.  Each Holder  hereby  agrees that,  during the 10 days
prior to, and during the period of duration (up to, but not exceeding,  90 days)
specified  by KCS and an  underwriter  of  Common  Stock  or  Securities  of KCS
convertible  into Common Stock,  following the effective  date of a Registration
Statement  (or, to the extent  applicable,  a Prospectus  filed pursuant to Rule
424(b)) covering Common Stock or Securities of KCS convertible into Common Stock
that are being  offered  solely for the account of KCS, the Holder shall not, to
the extent requested by KCS and such  underwriter,  directly or indirectly sell,
offer to sell,  contract to sell  (including,  short  sale),  enter into any put
equivalent position (as defined by Rule 16a-1),  grant any option to purchase or
otherwise transfer or dispose of (other than to donees who agree to be similarly
bound) any Registrable  Stock, or in any economic interest therein,  held by the
Holder at any time during such period except  Registrable  Stock covered by such
Registration  Statement;  provided,  that (i) no Holder shall be subject to such
restriction  to the extent that KCS or any of its officers or directors  are not
subject  to any  such  restriction  and  (ii) if  KCS,  any of its  officers  or
directors or any other person  subject to any such  restriction is released from
any such restriction  then such restriction  shall expire with respect to all of
the  Registrable  Stock held by the Holders.  In order to enforce the  foregoing
covenant,  KCS  may  impose  stop-transfer  instructions  with  respect  to  the
Registrable  Stock of each Holder until the end of such period,  and each Holder
agrees that, if so requested,  such Holder will execute an agreement in the form
provided by the underwriter  containing  terms which are essentially  consistent
with the provisions of this Section 9.

     10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  Each Holder of Registrable Stock agrees that
any information  obtained pursuant to this  Registration  Rights Agreement which
is, or would  reasonably  be  perceived to be,  proprietary  to KCS or otherwise
confidential  will not be disclosed  without the prior  written  consent of KCS,
unless required to be included,  and until such inclusion,  in any  Registration
Statement  being  filed  pursuant  to  this   Registration   Rights

<PAGE>

Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  each Holder of Registrable Stock may
disclose  such  information,  on a need  to  know  basis,  to  their  employees,
accountants  or  attorneys  (so long as each such  person  to whom  confidential
information is disclosed  agrees to keep such  information  confidential)  or in
compliance  with a  court  order.  Each  Holder  of  Registrable  Stock  further
acknowledges,  understands and agrees that any confidential information will not
be utilized (a) in connection  with purchases  and/or sales of KCS's  Securities
except in compliance with applicable state and federal antifraud statutes or (b)
for any other purpose.

     11.  NOTICE  OF  PROPOSED   TRANSFERS.   The  Holder  of  each  certificate
representing  Registrable  Stock by acceptance  thereof  agrees to comply in all
respects with the provisions of this Section 11. Each certificate evidencing the
Registrable  Stock  transferred  as above  provided  shall bear the  appropriate
restrictive  legend set forth in  Section  9.9 of the  Stockholders'  Agreement,
except that such certificate  shall not bear such  restrictive  legend if in the
opinion  of  counsel  for such  Holder and  counsel  for KCS such  legend is not
required in order to establish  compliance  with any provision of the Securities
Act.

     12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  This Registration Rights Agreement shall inure
to the  benefit  of and be binding  upon the  successors  of any of the  parties
hereto; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, the rights and benefits of TMM, MM and the Principal
Stockholders  with respect to their ability to cause the Registrable Stock to be
covered by a Registration  Statement  pursuant to Section 2 and Section 3 hereof
may be assigned only to  transferees  who are Permitted  Transferees;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER that such  assignee  shall be entitled to such rights and benefits  only
upon becoming party to this Registration  Rights Agreement as to any Registrable
Stock held by such Permitted Transferee,  with all the rights and obligations of
its assignor under this Registration Rights Agreement, by delivering an executed
joinder to the other  parties to this  Registration  Rights  Agreement in a form
satisfactory to the parties thereto.

     13.  SEVERABILITY.  Whenever possible,  each provision of this Registration
Rights Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Registration Rights Agreement
is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will
be ineffective  only to the extent of such  prohibition  or invalidity,  without
invalidating the remainder of this Registration Rights Agreement.

     14.  DESCRIPTIVE  HEADINGS.  The descriptive  headings of this Registration
Rights  Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part
of this Registration Rights Agreement.

     15. NOTICES. All communications  provided for hereunder shall be in writing

service to the following addresses, or such other addresses as shall be given by

     17. TERMINATION.  All rights under this Registration Rights Agreement shall
terminate  as to any  Holder on the  earliest  to occur of (i) the date which is

pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or a comparable  exemption from
registration  that  enables the Holder to sell all shares of  Registrable  Stock
held by such Holder  without  registration  under the Securities Act and without
restriction  as to the  manner  of  sale.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the
provisions of Section 6 hereof and the rights and obligations  thereunder  shall
survive the termination of this Registration Rights Agreement.

     18. COUNTERPARTS. This Registration Rights Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same document.

<PAGE>

     19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Registration  Rights Agreement  constitutes the
entire  agreement  by and among the parties  hereto with  respect to the subject
matter hereof.  There are no promises,  warranties or  undertakings,  other than
those set forth herein,  with respect to the registration  rights granted by KCS
with  respect to the  Registrable  Stock.  This  Registration  Rights  Agreement
supersedes  all prior  agreements  and  understandings  between the parties with
respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof;  provided  that,  in the  event of any
conflict  between  this  Registration  Rights  Agreement  and the  Stockholders'
Agreement or the Acquisition Agreement, the provisions of those other agreements
shall control.

     20.  AMENDMENTS,  GOVERNING LAW,  JURISDICTION AND VENUE. This Registration
Rights  Agreement  may be amended,  modified or  supplemented  only by a written
instrument  executed  by KCS and Holders of not less than a majority of the then
existing shares of Registrable Stock. Any term, covenant, agreement or condition
in this  Registration  Rights  Agreement may be waived  (either  generally or in
particular  instances  and either  retroactively  or  prospectively)  by written
instruments  signed  by KCS and  Holders  of not  less  than a  majority  of the
existing  shares of Registrable  Stock.  Any such waiver shall be limited to its
express  terms and shall  not be  termed a waiver of any other  term,  covenant,
agreement or condition.  This Registration Rights Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts  made and to be performed in that state  without  giving any effect to
any  choice  or  conflict  of law  provision  or rule  (whether  in the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
of any jurisdiction  other than the State of Delaware.  Each party hereto hereby
agrees that any proceeding  relating to this Registration Rights Agreement shall
be brought in a state court of New York or a federal  court located in New York.
Each party hereto hereby  consents to personal  jurisdiction  in any such action
brought  in any such New York  state or federal  court,  consents  to service of
process  by  registered  mail made upon such  party and such  party's  agent and
waives any  objection  to venue in any such New York state or federal  court and
any  claim  that any such New York  state or  federal  court is an  inconvenient
forum.

     21. SERVICE OF PROCESS.  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably appoints CT
Corporation  (the "Process  Agent"),  at 111 Eighth  Avenue,  New York, New York
10011  (212-894-8940) as its agent and true and lawful  attorney-in-fact  in its
name,  place and stead to  accept  on  behalf of each of the  parties  and their
respective  properties  and  revenues,  service  of  copies of the  summons  and
complaint  and any other  process  which  may be  served  in any such  action or
proceeding  brought  in the State of New York,  and each of the  parties  hereto
agrees that failure of the Process  Agent to give any notice of any such service
of process to any of the parties  hereto shall not impair or affect the validity
of such service or the enforcement of any judgment based thereon.

<PAGE>

     IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,   each  of  the  parties  hereto  has  executed  this
Registration Rights Agreement as of the day and year first written above.
