ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

     On December  15, 2004,  Kansas City  Southern  ("KCS") and Grupo TMM,  S.A.
("TMM") announced that they had entered into an Amended and Restated Acquisition
Agreement (the "Amended Acquisition  Agreement") on that date for KCS to acquire
control of TFM, S.A. de C.V.  ("TFM").  A copy of the press release  making this
announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

     Since 1997,  pursuant to a joint  venture  agreement  (which  terminated on
December  1,  2003),  and  other  agreements,  entered  into  by  KCS  and  TMM,
subsidiaries  of KCS  and  TMM  have  owned,  along  with  Mexican  governmental
agencies,  interests in Grupo Transportacion  Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.
("Grupo  TFM").  Grupo TFM is the owner of 80% of the stock of TFM,  and 100% of
its full voting  stock.  TFM holds the  concession to operate,  and operates,  a
major rail system located in the north and central portions of Mexico.  In 1995,
KCS acquired from TMM 49% of the stock of Mexrail,  Inc.  ("Mexrail"),  owner of
100% of the  voting  stock of The  Texas-Mexican  Railway  Company  ("Tex-Mex").
Tex-Mex operates a 157 mile rail line from Laredo to Corpus Christi,  Texas, and
connects the  operations of The Kansas City Southern  Railway  Company  ("KCSR")
with TFM.  Tex-Mex  connects  with TFM at Laredo and  connects  to KCSR  through
trackage rights at Beaumont,  Texas.  Mexrail also owns the northern half of the
international  railway bridge at Laredo, Texas. TFM, through its concession with
the Mexican  government,  has the right to control and operate the southern half
of the rail-bridge at Laredo.  In March,  2002, KCS and TMM sold their interests
in Mexrail to TFM,  with KCS receiving  approximately  $31.4 million for its 49%
interest in Mexrail.

     On August 16, 2004,  KCS  reacquired  from TFM 51% of the shares of Mexrail
for  approximately  $32.7 million and deposited the Mexrail shares into a voting
trust pending  resolution  of KCS's  application  to the Surface  Transportation
Board  ("STB")  seeking  authority to exercise  common  control over Tex-Mex and
KCS's other rail companies,  KCSR and the Gateway Eastern Railway  Company.  The
STB approved KCS's application on November 29, 2004 and the decision will become
effective  on  December  29,  2004.  KCS intends to  dissolve  the voting  trust
following  effectiveness  of the STB  decision  and the  Mexrail  shares will be
released  by the voting  trust to KCS on January 1, 2005.  KCS has an  exclusive
option to purchase  from TFM on or before  October 31, 2005 the remaining 49% of
the shares of Mexrail. If KCS does not fully exercise this option by October 31,
2005, KCS is obligated to purchase any remaining shares on October 31, 2005. The
purchase  price for the  remaining  49% of the Mexrail  shares is  approximately
$31.4 million.

AMENDED ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

     The Amended  Acquisition  Agreement,  dated  December 15, 2004,  amends and
restates  the  acquisition  agreement  entered  into by KCS and TMM on April 20,
2003.  The  parties  to the  Amended  Acquisition  Agreement  are  KCS  and  its
subsidiaries,  KARA Sub,  Inc.  ("KARA  Sub"),  KCS  Investment  I,  Ltd.  ("KCS
Investment"),   KCS  Acquisition   Subsidiary,   Inc.  ("KCS  Sub")  and  Caymex
Transportation, Inc. ("Caymex"), TMM and its subsidiaries, TMM Holdings, S.A. de
C.V. ("TMMH"), TMM Multimodal, S.A. de C.V. ("MM"), and Grupo TFM.

     Pursuant  to the  Amended  Acquisition  Agreement  for the  acquisition  of
control of Grupo TFM, TFM and their subsidiaries (the  "Acquisition"),  KCS will
acquire all of the interest of TMM (held by its subsidiary, MM) in Grupo TFM for
the  following  consideration:  (i)  at the  closing  of  the  Acquisition  (the
"Closing"), $200 million in cash and 18,000,000 shares of KCS Common Stock; (ii)
upon  resolution  of  certain  proceedings  related  to TFM's  VAT claim and the
Mexican  government's Put (defined  below),  payments up to $110 million in cash
and KCS Common Stock (the "VAT Contingency Payment");  and (iii) at the Closing,
KCS  promissory  notes in the  aggregate  principal  amount of $47 million  (the
"Indemnity  Escrow  Notes")  which will be deposited  in an escrow  account (the
"Indemnity  Escrow") and held, reduced and released in accordance with the terms
of an indemnity escrow agreement (the "Indemnity  Escrow  Agreement").  At KCS's
option,  KCS may convert the remaining  balance due under the  Indemnity  Escrow
Notes into  shares of KCS Common  Stock on the terms set forth in the  Indemnity
Escrow Notes. A copy of the form of Indemnity  Escrow Note is attached hereto as
Exhibit 10.2. The cash,  notes and securities have

<PAGE>

been  placed  into  escrow to be  delivered  in  accordance  with the terms of a
closing escrow agreement (the "Closing Escrow Agreement").

     The obligations of KCS and TMM to complete the Acquisition are subject to a
number of conditions,  including  approval by KCS's stockholders of the issuance
of KCS  Common  Stock in  connection  with the  Acquisition.  TMM's  controlling
shareholders  have entered into and amended voting trusts  pursuant to which the
trustees  have been  irrevocably  instructed to vote such shares in favor of the
Amended Acquisition Agreement and related transactions.  The Amended Acquisition
Agreement  is  subject  to  termination  prior  to  the  Closing  under  certain
circumstances.  A  termination  fee of $18  million  is  payable in the event of
termination of the Amended Acquisition Agreement under certain circumstances.

     The Amended Acquisition Agreement also contains indemnification  provisions
pursuant to which the  Parties  will  indemnify  each other and certain of their
affiliates  against  certain losses and tax  liabilities.  KCS and TMM have also
agreed that upon Closing of the Acquisition all litigation  between them will be
dismissed.

     Upon completion of the Acquisition,  KCS will acquire TMM's right, and will
assume TMM's obligations to make any required payment,  upon the exercise by the
Mexican  government  of its right to compel the  purchase of its 20% interest in
TFM (the "Put") and will indemnify TMM and its affiliates,  and their respective
officers,  directors,   employees  and  shareholders,   against  obligations  or
liabilities relating thereto.

     KCS and  Harris  Trust & Savings  Bank,  as  Rights  Agent  will  amend the
Stockholder  Rights Agreement dated September 19, 1995 (the "Rights  Agreement")
to, among other things,  amend the definition of "Acquiring  Person" so that the
Acquisition will not trigger the rights under the Rights Agreement.

     The description of the Amended Acquisition Agreement and related documents,
contained  herein, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the
documents attached hereto as exhibits.

     In connection with the Acquisition,  except as otherwise indicated, KCS has
entered into, effective as of the Closing, the following additional agreements:

STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT

     This  agreement,   with  TMM,  certain  subsidiaries  of  TMM  and  certain
stockholders  of  TMM  (the  "Principal   Stockholders")   contains   standstill
provisions,   restrictions  on  transfer   provisions  and  pre-emptive   rights
provisions with respect to TMM, such subsidiaries,  the Principal  Stockholders,
and  their  respective  affiliates  who are then  holders  of KCS  Common  Stock
(collectively,  the "TMM  Holders").  Under the standstill  provisions,  the TMM
Holders agree not to (i) acquire (other than in connection  with the Acquisition
or  pursuant  to  the  Stockholders'  Agreement  or  the  Consulting  Agreement)
aggregate beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the Total Voting Power of KCS
(as  defined  in the  Stockholders'  Agreement),  (ii)  propose  any  matter for
submission to a vote of stockholders of KCS or participate in making, or solicit
stockholders  for the  approval  of, any  stockholder  proposal,  grant  certain
proxies with respect to any voting  securities  of KCS, or (iii) seek to control
or influence  materially the management,  Board of Directors or policies of KCS.
The transfer  restrictions prohibit the TMM Holders from certain dispositions of
voting  securities of KCS which they hold (i) to a competitor of KCS, (ii) to an
affiliate  unless  the  affiliate  agrees to be bound by the  provisions  of the
Stockholders'  Agreement,  (iii) that in the aggregate  represents 5% or more of
the  outstanding  voting  securities of KCS, or (iv) to any person or group that
would,  after giving effect to such  acquisition,  beneficially  own or have the
right to acquire  more than 15% of the Total  Voting  Power of KCS. In addition,
the TMM Holders may not dispose of any capital stock or voting securities of KCS
or control of any person that,  directly or  indirectly,  beneficially  owns any
voting  securities of KCS to a competitor of KCS, except as otherwise  permitted
by the Stockholders'  Agreement.  The standstill provisions and the restrictions
on transfer provisions apply for a period of seven years from the effective date
of  the  Stockholders'  Agreement,   subject  to  earlier  termination  of  such
provisions  under certain  circumstances.  The TMM Holders'  pre-emptive  rights
under the Stockholders'  Agreement  terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the
date that the TMM Holders beneficially own in

<PAGE>

the aggregate less than 40% of the voting  securities of KCS initially  acquired
by MM  pursuant  to the  Amended  Acquisition  Agreement;  or (ii)  three  years
following the effective date of the Stockholders' Agreement.

     The  Stockholders'  Agreement  also  requires the TMM Holders to vote their
shares of KCS in favor of the KCS Board of Directors' slate of director nominees
and against any proposal to remove any director  nominated by the KCS Nominating
and Corporate Governance  Committee (the "Nominating  Committee") and elected to
the KCS Board of Directors by KCS stockholders.  Subject to specific termination
provisions contained in the Stockholders'  Agreement,  the agreement (with a few
exceptions) terminates when the TMM Holders' ownership, for 30 consecutive days,
falls  below 40% of the 18 million  shares of KCS Common  Stock  acquired at the
Closing of the Acquisition.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     This  agreement  with TMM,  MM and  certain of the  Principal  Stockholders
provides TMM, MM, such  Principal  Stockholders  and Permitted  Transferees  (as
defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) (collectively, the "Holders") with
registration  rights with respect to shares of KCS Common Stock issued  pursuant
to the Amended  Acquisition  Agreement and the Consulting  Agreement  (described
below) and shares otherwise  acquired upon the exercise of pre-emptive rights in
compliance  with  the  Stockholders'  Agreement.   Pursuant  to  the  terms  and
conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Holders will have the right
to request at any time prior to the five year  anniversary of the effective date
of the  Registration  Rights Agreement up to six demand  registrations  upon the
request of Holders of 10% or more of the shares of Registrable  Stock.  However,
KCS will not be required to file more than one "shelf registration." The Holders
will also be entitled to unlimited incidental,  or "piggy-back,"  registrations.
This agreement also contains certain indemnification  provisions under which KCS
will be obligated to indemnify  certain  persons  against certain losses and KCS
will be entitled to indemnification against certain losses from the Holders.

CONSULTING AGREEMENT

     This agreement with Jose F. Serrano  International  Business,  S.A. de C.V.
(the  "Consulting  Firm")  provides for the Consulting  Firm to provide  certain
consulting  services to the KCS Board of Directors.  Jose F. Serrano  Segovia is
required under the terms of the Consulting  Agreement to be personally  involved
in the provision of services by the consulting  firm.  The Consulting  Agreement
has a term of three years  commencing  on the first  business day  following the
Closing Date. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Consulting  Agreement,
KCS will pay to the  Consulting  Firm an annual fee of  $3,000,000  in cash.  In
addition,  upon the resolution of certain disputes with the Mexican  government,
KCS will pay to the Consulting  Firm $9,000,000 (the "VAT Claim and Put Advisory
Fee"). Such amount may be paid, at KCS's election,  in cash or KCS Common Stock.
The Consulting  Agreement contains certain restrictions on transfer of shares of
KCS Common Stock.

MARKETING AND SERVICES AGREEMENT.

     This  agreement by and among TMM Logistics,  S.A. de C.V. ("TMM  Logistics"
and together with its subsidiaries,  affiliates and joint venture companies, the
"Parent  Group"),  TFM and The Kansas City Southern  Railway Company ("KCSR" and
together with its subsidiaries and affiliates the "KCS Group"),  provides, among
other things,  that the KCS Group will provide certain services to any member of
the Parent Group on terms which are no less favorable than the terms provided to
other  Logistics  Companies  (as defined in the  agreement),  subject to certain
exceptions. It also sets forth certain rights of the Parent Group to provide, be
preferred to provide,  or make a bid to provide,  certain services.  The initial
term of the Marketing and Services  Agreement is for five years beginning on the
Closing Date, and will be  automatically  renewed for periods of one year unless
terminated by the Parent Group or the KCS Group or automatically terminated. The
agreement  automatically  terminates  in  the  event  (i)  TMM  Logistics  files
bankruptcy proceedings,  or has filed against it any bankruptcy proceedings that
are not  dismissed or stayed  within 30 days, or (ii) a change of control of the
Parent  Group  occurs  and the  party  effecting  the  change  of  control  is a
competitor  of KCS. The agreement may also be terminated by TFM or the KCS Group
under certain

<PAGE>

circumstances.  This agreement also contains mutual  indemnification  provisions
against  losses  by an  indemnified  party  resulting  from  any  breach  of any
warranty, representation,  covenant or obligation of an indemnifying party under
the Marketing and Services Agreement.

AGREEMENT OF ASSIGNMENT  AND  ASSUMPTION OF RIGHTS,  AND AGENCY  AGREEMENT  WITH
UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL, DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS

     This  agreement  with TMM and Grupo TFM,  provides for the  assignment  and
transfer by TMM to KCS, and the  acceptance  and assumption by KCS, of TMM's and
Grupo TFM's rights,  duties and obligations  with respect to the purchase of the
TFM limited  voting shares from the Mexican  government  under the Put Agreement
(defined below). The potential  obligation to purchase the Mexican  government's
20% interest in TFM arises under the original TFM share purchase  agreement,  as
amended by an agreement entered into by and among the Federal  Government of the
United  Mexican  States,  Grupo  TFM,  TMM  and  KCS,  referred  to as the  "Put
Agreement."  Following an adverse final  resolution of the declaratory  judgment
lawsuit currently pending in Mexico seeking a judicial interpretation of the Put
obligation, or the lifting of the injunction issued by the Mexican court pending
its final  decision,  the Mexican  government may put its 20% interest in TFM to
Grupo TFM. In the event that Grupo TFM does not under those  circumstances  then
purchase the Mexican government's 20% interest in TFM, TMM and KCS, or either of
TMM or KCS alone,  would,  following  notification by the Mexican  government in
accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements, be obligated to purchase
the  Mexican  government's  remaining  interest in TFM.  If the  Acquisition  is
completed prior to the purchase of the Mexican government's interest in TFM, KCS
will be solely responsible for purchasing the Mexican  government's 20% interest
in TFM.

CERTAIN ANCILLARY  AGREEMENTS TO THE AMENDED  ACQUISITION  AGREEMENT AND CERTAIN
RELATED AGREEMENTS

     In connection with the Acquisition, KCS has entered into escrow agreements,
dated and effective as of December 15, 2004, that contain  provisions  regarding
the holding, in some cases the reduction,  and the release,  of cash,  documents
and securities placed into escrow.  These escrow agreements  include the Closing
Escrow Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and a VAT escrow agreement (the
"VAT  Escrow  Agreement,"  governing  the  holding  and release of a $40 million
promissory note (the "VAT Escrow Note") constituting part of the VAT Contingency
Payment)  and an escrow  agreement  governing  the  holding  and  release of the
$9,000,000  total amount of annual fee payable to Consulting Firm over the three
year term of the  Consulting  Agreement  (the  "Consulting  Compensation  Escrow
Agreement").  The other  parties to the  Closing  Escrow  Agreement  and the VAT
Escrow Agreement are KARA Sub, KCS Investment,  KCS Sub,  Caymex,  TMM, TMMH, MM
and The Bank of Nova Scotia of New York as the escrow  agent.  The other parties
to the Indemnity  Escrow  Agreement are KARA Sub, KCS Investment,  Caymex,  TMM,
TMMH, MM and The Bank of Nova Scotia of New York as the escrow agent.  The other
parties to the Consulting  Compensation Escrow Agreement are Consulting Firm and
The Bank of Nova Scotia of New York as escrow  agent.  KCS has also entered into
an agreement,  dated and effective as of December 15, 2004,  which  provides for
KCS to grant releases to certain  persons from all claims in connection with (i)
certain  powers of attorney  purportedly  granted by the TFM Board of Directors,
(ii) the purported approval by the Grupo TFM Board of Directors of the purported
execution of certain agreements by TFM, and (iii) the purported  ratification of
the TFM Board of Directors of the purported  execution of certain  agreements by
TFM (the  "Authority  Litigation").  The releases  will become  effective and be
released  from escrow to the parties  entitled to receive them at the Closing in
accordance  with the  terms  of the  Closing  Escrow  Agreement.  The  Authority
Litigation Agreement further provides that within 10 days after the Closing, KCS
will  request  that  actions  in  the  Authority   Litigation   against  certain
individuals be dismissed. KCS may reinitiate actions in the Authority Litigation
against the released persons under certain  circumstances.  In addition, KCS has
entered into an agreement,  dated and  effective as of December 15, 2004,  which
provides  for TMM,  TMMH and MM to  indemnify  certain KCS  indemnitees  against
losses from certain  proceedings  brought against any such KCS indemnitee by TMM
security holders in connection with the Acquisition.

ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

     As  noted  in  Item  1.01  above,  pursuant  to the  terms  of the  Amended
Acquisition  Agreement,  KCS  is  obligated  to  issue  at  the  Closing  of the
Acquisition 18,000,000 shares of KCS Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in
partial  consideration  for the shares of Grupo TFM being acquired by KCS in the
Acquisition.

<PAGE>

     Additionally,  as noted in Item  1.01  above,  on the later to occur of the
Closing of the Acquisition and the successful  resolution of certain proceedings
related to TFM's VAT claim and the Mexican government's Put, KCS is obligated to
pay up to $35 million of the VAT  Contingency  Payment,  reduced as set forth in
the Amended Acquisition  Agreement,  in shares of KCS Common Stock.  Pursuant to
the Amended Acquisition Agreement, at that time, KCS is obligated to issue up to
that number of shares of KCS Common Stock,  valued at the Volume  Weighted Price
(defined below), as equals $35 million (as it may be reduced).  Further,  KCS is
obligated to convert on the fifth anniversary of the Closing of the Acquisition,
or such earlier date as KCS deems appropriate,  the $40 million VAT Escrow Note,
as it may be reduced in  connection  with certain  indemnity  claims,  into that
number of shares of KCS Common Stock, valued at the Volume Weighted Price, equal
to the remaining  principal  amount of the VAT Escrow as of such date. Under the
Amended  Acquisition  Agreement,  the Volume  Weighted  Price  means the average
trading price per share for KCS Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange,  as
reported on the Bloomberg (VAP  function),  for the 20 consecutive  trading days
immediately  preceding the later of (i) the date of Closing of the  Acquisition,
or (ii) the date of the public  announcement  by KCS of the final  resolution of
the such proceedings. The exact number of shares of KCS Common Stock that KCS is
obligated to issue in  connection  with the VAT  Contingency  Payment  cannot be
determined until the later of the date of Closing of the Acquisition or the date
of such public announcement.

     KCS may, but is not  obligated to, issue shares of KCS Common Stock in lieu
of (i)  any  portion  of  the  $35  million  cash  payment  portion  of the  VAT
Contingency  Payment,  (ii) all or any portion of the remaining amount due under
the Indemnity  Escrow Notes and (iii) the  $9,000,000 VAT Claim and Put Advisory
Fee under the Consulting Agreement.

     All of the shares of KCS  Common  Stock  discussed  above will be issued in
reliance on the exemption from the  registration  requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 provided by Section  4(2).  The issuances of such shares by KCS does
not involve a public  offering of  securities  as the  issuances  are only to MM
pursuant  to the  Amended  Acquisition  Agreement  and, if so elected by KCS, to
Consulting Firm pursuant to the Consulting Agreement. Disposition of such shares
will be restricted by the Stockholders'  Agreement and the certificates for such
shares will bear a transfer restriction legend.

arrangement or composition for the benefit of creditors,  or for the appointment

     SECTION 5.4 AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION.

     (a) TMM, TMMH, MM and GTFM each has full  corporate  power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary  Agreements to which any of TMM, TMMH, MM or GTFM is
a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have  been  duly  and  validly  authorized  by all  requisite  action  on  their
respective  parts, and no other corporate action on the part of TMM, TMMH, MM or
GTFM,  as the case  may be,  is  necessary  to  approve  this  Agreement  or the
Ancillary  Agreements to which it is a party or to authorize or  consummate  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or  thereby,  other than  approvals  from the
shareholders of TMM, TMMH and MM, to be obtained as provided in Section 5.5. TMM
has  received the opinion of JP Morgan  Securities,  Inc. to the effect that the
consideration  to be received in the  Acquisition is fair from a financial point
of view to TMM. This  Agreement  and the  Ancillary  Agreements to which it is a
party have been duly and validly  executed and  delivered by TMM,  TMMH,  MM and
GTFM (except for those Ancillary  Agreements that are not dated the date hereof,
which  Ancillary  Agreements  shall be duly and validly  executed and  delivered
prior  to the

<PAGE>

Closing) and  (assuming  the due  authorization,  execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary  Agreements by the other Parties hereto and thereto)
constitute  valid and binding  obligations of TMM, TMMH, MM and GTFM (except for
those Ancillary Agreements that are not dated the date hereof or, by their terms
are  not  effective  at  the  date  hereof,  which  Ancillary  Agreements  shall
constitute  valid  and  binding  obligations  of TMM,  TMMH,  MM and GTFM at the
Closing or the effective date thereof, as the case may be),  enforceable against
TMM,  TMMH,  MM and GTFM in  accordance  with  their  terms,  except  as (i) the
enforceability  thereof may be subject to or limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium  or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights
of creditors  generally and the  availability  of equitable  relief  (whether in
proceedings  at law or in  equity),  and (ii) rights to  indemnification  may be
limited by the Securities Laws and the policies underlying such laws.

     (b) Neither the execution  and delivery of this  Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party by TMM, TMMH, MM or GTFM nor the  consummation
by TMM,  TMMH,  MM or GTFM of any of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  or
thereby to be performed by them,  nor  compliance by TMM,  TMMH, MM or GTFM with
any of the terms or provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) violate any provision
of the  Charter  or  Bylaws  of TMM,  TMMH or MM or the  Charter  or  Bylaws  or
comparable  organizational  documents  of GTFM or any GTFM  Subsidiary,  or (ii)
assuming  that the  consents and  approvals  referred to in Section 5.5 are duly
obtained,  (x) violate,  conflict with or require any notice,  filing,  consent,
waiver or approval  under any Applicable Law to which TMM, TMMH, MM, GTFM or the
GTFM Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, Contracts or assets are
subject,  or (y) violate,  conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of
or the loss of any benefit under,  constitute a default (or an event which, with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both,  would constitute a default) under,
result in the  termination of or a right of termination or  cancellation  under,
accelerate or result in a right of acceleration of the performance  required by,
result in the  creation of any  liability  under,  result in the creation of any
Encumbrance other than any Permitted Encumbrance upon the properties,  Contracts
or assets of TMM, TMMH, MM, GTFM or the GTFM Subsidiaries  under, or require any
notice, approval, waiver or consent under, any note, bond, mortgage,  indenture,
deed of trust,  license,  lease,  agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which TMM,  TMMH,  MM, GTFM or any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries  is a party,  or by
which  TMM,  TMMH,  MM,  GTFM or any of the  GTFM  Subsidiaries  or any of their
properties  or  assets  may be bound or  affected,  except,  in the case of this
clause (ii), would not have or be reasonably  expected to have,  individually or
in the aggregate,  a GTFM Material Adverse Effect or result in an Encumbrance on
the GTFM Shares.

     SECTION 5.5 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.

     (a) The  affirmative  vote of the holders of a majority of the  outstanding
shares of Series A Shares of TMM (the "TMM Stockholder  Approval"),  is the only
vote of the holders of any Security of TMM  necessary to approve this  Agreement
and the other  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the Ancillary
Agreements.  Holders of more than a majority of the outstanding shares of Series
A Shares of TMM have (i) entered into the Voting Trust with respect to 7,841,343
Series A Shares of TMM pursuant to which they have transferred such shares to an
irrevocable  trust for the  purpose of  assuring  that such  shares are voted in
favor of the

<PAGE>

TMM  Stockholder  Approval,  and (ii)  entered  into the  Amendment to the Trust
Agreement,  with respect to 574,150 Series A Shares of TMM pursuant to which the
settlors have irrevocably  instructed,  and the trustee under such agreement has
irrevocably agreed, to vote the shares in favor of the TMM Stockholder Approval.
The affirmative vote of the shares subject to the Voting Trust and the Amendment
to the Trust  Agreement,  when it occurs,  will be sufficient to constitute  TMM
Stockholder Approval.  The Voting Trust and Amendment to the Trust Agreement are
valid  and  binding  obligations  of the  signatories  thereto,  enforceable  in
accordance with their terms.  The affirmative  vote of the holders of a majority
of the  outstanding  shares  of  capital  stock of TMMH (the  "TMMH  Stockholder
Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any Security of TMMH  necessary to
approve this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the  Ancillary  Agreements  and the  affirmative  vote of the  holders  of a
majority of the  outstanding  shares of capital stock of MM (the "MM Stockholder
Approval")  is the only vote of the holders of any  Security of MM  necessary to
approve this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements  (collectively,  the "Subsidiary Approvals").  As a
part of the TMM Stockholder Approval, TMM, as holder owning all (but one) of the
shares of TMMH entitled to vote,  will be irrevocably  instructed to irrevocably
vote all such shares in favor of the TMMH Stockholder Approval. As a part of the
TMMH Stockholder Approval,  TMMH, as holder of more than 91% of the shares of MM
entitled to vote, will be irrevocably instructed to irrevocably vote such shares
in favor of the MM Stockholder Approval.

     (b) Except (i) as set forth in Section 5.5(a), in Section 5.5 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or in the Ancillary  Agreements,  (ii) the prior approval of
the Mexican  Foreign  Investments  Commission,  (iii)  clearance  by the Mexican
Antitrust Commission,  (iv) notice to the Mexican Ministry of Communications and
Transportation, (v) compliance with and filings under the Securities Laws as may
be required in connection  with this Agreement and the Ancillary  Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (vi) any required filings with
the NYSE,  (vii)  the  filing of the  Certificate  of  Merger,  and  (viii)  the
expiration or earlier  termination  of the waiting  period under the HSR Act, no
consents or approvals of, or filings,  declarations  or  registrations  with any
Governmental Authority, any third party or any other Person are necessary on the
part of the Sellers in connection with the execution and delivery by each Seller
of this  Agreement or the  Ancillary  Agreements  to which it is a party and the
consummation  by the  Sellers  of the  Acquisition  and the  other  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the Ancillary  Agreements  other than such
consents,  approvals,  filings,  declarations  or  registrations  which  if  not
obtained  would not  reasonably be expected to delay  materially  the Closing or
have a GTFM  Material  Adverse  Effect.  To the best of Sellers'  Knowledge,  no
control  share,  anti-takeover  or similar  statute under the Laws of the UMS is
applicable  to  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby  or  by  the  Ancillary
Agreements.

     SECTION 5.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS;  UNDISCLOSED  LIABILITIES.  Except as set
forth in Section  5.6 or Section  5.11 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule,  the
audited   consolidated   financial  statements  of  GTFM  and  its  consolidated
Subsidiaries and the audited  consolidated  financial  statements of TFM and its
consolidated  subsidiaries  for the period ended  December 31, 2003,  previously
provided  to KCS  (the  "GTFM  Financial  Statements")  present  fairly,  in all
material respects, in conformity with IFRS applied on a consistent basis (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto),  the consolidated  financial position
of GTFM and its  consolidated  Subsidiaries  as of the dates  thereof  and their
consolidated  results of  operations  and cash flows for the periods then ended.
The  reconciliation  ("Reconciliation")  to U.S.  GAAP  from  IFRS  of the  GTFM
Financial  Statements  prepared by  PriceWaterhouseCoopers,  provided by GTFM to
KCS,  fairly  presents in all  material  respects all  adjustments  necessary to
reflect the  presentation  of such  financial  statements  on a U.S. GAAP basis.
Except as set forth in the GTFM  Financial  Statements,  neither GTFM nor any of
its  Subsidiaries  has any  liabilities or  obligations  of any nature  (whether
accrued, absolute,  contingent or otherwise) required by IFRS to be set forth on
a consolidated  balance sheet of GTFM and the consolidated  GTFM Subsidiaries or
in  the  notes  thereto  or  which,  individually  or in  the  aggregate,  could
reasonably be expected to have a GTFM Material Adverse Effect.


     SECTION 5.7 CONTRACTS.

     (a) Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate  list  or  description,  as of  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  of all
Contracts:  (i) pursuant to which GTFM or any of the GTFM Subsidiaries is either
obligated  to pay or  entitled  to receive in excess of $10  million in any year
(that is not otherwise  required to be disclosed  pursuant to this Section 5.7),
(ii) that are employment,  management,  consulting or severance  agreements with
any  officer or  director  of GTFM or any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries,  (iii) that
include any noncompetition or nonsolicitation  covenant or any exclusive dealing
or  similar  arrangement  that  limits  the  ability  of GTFM or any of the GTFM
Subsidiaries to compete (geographically or otherwise) in any line of business or
which would so limit the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries  after the
Effective  Time,  (iv)  that  are  trackage  rights  agreements,   interline  or
interchange   agreements   with  other   railroads,   or  (v)  that   constitute
nondisclosure agreements or confidentiality agreements which could reasonably be
expected to have a significant effect on the conduct of the GTFM Business or the
business of the Surviving Company ((i) through (v) collectively,  the "Scheduled
Contracts").

     (b) As of the date of this Agreement,  each of the Scheduled Contracts is a
legal, valid and binding  obligation of GTFM or the GTFM Subsidiaries  (assuming
the due authorization,  execution and delivery by the other Parties thereto) and
is in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting  creditors generally and by
the  availability  of equitable  remedies  (whether in  proceedings at law or in
equity).

     (c) As of the  date of this  Agreement,  neither  GTFM  nor any of the GTFM
Subsidiaries  has received  notice of cancellation of or default under or intent
to cancel  or call a default  under  any of the  Scheduled  Contracts.  Assuming
receipt of the consents and  approvals  set forth in Section 5.5, to the best of
the Sellers'  Knowledge,  nothing has occurred  which with or without

<PAGE>

notice  or lapse of time or both  would  constitute  a  material  breach of or a
material default under any of the Scheduled Contracts.

     (d) On  and  after  the  Closing  Date,  GTFM,  TFM  and  their  respective
Subsidiaries  shall have no liability or obligation under or with respect to any
agreement or arrangement with Jose Joaquin de Teresa y Polignac ("De Teresa") or
any of its affiliates  (the "De Teresa  Agreements")  other than pursuant to the
ongoing  litigation  matters  identified in Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the "Ongoing Litigation Matters"). Since May 17, 2004 through the date
of this  Agreement,  (i) no amount  has been paid by or on behalf of GTFM or any
GTFM Subsidiary to De Teresa other than for Ongoing Litigation Matters, and (ii)
the amounts paid or payable for the Ongoing Litigation Matters have not exceeded
the amount set forth in Section 5.7(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 5.8 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

     (a) With respect to all  Intellectual  Property  used in the conduct of the
GTFM  Business,  GTFM or a GTFM  Subsidiary  either  has all  right,  title  and
interest in or valid and binding rights under Contract to use such  Intellectual
Property,  except where the failure to have such rights would not  reasonably be
expected to have a GTFM Material Adverse Effect.  Except as disclosed in Section
5.8 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a GTFM Material Adverse Effect, (i) all registrations with and applications
to Governmental Authorities in respect of Intellectual Property owned by GTFM or
any GTFM  Subsidiary  are valid and in full force and effect,  (ii) there are no
material restrictions on the direct or indirect transfer of any Contract, or any
interest  therein,  held by GTFM  or any  GTFM  Subsidiary  in  respect  of such
Intellectual  Property,  (iii) to the Knowledge of the Sellers  neither GTFM nor
any GTFM Subsidiary is in default (or with the giving of notice or lapse of time
or both,  would be in default) in any material respect under any Contract to use
such  Intellectual  Property,  and (iv) to the  Knowledge of the  Sellers,  such
Intellectual  Property  owned  by  GTFM  or any  GTFM  Subsidiary  is not  being
infringed by any other Person. Neither GTFM nor any GTFM Subsidiary has received
notice that GTFM or any GTFM  Subsidiary is  infringing in any material  respect
any Intellectual  Property of any other Person, to the Knowledge of Sellers,  no
claim is pending or has been made to such effect that has not been resolved and,
to the  Knowledge  of the  Sellers,  neither  GTFM  nor any GTFM  Subsidiary  is
infringing  any  Intellectual  Property of any other Person the effect of which,
individually  or in the aggregate,  could  reasonably be expected to have a GTFM
Material Adverse Effect. GTFM owns and will own at the Closing, all right, title
and interest in and to that certain  trademark of mixed type registered with the
Mexican  Institute  of  Industrial  Property  under number  53951,  class 37, in
connection with the name "TFM" and its design.

     SECTION 5.9 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS.

     (a) Section  5.9 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a true and
complete  list  of each  material  pension  plan,  deferred  compensation  plan,
retirement  income plan,  stock option or stock  purchase  plan,  profit sharing
plan, bonus plan or policy, employee group insurance plan, hospitalization plan,
disability  plan or other employee  benefit plan,  program,  policy or practice,

<PAGE>

formal or  informal,  funded or  unfunded,  to any  current or former  director,
officer or employee (or to any dependent or beneficiary  thereof) of GTFM or any
GTFM  Subsidiary  under  which GTFM or any GTFM  Subsidiary  has any  present or
future material obligation or liability, whether actual or contingent. Each such
plan,  agreement,  program,  policy and  arrangement  shall be  referred to as a
"Benefit  Plan." Each Benefit Plan is further  designated  in Section 5.9 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule as either currently or formerly maintained, sponsored
or contributed  to by GTFM or any GTFM  Subsidiary (a "GTFM Benefit Plan") or by
any other entity (in which case such entity is identified). Neither GTFM nor any
GTFM  Subsidiary,  nor to the Knowledge of Sellers,  any other  Person,  has any
express or implied  commitment,  whether legally  enforceable or not, to modify,
change  or  terminate  any GTFM  Benefit  Plan,  other  than with  respect  to a
modification, change or termination required by Applicable Law.

     (b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, GTFM has delivered or made available
to KCS true, current,  correct and complete copies of (i) each Benefit Plan (or,
if not written,  a written  summary of its material  terms),  including all plan
documents,  adoption agreements, trust agreements,  insurance Contracts or other
funding vehicles and all amendments thereto, (ii) any summaries and summary plan
descriptions,  including any summary of material  modifications,  distributed to
Benefit  Plan  participants,  (iii) the most  recent  actuarial  report or other
financial  statement relating to such Benefit Plan, as applicable,  and (iv) all
filings made with any Governmental Authorities with respect to any Benefit Plan.

     (c) Each Benefit Plan has been administered in material compliance with its
terms and all  Applicable  Laws and material  contributions  required to be made
under the  terms of any of the  Benefit  Plans as of the date of this  Agreement
have been timely made or, if not yet due,  have been  properly  reflected in the
GTFM  Financial  Statements.  With  respect to the Benefit  Plans,  no event has
occurred and there exists no condition  or set of  circumstances  in  connection
with  which GTFM could be subject  to any  material  liability  (other  than for
liabilities  to pay  benefits)  under the terms of,  or with  respect  to,  such
Benefit Plans, or any Applicable Law.

     (d) Except as disclosed in Section 5.9 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule:
(i) there has been no prohibited  transaction  (within the meaning of Applicable
Law) with respect to any Benefit Plan that could result in material liability to
GTFM or the Surviving  Company,  (ii) subject to compliance with Applicable Law,
each Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms,  without material  liability (other
than  liability for ordinary  administrative  expenses  typically  incurred in a
termination event), (iii) no suit,  administrative  proceeding,  action or other
litigation  has been  brought or, to the  Knowledge of Sellers,  is  threatened,
against or with respect to any such Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry
by any  Governmental  Authority,  (iv)  all  tax,  annual  reporting  and  other
governmental  filings  required  have been  timely  filed  with the  appropriate
Governmental Authority and all notices and disclosures have been timely provided
to   participants,   and  (v)  each  Benefit  Plan  meets  the  requirement  for
deductibility under the Law and regulations of the UMS.

<PAGE>

     (e) No Benefit Plan exists,  and no other  payment shall be made that, as a
result of the execution of this Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated  by
this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with a subsequent  event),  could
result in the  payment to any  employee  of the GTFM Group of any money or other
property or could  result in the  increase,  acceleration  or  provision  of any
payments, other rights or benefits to any such employee.

     SECTION 5.10 LABOR AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

     (a) Sellers have delivered to KCS a complete and accurate list (giving name
and current payroll  compensation)  of each current  employee of each company in
the GTFM Group as of the date of this Agreement.  Except as set forth in Section
5.10 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule,  none of the members of the GTFM Group
has any  responsibility  or liability to any of its employees for any delinquent
payments of wages, salaries,  commissions,  bonuses or other direct compensation
for any services  performed for it or amounts  required to be reimbursed to such
employee  or  paid to such  employee  for  mandatory  profit  sharing,  housing,
mandatory  retirement  benefits,  vacation  benefits or social security benefits
required  under the Laws of the UMS in an amount that would have a GTFM Material
Adverse Effect.

     (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.10 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule
or as would not reasonably be expected to have a GTFM Material  Adverse  Effect,
each of the  members of the GTFM  Group (i) are in  compliance  in all  material
respects with all Applicable Law respecting labor, employment, immigration, fair
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, workers' compensation,
occupational  safety,  plant  closings,  wages  and  hours  and  any  other  Law
applicable to any of their employees, and (ii) has withheld all amounts required
by Applicable Law or by agreement to be withheld from the wages,  salaries,  and
other payments to employees, and (iii) is not liable for any arrears of wages or
any Taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

     (c) Except as set forth in Section 5.10 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule
or,  with  respect to notices  received  after the date hereof by TMM or any TMM
Subsidiaries,  disclosed  in  writing  to KCS prior to the  Closing,  no current
officer of any member of the GTFM Group has given  written  notice to TMM or any
TMM Subsidiary of such person's termination of employment with the GTFM Group.

     (d) Except as described in Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
the Mexican Railway Workers Union (EL SINDICATO DE TRABAJADORES  FERROCARRILEROS
DE LA REPUBLICA  MEXICANA)  is the only trade union or labor union  representing
any  employees of GTFM or any GTFM  Subsidiary.  Sellers have  provided to KCS a
true and complete copy of the collective bargaining agreement and any amendments
thereof.  Neither  GTFM  nor any of the  GTFM  Subsidiaries  is a  party,  or is
otherwise subject, to any other collective  bargaining  agreement or other labor
union contract applicable to its employees.  There are no material activities or
proceedings by a labor union or representative thereof to organize any employees
of GTFM or any of the GTFM Subsidiaries.  Except as set forth in Section 5.10 of
the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,  there are no pending negotiations between GTFM
or any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries

<PAGE>

and any labor union or  representative  thereof  regarding any proposed material
changes to any existing collective  bargaining  agreement and no such collective
bargaining  agreement is subject to expiration or renewal  within one year after
the date hereof or the extension or renewal of such an agreement or the entering
of any such  agreement.  Except  as set  forth  in  Section  5.10 of the  Seller
Disclosure  Schedule,  there are no pending, and none of GTFM or any of the GTFM
Subsidiaries has experienced  since March 31, 2004 any, material labor disputes,
lockouts,  strikes,  slowdowns,  work stoppages,  or threats thereof nor, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, has any event occurred or does any circumstance exist that
would  provide  a  reasonable  basis  for any  such  dispute,  lockout,  strike,
slowdown,  work stoppage or threat thereof.  Except as set forth in Section 5.10
of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule,  GTFM and the GTFM  Subsidiaries are not in
default  and  have  not  breached  in any  material  respect  the  terms  of any
applicable collective bargaining or other labor union contract, and there are no
material  claims  or  grievances  outstanding  against  GTFM,  any of  the  GTFM
Subsidiaries,  or any of their respective  employees under any such agreement or
contract.

     (e) Except as specified in Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,

Sellers  threatened,  between GTFM or any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries,  on the one
hand, and any of their  employees,  on the other hand, and (ii) to the Knowledge
of Sellers,  there are no facts or  circumstances  involving  any employee  that
would  form the  basis  of, or give  rise to,  any  cause of  action,  including
unlawful termination based on discrimination of any kind, except in case of such
clause (i) or (ii) as would not reasonably be expected to have,  individually or
in the aggregate, a GTFM Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.11 TAX MATTERS.

     (a) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule
or as would not have a GTFM Material Adverse Effect, all Tax Returns and reports
of GTFM and the GTFM Subsidiaries  required to be filed on or before the Closing

with the appropriate  Taxing Authorities and all such Tax Returns were complete,
correct and accurate. All Taxes shown on such Tax Returns as owed by GTFM or the
GTFM Subsidiaries have been paid.

     (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,

deficiency  or  assessment  from any Taxing  Authority  with respect to material
liabilities  for Taxes of GTFM or any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries  which  have not
been paid or  finally  settled.  No claim has ever  been made in  writing  by an
authority in a jurisdiction  where GTFM or any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries  do not
file Tax  Returns  that such  entity is or may be  subject to  taxation  by that
jurisdiction.  Except  as set forth in  Section  5.11 of the  Seller  Disclosure
Schedule,  no  audit  of any  Tax  Return  concerning  GTFM  or any of the  GTFM
Subsidiaries  is  pending,  being  conducted,  or to the  Knowledge  of Sellers,

Subsidiaries other than liens for current Taxes (i) not yet due and payable,  or
(ii) that would not have a GTFM Material Adverse Effect.

     (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
neither GTFM nor any of the GTFM Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of
any other Person as a transferee or successor,  by Contract,  for withholding or
otherwise.

     (e) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
there are no Tax sharing or Tax  indemnity  agreements  or similar  arrangements

agreements  among GTFM and the GTFM  Subsidiaries in which GTFM owns directly or
indirectly all equity interest.

     (f) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
each of GTFM and the GTFM  Subsidiaries  has complied in all  material  respects
with all applicable  governmental rules relating to the payment,  collection and
withholding of Taxes.

     (g) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
there is no Tax  litigation  pending or to the  Knowledge of Sellers  threatened
against GTFM and/or the GTFM Subsidiaries.

     (h) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
neither  GTFM nor any of the GTFM  Subsidiaries  will  suffer  any  adverse  tax
consequences  under  the  Laws of the  UMS  from  ceasing,  as a  result  of the
Acquisition, to be members of the TMM consolidated group.

     (i) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule,
during the period from the date of the GTFM Financial  Statements until the date

qualified  to do  business  in each  jurisdiction  in which  the  nature  of the
business  conducted  by it or the  character or location of the  properties  and
assets  owned,  leased or operated by it makes such  qualification  or licensing
necessary,  except  in  jurisdictions  where  the  failure  of such  license  or
qualification  would not  individually  or in the aggregate  have a KCS Material
Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 6.2 AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION.

     (a) Each of KCS,  KARA Sub,  KCS Sub,  KCS  Investment  and Caymex has full
corporate  power and  authority  to execute and deliver this  Agreement  and the

except  as (i) the  enforceability  thereof  may be  subject  to or  limited  by

entitled  to  the  benefits  and  rights  set  forth  in  the   Certificate   of
Incorporation of KCS, as in effect at the Effective Time.

     SECTION 6.3 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.

Acquisition  or the other  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

     (c) The Board of  Directors  of KCS (the "KCS  Board")  has  approved  this
Agreement,  the Ancillary Agreements,  and the Acquisition  contemplated herein,
including the issuance of more than 15% of the  outstanding  voting stock of KCS
pursuant  to the  Acquisition,  to  ensure  that the  restrictions  on  business
combinations  set forth in Section 203 of the Del. G.C.L.  will not apply to the
Acquisition or to the consummation of the other transactions referred to in this
Agreement and the Ancillary  Agreements  (including  the exercise of pre-emptive
rights under and in accordance with the terms of the  Stockholders'  Agreement).
Prior to Closing, KCS shall take all corporate action necessary to amend the KCS
Stockholder Rights Plan so that the acquisition of the KCS Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement and the Ancillary  Agreements  will not constitute a "trigger
event" under the KCS  Stockholder  Rights Plan. To the best of KCS's  Knowledge,
except for Section 203 of the Del.  G.C.L.,  no control share,  anti-takeover or
similar  statute  under the laws of any state in the United States is applicable
to the acquisition of KCS Common Stock contemplated  hereby and by the Ancillary
Agreements.

including  persons  named by KCS as directors or alternate  directors of GTFM or

its  Subsidiaries  has been  maintained  in  compliance  with its  terms and the
requirements  of  any  applicable  statutes,   orders,  rules  and  regulations,
including,  but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. No  prohibited  transaction,
within  the  meaning of Section  406 of ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code,  has

local and foreign tax returns which have been required to be filed and have paid
all Taxes shown thereon and all  assessments  received by them or any of them to
the extent that such Taxes have become due and are not being  contested  in good
faith,  except  as  would  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a KCS
Material  Adverse  Effect.  Except  as  disclosed  in  Section  6.15  of the KCS
Disclosure  Schedule,  there  is no Tax  deficiency  which  has  been  or  might
reasonably  be expected to be asserted or  threatened  against KCS or any of its
Subsidiaries,  except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a KCS

Applicable  Laws or orders of any  Governmental  Authority,  except as would not
reasonably  be  expected to have a KCS  Material  Adverse  Effect.  No event has
occurred  or exists  that would  (with or without  notice or lapse of time) give
rise  to any  obligation  on the  part  of  KCS  or any of its  Subsidiaries  to
undertake  or to bear all or any portion of the cost of any  remedial  action of
any nature which would  reasonably  be expected to have a KCS  Material  Adverse
Effect.

case, all applicable

<PAGE>

Environmental  Laws, (ii) hold all  Environmental  Permits  necessary to conduct
their  current  operations,  and (iii) are in compliance  with their  respective
Environmental Permits, except where the failure to hold or be in compliance with
such  Environmental  Permits  would not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a KCS
Material  Adverse Effect.  Neither KCS nor any of its  Subsidiaries has received
any written notice,  demand,  letter,  claim or request for information alleging
that KCS or any of its Subsidiaries may be in violation of, or liable under, any
Environmental  Law,  except where the preceding would not reasonably be expected

any judgment, decree or judicial order relating to compliance with Environmental
Laws,  Environmental  Permits  or  the  investigation,   sampling,   monitoring,
treatment,  remediation,  removal  or  cleanup  of  Hazardous  Materials  and no

indemnitor  or has assumed  liability  in  connection  with any pending  demand,
notice,  claim,  or  other  allegation,  or to  the  Knowledge  of KCS  and  its
Subsidiaries, any claim threatened by or against any third-party relating to any
liability under any  Environmental  Law or relating to any Hazardous  Materials,
except  as would not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a KCS  Material  Adverse
Effect.  None of the real property  owned or leased or operated by KCS or any of
its  Subsidiaries  is listed or, to the  Knowledge of KCS and its  Subsidiaries,
proposed  for  listing  on any  list of  sites  maintained  by any  Governmental
Authority requiring  investigation or cleanup, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a KCS Material Adverse Effect.

marketable title to, or valid and enforceable leasehold,  easement or concession
interests in, all of its properties and tangible assets necessary to conduct the
KCS Business as it is currently conducted, except where the failure to have such
title or  interest  would not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a KCS  Material
Adverse Effect. All such property and assets which constitute personal property,
equipment,  and fixtures, are in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear
excepted. Each of KCS and its Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects
with the terms of all  leases and  concessions  to which it is a party and under
which it is in occupancy,  and all such leases and concessions are in full force
and effect,  except in each case as would not  reasonably  be expected to have a
KCS Material Adverse Effect.

     (i) be made solely at the express  written  request of Jose  Vicente  Corta
     Fernandez or an officer of KCS, and (ii) be made  through  Carlos  Galvan 0
     Duque or EMVA.  TMM shall assure that if the FIC  communicates  with any of
     the TMM  Parties,  that party  shall  promptly  notify Jose  Vicente  Corta
     Fernandez of the communication and shall direct the FIC to communicate with
     Carlos Galvan Duque or EMVA for a response, and that Carlos Galvan Duque or
     EMVA shall  consult with KCS before  responding to the FIC or providing any
     documents or other  information to the FIC concerning this Agreement or the
     FIC Approval.

          (iv) All references in this Section 7.4(e) to  communications  with or
     by the FIC shall include  communications with members of the FIC, including
     officers of the Ministry of Communication and Transport (SCT), the Ministry
     of   Economy,   and  the   Ministry   of  Finance  but  shall  not  include
     communications  in the ordinary course of business of TMM or the GTFM Group
     that do not concern this Agreement or the FIC Approval provided, that if in
     the course of such  communications the subject of this Agreement or the FIC
     Approval is raised,  no discussions  concerning those subjects are held and

     Fernandez (unless Jose Vicente Corta Fernandez requests otherwise).

Acquisition.

     SECTION 7.5 STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS.

     (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in any

file  with the SEC an  amended  proxy  statement  for a special  meeting  of its
stockholders to be called to obtain the KCS  Stockholder  Approval and shall use
its commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain clearance of such proxy statement

matters set forth therein as requiring  such  approval,  including  recommending
such approval to its

<PAGE>

stockholders, PROVIDED that the KCS Board may withdraw its recommendation of the
Acquisition  if it is advised by counsel to the effect  that  because of a third
party proposal  occurring after the date of the KCS Board's initial  approval of
the  Acquisition,  for the KCS Board to continue to  recommend  the  Acquisition
would be a breach of the KCS Board's fiduciary duties to the KCS stockholders.

     SECTION 7.13 VAT CONTINGENCY PAYMENT.

<PAGE>

     (a) On the  later to  occur  of (i) the  Closing  Date,  or (ii) the  Final
Resolution  of the VAT  Claim and Put,  KCS  shall pay the sum of $110  million,
reduced  (but not below zero) by: (i) any cash  payments  required to be made by
KCS, TFM or any of their respective  Affiliates  (including for purposes of this
Section 7.13, GTFM) to any agency of the Mexican  government to obtain the Final
Resolution of the VAT Claim and Put, net of any cash  payments  received by KCS,
TFM or such Affiliates  from any such agency related to the Final  Resolution of
the VAT Claim and Put,  (ii) the NOL Value,  (iii) 67% of the face amount of any
other Tax credits  under the Laws of the UMS which TFM or any of its  Affiliates
is required to apply,  use or relinquish to the Mexican  government  without any
value  received in exchange  therefor  (other than the value  resulting from the
Final  Resolution of the VAT Claim and Put),  to obtain the Final  Resolution of
the VAT Claim and Put,  and (iv) any Taxes  incurred  with  respect to the Final
Resolution of the VAT Claim and Put which are not offset by the NOL Value or the
other Tax credits referred to in Section  7.13(a)(iii),  and (v) the contingency
fees, in an amount of $1,500,000  each (but not any portion of the ongoing legal
fees and  expenses)  to the extent  they are  required to be paid by GTFM or any
GTFM  Subsidiary to (y) Rocha y Asociados,  S.C.,  or Zambrano,  Rocha y Espina,
S.C.  in  connection  with  the  successful  resolution  of the  Put and (z) CEA
Abogados,  S.C., in connection  with the successful  resolution of the VAT Claim
(the "VAT Contingency  Payment").  The VAT Contingency  Payment shall be paid as
follows:  (i) $35 million shall be paid in cash;  (ii) $35 million shall be paid
by  delivery  of that  number of shares of KCS  Common  Stock as,  valued at the
Volume  Weighted  Price,  shall be equal to $35  million,  and (iii) $40 million
shall be paid by  deposit  into  escrow  (the "VAT  Escrow"),  to be held and be
subject to reduction in accordance  with the terms of an escrow  agreement  (the
"VAT Escrow Agreement"), of a note in the principal amount of $40 million, which
shall be  converted at the fifth  anniversary  of the Closing  Date,  or at such
earlier date following the date that is two (2) years after the Final Resolution
of the VAT Claim and Put as KCS may, in its sole  discretion,  deem  appropriate
after consultation with a Tax consultant  knowledgeable  about Mexican Tax Laws,
into that number of shares of KCS Common Stock as, valued at the Volume Weighted
Price, shall be equal to the remaining  principal amount of the VAT Escrow as of
such date. Any reduction in the VAT Contingency Payment pursuant to this Section
7.13(a) shall be made in equal  proportions  in the amounts set forth in clauses
(i) through (iii) in the immediately preceding sentence. KCS may at its election
deliver shares of KCS Common Stock valued at the Volume  Weighted Price, in lieu
of any portion of the cash payment. The term "NOL Value" means 23% of the amount
of any  net  operating  losses  available  to TFM  and  its  Subsidiaries  under
applicable Tax Laws of the UMS which are relinquished to the Mexican  government
by TFM and its Affiliates without any other value received therefor. .

     (b)  KCS  shall  have  the  exclusive  right  to  manage  the  negotiation,
prosecution  and  settlement  of the VAT  Claim  and  any  extensions  or  other
modifications  of the  obligations  under  the Put and in  doing  so  shall  act
prudently  and in good faith.  As used in this section,  "prudently"  shall mean
acting as a reasonably prudent person would act in dealing with its own property
and without regard to the obligation to make the VAT  Contingency  Payment.  TMM
shall,  and shall  use its  reasonable  best  efforts  to cause its  Affiliates,
officers,  directors, agents and attorneys-in-fact to, cooperate with KCS in any
matters  reasonably  required  by KCS in  connection  with  these  negotiations;
PROVIDED  TMM and its  Affiliates  shall not be  required  to pay any amounts or

<PAGE>

relinquish  any assets,  Tax credits or other Tax  attributes  or other items of
value.  TMM,  TMMH  and  MM,  hereby  release  KCS,  its  Affiliates,  officers,
directors, agents and attorneys-in-fact from any and all claims, liabilities and
obligations  arising out of or in connection with the negotiations or settlement
with the Federal  Government  of the UMS with  respect to the VAT Claim and Put,
except  for any  breach of the  obligation  to pay the VAT  Contingency  Payment
pursuant to Section 7.13(a) or any breach of its obligations  under this Section
7.13(b).

     SECTION 7.14 FINANCING FOR  ACQUISITION.  In connection  with the financing
for the  Acquisition  (including any amounts due under Section 7.13),  KCS shall
not,  and  shall  cause  its  Subsidiaries  not to,  enter  into  any  financing
arrangements   that   materially  (i)  restrict  the  ability  of  KCS  and  its
Subsidiaries to make any payments required to be made by this Agreement, or (ii)
deny or restrict in any material way any material  rights  granted to TMM or any
of its Subsidiaries under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

controlled Affiliates, including persons named by them as directors or alternate
directors  of GTFM or any  GTFM  Subsidiary,  shall  initiate,  file,  commence,
publicly  threaten  to  initiate,  file  or  commence,  or  continue  to  pursue
(collectively, "Commence") any proceedings previously filed, except as necessary
in the  opinion of their  counsel  to avoid  dismissal  or adverse  ruling or to
preserve or exercise  rights  arising  under this  Agreement,  before any court,
arbitral  panel,  regulatory  body or other  agency or body  which,  directly or
indirectly,  is based upon or arises out of, in whole or in part,  the  Original
Acquisition  Agreement or the  transactions  referred to therein  (collectively,
"Acquisition  Agreement  Claims")  or any claim or  allegation  with  respect to
actions  taken or meetings  held prior to the date of this  Agreement  by, or in
their capacity as, the directors, officers, employees, shareholders or agents of
TMM, KCS, or any Subsidiary of TMM or KCS (collectively, "Management Claims").

     (b) The  Acquisition  Agreement  Claims and the Management  Claims shall be
dismissed, or may be reinstated, as follows:

          (i) If  this  Agreement  is  terminated  in  accordance  with  Section
     9.1(a)(i), then the Acquisition Agreement Claims and the Management Claims,
     and if the termination is in accordance with Section 9.1(a)(vii), then only
     the Acquisition  Agreement Claims, shall be dismissed with prejudice.  Each
     Party shall make all filings necessary, and shall take all steps reasonably
     requested  by the other  Parties,  to effect such  dismissal on the date of
     such termination or as soon thereafter as possible, with each Party to bear
     its own costs and expenses.

          (ii) If the Agreement is terminated other than as described in Section
     7.15(b)(i),  then, upon termination,  the Acquisition  Agreement Claims and
     the Management  Claims which were suspended as described in Section 7.15(a)

<PAGE>

     any other related claims  (whether as  cross-claims  or otherwise))  may be
     Commenced.

          (iii) If the  Agreement is not  terminated,  then on the Closing Date,
     the  Acquisition  Agreement  Claims  and the  Management  Claims  shall  be
     dismissed with prejudice.  Each Party shall make all filings necessary, and
     shall take all steps reasonably  requested by the other Parties,  to effect
     such dismissal on the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as possible,  with
     each Party to bear its own costs and expenses.

     (c) Within ten days after the date of this  Agreement,  the  Parties  shall
cause their  respective  litigation  counsel to inform the American  Arbitration
Association  of the  suspension of  proceedings in the matter styled KANSAS CITY
SOUTHERN AND KARA SUB, INC. V. GRUPO TMM, S.A.; TMM HOLDINGS,  S.A. DE C.V.; AND
TMM  MULTIMODAL,  S.A. DE C.V., No. 50 T 181 00514 03 (the  "Arbitration").  The
Arbitration  shall be held in abeyance,  but not dismissed or terminated,  until
the  Closing  Date.  Immediately  following  Closing  or, if this  Agreement  is
terminated  as  described  in  Section  7.15(b)(i)  on a  basis  which  requires
dismissal  of  Acquisition   Agreement   Claims,   immediately   following  such
termination,  the Parties  shall cause their  respective  litigation  counsel to
request  that the  Arbitration  be  terminated  and shall take all other  action
necessary to have the Arbitration  terminated as promptly as possible,  with the
Parties to bear their own costs and  expenses.  If this  Agreement is terminated
other than as  described  in Section  7.15(b)(i),  then any Party may  reinstate
proceedings in the Arbitration,  request a hearing and,  reinstate or pursue any
claims it may have in such proceeding (whether as a counter-claim or otherwise).

     (d) On the date of this  Agreement,  KCS and TMM,  each on behalf of itself
and its  controlled  Affiliates,  have  entered  into  Releases,  which shall be
deposited  in  the  Closing  Escrow  immediately  following  execution  of  this
Agreement.  The  Releases  shall  become  effective  on the Closing  Date and be
released from the Closing Escrow to the parties  entitled to receive them at the
Closing in accordance with the terms of the Closing Escrow Agreement;  PROVIDED,
that if this  Agreement is  terminated  as described in to Section  7.15(b) on a
basis which requires  dismissal of Acquisition  Agreement  Claims and Management
Claims,  then, at the effective time of such termination,  the Releases relating
to the claims to be dismissed  shall become  effective  and be released from the
Closing  Escrow to the Parties  entitled to receive them. The Parties agree that
the  Releases  shall not release  Sellers from any  indemnification  obligations
under Article 10 of this Agreement.

     (e) Within ten (10) days after  execution  of this  Agreement,  the Parties
will cause their respective litigation counsel to jointly file briefs before any
relevant authority to suspend, except for the Authority Litigation,  any pending
civil  litigation  either as a pre-judgment  measure (MEDIDA  CAUTELAR) or as an
Ordinary  Commercial  Proceeding as described in the "Mexican  Litigation  List"
attached  hereto as  Exhibit K. The  Parties  acknowledge  that the  suspensions
previously  obtained  in those  proceedings  (which  are in  effect  on the date
hereof) will remain in full force and effect during the suspension  period.  The
proceedings  described  in the  "Mexican  Litigation  List"  shall  be  held  in
abeyance, but not dismissed or terminated, until the Closing

<PAGE>

Date. Upon Closing, or a termination of this Agreement as referred to in Section
7.15(b)(i),  the  Parties  will cause  their  respective  litigation  counsel to
jointly  request that,  except for the  Authority  Litigation,  the  proceedings
described in the "Mexican  Litigation  List" be terminated  in  accordance  with
Section  7.15(b)(i),  with the Parties to bear their own costs and expenses.  If
for any  reason  this  Agreement  is  terminated,  except for a  termination  in
accordance with Section  9.1(a)(i),  or if any Party  repudiates this Agreement,
then  any  Party  may  reinitiate  the  proceedings  described  in the  "Mexican
Litigation List."

     (f) Except for the Authority Litigation, the Parties agree to suspend after
admission  and  before  service  any  lawsuit  filed by such  Party  before  the
execution  of  this  Agreement  and  not  yet  admitted  and/or  served  on  the
defendant(s)  so  long  as  such  suspension  does  not  imply  the  loss of any
proceeding  rights such as the filing of any  deadline  brief.  Upon  Closing or
termination of this Agreement as referred to in Section 7.15(b)(i),  the Parties
will  cause  their  litigation  counsel  to  request  that such  proceedings  be
terminated  in  accordance  with  Section  7.15(b)(i).  If for any  reason  this
Agreement is terminated  otherwise than in accordance with Section 7.15(b)(i) or
if any Party  repudiates  this  Agreement,  then any Party  may  reinitiate  the
proceeding so admitted and suspended and not yet served.

     (g)  Since  the  "Amparo"  proceedings  in the UMS are  not  subject  to be
suspended by agreement of the Parties, the Parties acknowledge the right of each
Party to file any  briefs  or legal  resources,  such as QUEJA,  RECLAMACIUN  or
REVISIUN in order to preserve their rights against any Amparo  resolution or any
decree or  resolution  entered  into in any  Amparo  proceeding  related  to the
proceedings  described  in  the  "Mexican  Litigation  List,"  and  the  Parties
acknowledge  the right of the Party to file a new  Amparo  complaint  only:  (i)
against resolutions adopted before the Parties filed the suspension briefs after
the execution of this Agreement, and (ii) against those resolutions entered into
after the execution of this  Agreement so long as: (x) they are the  consequence
of the accomplishment of an Amparo  resolution,  or (y) they are entered into in
any appeal related to any proceeding listed in the "Mexican Litigation List."

     (h) At the time of the execution of this Agreement,  KCS and TMM shall take
all action necessary to cause GTFM, TFM and the other GTFM Subsidiaries to adopt
the Release  Resolutions and will not subsequently  take, or permit to be taken,
any action to amend,  repeal,  revoke, or otherwise change, in whole or in part,
such Release Resolutions.

     (i) With  respect to the  Authority  Litigation,  KCS will grant  releases,
which will be independent of the Releases  identified in Section  7.15(d) above,
to those persons identified in the Authority Litigation Agreement.

     SECTION 7.16 LEGAL REPRESENTATION  RELEASE. TMM shall deliver to KCS at the
Closing,  a full and complete release,  in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L
(the  "Legal  Representation  Release"),  of  GTFM,  TFM  and  their  respective
Subsidiaries  of any and all  claims for fees or  expenses  of De Teresa and its
Affiliates other than with respect to the Ongoing Litigation Matters.

in accordance with the indemnification  provisions set forth in this Article 10,
and subject to the  limitations  and  exclusions  set forth in this  Article 10,
PROVIDED  however,  that such exclusive  remedies for monetary damages shall not
preclude  any  Party  from  pursuing  the  remedies  of  specific   performance,
injunctive  relief,  declaratory  judgment or any other  non-monetary  equitable
remedies available to such Party under Applicable Law.

     (c)  All  Losses  (as   defined   below)  for  which  any  Party  may  seek

of  their  respective  officers,  directors,  alternate  directors,   employees,
members,  stockholders,  agents and representatives ("KCS Indemnitees") harmless
from and against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, demands, obligations,

<PAGE>

therewith)  ("Losses")  resulting  from,  arising out of, or due to, directly or
indirectly, any of the following:

          (i)  Any  inaccuracy  or  misrepresentation  in,  or  breach  of,  any
     representation or warranty of Sellers contained in Article 5 (excluding, to
     avoid  duplication,  those which are the subject of  indemnification  under
     Section  10.5),  in any schedule or exhibit  delivered  hereunder by any of
     Sellers or in any certificates delivered by any of Sellers pursuant to this
     Agreement,  or any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of
     any of Sellers  contained  in this  Agreement,  in any  schedule or exhibit
     delivered  hereunder by any of Sellers or in any certificates  delivered by
     any of  Sellers  pursuant  to this  Agreement,  or any  claims,  causes  of
     actions,  rights  asserted or demands made by any third parties  (including
     any  Governmental  Authority)  arising  from  or  relating  to  any  of the
     foregoing;

          (ii) Any action (other than any actions  relating to the  arrangements
     with  DeTeresa  or which are the  subject  of the  Management  Claims,  the
     Acquisition  Claims or the Authority  Litigation) by or at the direction of
     any Person  released  pursuant to Section 7.15 hereof  (except for Larry M.
     Lawrence and the officers and directors of KCS) or the Authority Litigation
     Agreement,  or any  Designated  Person  that (x)  constituted  a fraud or a
     criminal  act  equivalent  to a felony  under the Laws of the  jurisdiction
     where the act occurred  (including  the burden of proof required under such
     Laws) or (y) occurred  during the period from April 20, 2003 to the date of
     this  Agreement  and  required  the  approval of KCS under the terms of the
     Original  Acquisition  Agreement,  which  approval  was  not  obtained  and
     resulted in Losses to GTFM or any GTFM  Subsidiary in excess of $1 million.
     The term "Designated Person" means any person identified on Exhibit P.

          (iii) Penalties and other termination  payments  aggregating more than
     $1 million  (including  any punitive,  special,  exemplary or other similar
     damages not incurred as a result of a wrongful  act by KCS)  required to be
     paid by the GTFM Group to terminate  any Contract (x) which was required to
     be,  but was  not,  identified  in  Section  5.7 of the  Seller  Disclosure
     Schedule and (y) which is actually  terminated  prior to the eighteen  (18)
     month  anniversary  of the Closing Date;  PROVIDED,  that prior to any such
     termination,  KCS  shall  give  notice  to the  Sellers  of its  desire  to
     terminate  the  Contract  and the  Sellers  shall  have the  right at their
     expense to  negotiate  with the other  parties to such  Contract  as to the
     termination of any such Contract, but the exercise of such right by Sellers
     shall not prejudice or prevent the exercise by KCS of its rights under this
     subsection (iii);

          (iv) Claims against TMM or any of its Affiliates for any breach in the
     performance  during the two year period  following  the Closing Date of any

<PAGE>

     obligation of TMM or any of its Affiliates  under any Continuing  Affiliate
     Agreement; and

          (v)  Any  litigation,   arbitration,   mediation  or  other  adversary
     proceeding  brought  against any KCS  Indemnitee by De Teresa or any of its
     Affiliates,  other  than  for  fees or  expenses  incurred  in the  Ongoing
     Litigation Matters which do not exceed the amounts  contemplated in Section
     5.7(d).

     (b) Sellers'  indemnification  obligations under Section 10.2(a)(i) for any
inaccuracy or misrepresentation  in, or breach of any representation or warranty
regarding  GTFM  or  its  Subsidiaries,   except  for  the  representations  and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.7, 5.11 and 5.21,  shall be limited to 51% of
Losses  and  then  only to the  extent  such 51% of  Losses  amount  to,  in the
aggregate,  $5 million or more; PROVIDED, that for the purpose of computing this
limitation on Sellers' indemnification obligations, (i) Losses shall be computed
without regard to whether such Losses resulted in a GTFM Material Adverse Effect
(i.e.,  if a  representation  or warranty is qualified by GTFM Material  Adverse
Effect or words of similar import and, giving effect to any such  qualification,
there has been a breach of such representation or warranty, then the computation
of Losses as a result of such  breach  shall take  effect of the full  amount of
such Losses and not solely the amount that exceeded an amount that resulted in a
GTFM Material Adverse Effect), (ii) Losses shall exclude all Losses with respect
to any single  matter where the amount of the Losses  arising out of such matter
is less than  $50,000  (PROVIDED,  that in computing  such  amount,  all matters
arising  out of the same set of  facts  or  substantially  the same set of facts
shall  be  aggregated),  (iii) to the  extent  that the  calculation  of  Losses
depends,  in  whole  or in  part,  on any  matters  relating  to  the  financial
statements  of any  member of the GTFM  Group,  such  calculation  shall be made
exclusively  by  reference  to IFRS  and to  financial  statements  prepared  in
accordance  with IFRS, and (iv) Losses which could be subject to the limitations
of this subsection (b) but which also constitute  Losses that are not subject to
such  limitations,  shall be  deemed  not  subject  to the  limitations  in this
subsection (b).

     (c) Any claim against  Sellers for  indemnification  for Losses (except for
those relating to Taxes,  or the matters  referred to in Sections  10.2(a)(iii),
(iv) and (v) and any  Losses  arising  out of or  resulting  from any  action or
omission on the part of any Seller or its Affiliate that involved a crime, fraud
or willful  misconduct,) shall be satisfied  exclusively out of, and the maximum
aggregate  liability of all the Sellers for such Losses shall be limited to, the
assets held in the Indemnity  Escrow;  provided,  at KCS's  election,  any claim
against  Sellers for  indemnification  for Losses may be  satisfied  from assets
remaining in the Indemnity  Escrow.  Any claim for  indemnification  against the
assets in the Indemnity Escrow, unless such claim is not contested by TMM, shall
be made by KCS by instituting  arbitration  proceedings  in accordance  with the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 12.11; PROVIDED, no more than
two (2) such  arbitration  proceedings  may be  instituted  and no such claim or
arbitration proceeding may be instituted later than April 1, 2007.

<PAGE>

     (d)  Any  claim  for  indemnification  pursuant  to  Article  10  by a  KCS
Indemnitee  other than KCS shall be brought  only by and  through  KCS,  and not
directly by such other KCS Indemnitee.

     SECTION 10.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY KCS.

     (a)  Subject to the  limitations  contained  in this  Article 10, KCS shall
indemnify  and hold harmless  Sellers,  each of their  Subsidiaries  and each of
their respective officers, directors,  alternate directors,  employees, members,
stockholders, agents and representatives ("Seller Indemnitees") from and against
all Losses  resulting  from,  arising out of, or due to, directly or indirectly,
any  inaccuracy or  misrepresentation  in, or breach of, any  representation  or
warranty of KCS  contained  in Article 6, in any  schedule or exhibit  delivered
hereunder  by KCS or in any  certificates  delivered  by KCS  pursuant  to  this
Agreement,  or any breach or  nonfulfillment of any covenant of KCS contained in
this Agreement,  in any schedule or exhibit delivered hereunder by KCS or in any
certificates delivered by KCS pursuant to this Agreement,  or any claims, causes
of actions,  rights asserted or demands made by any third parties (including any
Governmental Authority) arising from or relating to any of the foregoing.

     (b)  KCS's  indemnification  obligations  under  this  Article  10 shall be
limited  to Losses  which  amount  to, in the  aggregate,  $10  million or more,
provided   that  for  the  purpose  of  computing   this   limitation  or  KCS's
indemnification  obligations,  Losses  shall be  calculated  without  regard  to
whether  such  Losses  involved  a  KCS  Material  Adverse  Effect  (i.e.,  if a
representation  or warranty is qualified by KCS Material Adverse Effect or words
of similar import and, giving effect to any such qualification, there has been a
breach of such  representation or warranty,  then the computation of Losses as a
result of such  breach  shall take  effect of the full amount of such Losses and
not solely the amount that  exceeded an amount that  resulted in a KCS  Material
Adverse Effect).  The limitation set forth in the first sentence of this Section
10.3(b) shall not be applicable to any Losses  arising out of or resulting  from
any  action or  omission  on the part of KCS or its  Affiliate  that  involved a
crime,  fraud or willful  misconduct.  Losses shall also exclude all Losses with
respect to any single matter where the amount of the Losses  arising out of such
matter are less than  $50,000  (provided,  that in computing  such  amount,  all
matters  arising out of the same set of facts or  substantially  the same set of
facts shall be aggregated).

     (c) Any claim for  indemnification  pursuant to this Article 10 by a Seller
Indemnitee  other  than TMM shall be  brought  only by and  through  TMM and not
directly by such other Seller Indemnitee.

     SECTION 10.4 PROCEDURES FOR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.

     (a) In order for a Person (the  "Indemnified  Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification  provided for under Section 10.2 or 10.3 in respect of,  arising
out of or involving a claim made by any Person  (other than another Party or its
Affiliate)  against  the  Indemnified  Party  (a  "Third-Party   Claim"),   such
Indemnified  Party  must  notify  the  indemnifying  party  in  writing  of  the
Third-Party  Claim promptly (but in any event not later than the second Business
Day in the case

<PAGE>

of any litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceedings) following receipt
by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third-Party Claim;  PROVIDED,
however,   that  failure  to  give  such  notification   shall  not  affect  the
indemnification  provided  hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been actually  materially  prejudiced  (including with respect to the
defense of such Third Party-Claim) as a result of such failure.  Thereafter, the
Indemnified  Party  shall  deliver to the  indemnifying  party,  as  promptly as
practicable  following the Indemnified  Party's receipt  thereof,  copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating  to the  Third-Party  Claim that are not  separately  addressed  to the
indemnifying party.

     (b) If a  Third-Party  Claim is made  against  an  Indemnified  Party,  the
indemnifying  party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it so chooses,  to assume the defense  thereof with  counsel  selected by the
indemnifying  party;  provided,  however,  that such  counsel is not  reasonably
objected to by the Indemnified Party.  Should the indemnifying party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third-Party  Claim, the indemnifying  party shall not be
liable to the Indemnified  Party for any reasonable legal expenses  subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
indemnifying  party assumes such defense,  the Indemnified  Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense  thereof and to employ  counsel,  at its own
expense,  separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood  that the  indemnifying  party shall control such defense;  PROVIDED,
however, that the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses
of such  separate  counsel (i) if the  Parties to any such action or  proceeding
(including  impleaded  parties) include other Parties and representation of both
Parties would, in the reasonable  opinion of counsel for the Indemnified  Party,
be  inappropriate  due to a conflict of  interest,  or (ii) if the  indemnifying
party shall not have  employed  counsel  (other than counsel that is  reasonably
objected  to by the  Indemnified  Party)  within a  reasonable  time  after  the
Indemnified  Party has given notice of the institution of a Third-Party Claim in
compliance with Section 10.4(a).  The indemnifying party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel  employed by the  Indemnified  Party for
any period  during  which the  indemnifying  party has not  assumed  the defense
thereof,  PROVIDED,  however, that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by
the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute
a Third-Party Claim, all the Indemnified  Parties shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution  thereof at the indemnifying  party's  expense.  Such cooperation
shall  include the  retention and (upon the  indemnifying  party's  request) the
provision  to the  indemnifying  party  of  records  and  information  that  are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided  hereunder.  If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle,  compromise or discharge,  such Third-Party Claim without
the  indemnifying  party's prior  written  consent  (which  consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Third-Party  Claim,  the  Indemnified  Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of a Third-Party  Claim that the indemnifying  party may
recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full
amount of the  liability  in  connection  with  such  Third-Party  Claim,  which

<PAGE>

releases the Indemnified  Party  completely in connection with such  Third-Party
Claim and that would not otherwise  materially  adversely affect the Indemnified
Party.

     SECTION 10.5 TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

     (a) Sellers shall,  jointly and  severally,  indemnify and hold each of the
KCS  Indemnitees  harmless  from and  against  51% of all Taxes  and  associated
penalties,  interest  and  similar  charges  of GTFM and the  GTFM  Subsidiaries
relating  to  periods  ending  prior to the  Closing  Date and that  part of any
Straddle  Period  ending on the  Closing  Date and which  exceed the amounts set
forth on the Tax Returns and reports  filed by GTFM or its  Affiliates  for such
periods which GTFM or any GTFM Subsidiary  becomes  obligated to pay pursuant to
this Section 10.5.

     (b) Sellers' indemnification  obligations under this Section 10.5 shall not
be  limited  to the  assets  held in the  Indemnity  Escrow  or the VAT  Escrow;
PROVIDED,  however,  that at the election of KCS, to the extent assets remain in
the Indemnity Escrow or the VAT Escrow, Sellers' indemnification obligations may
be satisfied therefrom.

     (c) None of the KCS Indemnitees,  GTFM or any GTFM Subsidiaries  shall make
any payment to any of the  Sellers or any other  Person or Persons on account of
any  adjustment  to any Tax  item of GTFM or the GTFM  Subsidiaries  for any Tax
period ending prior to the Closing  Date, or any portion of any Straddle  Period
ending on the  Closing  Date,  regardless  of whether  any such  payments  would
otherwise be payable  pursuant to any agreement  among any of the Sellers,  GTFM
and the GTFM  Subsidiaries  or any other  Person or Persons,  or pursuant to any
provision of Applicable Law relating to Tax consolidation or otherwise.

     (d) KCS shall  indemnify  and hold  Sellers  harmless  from and against all
Taxes of GTFM and the GTFM  Subsidiaries for periods beginning after the Closing
Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, as
to which  Sellers have no  indemnification  obligations  to the KCS  Indemnitees
under this Section 10.5.

     (e)  (i) In the event that any Mexican  governmental taxing authority shall
     assert  that  Taxes  are due (a "Tax  Assessment")  from  GTFM or any  GTFM
     Subsidiary  (the "GTFM  Taxpayer")  with  respect to any period  covered by
     Sellers'  indemnification  obligations  under this Section 10.5, GTFM shall
     give written notice thereof to TMM and shall consult with an advisor chosen
     by GTFM which is knowledgeable about Tax Laws of the UMS.

          (ii)  Following such  consultation,  GTFM shall give written notice to
     TMM of  GTFM's  determination,  including  the  reasons  therefor,  to pay,
     contest,  or pay and contest the Tax  Assessment.  If the Tax Assessment is
     $10,000 or more, the procedure set forth below in clauses (iii) through (v)
     of this Section 10.5(e) shall be followed. For Tax Assessments of less than
     $10,000, TMM shall be bound by GTFM's determination, without resort to that
     procedure or to arbitration pursuant to Section 12.11.

          (iii) If TMM  disagrees  with GTFM's  determination,  TMM shall advise
     GTFM in writing within ten (10) days after the notice from GTFM.  Following
     receipt of a notice of disagreement

<PAGE>

     from TMM, GTFM shall promptly  consult with one of the advisors  identified
     in Exhibit O (a "Selected Tax Advisor") as to whether GTFM's  determination
     is reasonable  from the  perspective of the GTFM Taxpayer.  If the Selected
     Tax Advisor agrees that GTFM's  determination  was reasonable,  then Seller
     shall have an  indemnification  obligation  pursuant  to Section  10.5 with
     respect to such  matter and shall pay (or  advance,  in the case of payment
     and contest) 51% of the Tax Assessment upon demand from KCS.

          (iv) If the Selected Tax Advisor disagrees with GTFM's  determination,
     GTFM may consult another  Selected Tax Advisor.  If the second Selected Tax
     Advisor  agrees with GTFM's  determination,  then Sellers'  indemnification
     obligations  shall be as set forth above in subsection (iii). If the second
     Selected Tax Advisor  disagrees  with GTFM,  then Sellers'  indemnification
     obligations pursuant to this Section 10.5 with respect to such matter shall
     arise only when the Tax  Assessment  is finally  judicially  affirmed  by a
     final judgment  resolving the complaint (QUEJA) of a constitutional  appeal
     (aMPARO)  (a "Final  Tax  Resolution")  If the Tax  Assessment  is  finally
     judicially  rejected by a Final Tax Resolution,  then any amount of the Tax
     Assessment  paid or  advanced  by TMM  shall be  returned  to TMM  promptly
     following receipt thereof by GTFM from the Taxing Authority.

          (v) The  procedure  set  forth in this  Section  10.5(e)  shall be the
     exclusive  procedure  followed by the Parties  for  resolution  of disputes
     among the Parties  regarding Tax  Assessments,  and shall be in lieu of the
     dispute resolution  procedure set forth in Section 12.11. The Parties shall
     bear their own expenses  incurred under this Section  10.5(e),  except that
     the fees and expenses of the Selected Tax Advisors shall be borne by GTFM.

     or if the first two  Arbitrators  cannot  agree on the  appointment  of the
     third Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days of their confirmation by the
     American Arbitration  Association,  then such

<PAGE>

     Arbitrator  shall be appointed by the American  Arbitration  Association in
     accordance  with  its  Commercial   Arbitration   Rules.  As  soon  as  the
     arbitration  tribunal has been convened, a hearing date shall be set within
     fifteen (15) days thereafter; PROVIDED, that the Arbitrators may extend the
     date of the  hearing  upon  request  of any  Dispute  Party  to the  extent
     necessary to insure that such Dispute Party is given a reasonable period of
     time to prepare for the hearing. Written submittals in the English language
     shall be presented and exchanged by both Dispute  Parties five (5) Business
     Days before the hearing date.  At such time the Dispute  Parties shall also
     exchange  copies of all  documentary  evidence upon which they will rely at
     the  arbitration  hearing and a list of the  witnesses  whom they intend to
     call  to  testify  at  the  hearing.   The  Arbitrators  shall  make  their
     determination as promptly as practicable after conclusion of the hearing.

          (ii)  The  arbitration  shall be  conducted  in the  English  language
     pursuant to the Commercial  Arbitration  Rules of the American  Arbitration
     Association.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  (A) each Dispute Party shall
     have the right to audit the books and  records of the other  Dispute  Party
     that are  reasonably  related to the Dispute;  (B) each Dispute Party shall
     provide to the other,  reasonably in advance of any hearing,  copies of all
     documents which a Dispute Party intends to present in such hearing; (C) all
     hearings  shall  be  conducted  on  an  expedited  schedule;  and  (D)  all
     proceedings shall be confidential,  except that either Dispute Party may at
     its expense make a stenographic record thereof.

          (iii) The  Arbitrators  shall  endeavor to complete  all  hearings not
     later than one  hundred  twenty  (120) days after their  tribunal  has been
     convened,  and  shall  make  a  final  award  as  promptly  as  practicable
     thereafter.   Such  award  shall  be  communicated,   in  writing,  by  the
     Arbitrators to the Dispute Parties,  and shall contain specific findings of
     fact and  conclusions of law in accordance with the governing law set forth
     in Section 12.11(b) of this Agreement.  Any award of such Arbitrators shall
     be final and binding  upon the Parties to this  Agreement  and shall not be
     attacked  by any of the Parties to this  Agreement  in any court of law and
     may be enforced in any court having  jurisdiction,  including expressly the
     courts of the State of New York,  United States of America,  and the courts
     of the Federal District of Mexico. Any such award shall include appropriate
     instructions  to the Escrow Agent under the Closing Escrow  Agreement.  The
     Arbitrators  shall  apportion  all costs and  expenses of the  arbitration,
     including the Arbitrators' fees and expenses,  fees and expenses of experts
     and fees and  expenses of  translators  ("Arbitration  Costs")  between the
     prevailing and  non-prevailing  Dispute Party as the Arbitrators shall deem
     fair and reasonable. In circumstances where (A) a Dispute has been asserted
     or  defended  against  on  grounds  that the  Arbitrators  deem  manifestly
     unreasonable,   or  (B)  the  non-prevailing  Dispute  Party  has  rejected
     participation  in procedures  under Section  12.11(c),  the Arbitrators may
     assess all Arbitration Costs against the  non-prevailing  Dispute Party and
     may include in the award the prevailing Dispute Party's attorney's fees and
     expenses in  connection  with any and all  proceedings  under this  Section
     12.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the Arbitrators award
     multiple or punitive damages.

     (e)  Pursuant  to  an  agreement  of  the  Parties  hereto  or  a  judicial
determination that a Dispute is not subject to final and binding  arbitration as
set forth in Section 12.11, KCS and each of Sellers  irrevocably agrees that any
legal action or  proceeding  against it with respect to

<PAGE>

this  Agreement and any  transaction  contemplated  by this  Agreement  shall be
brought only in the courts of the State of New York, or of Federal courts of the
United States of America  sitting in New York,  and by execution and delivery of
this  Agreement,  KCS and each of Sellers  irrevocably  submits to the venue and
jurisdiction of each such court and irrevocably  waives any objection or defense
such Party may have to venue or personal  jurisdiction in any such court for the
purpose of  resolving  any claim,  dispute,  cause of action  arising  out of or
related to this Agreement  (including any claim that the suit or action has been
brought in an  inconvenient  forum and any right to which it may become entitled
on  account of place of  residence  or  domicile),  the  alleged  breach of this
Agreement, the enforcement of the terms of this Agreement, the Acquisition,  the
Ancillary  Agreements  and the other terms  contemplated  hereby and thereby.  A
final judgment in any suit,  action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any court where jurisdiction over the Parties may be had or in which
the Parties are subject to service of process.

     (f) Each of the Parties  irrevocably  appoints CT Corporation (the "Process
Agent"),  at 111  Eighth  Avenue,  New  York,  New  York  10011  (212-894-8940),
respectively,  as its agent and true and  lawful  attorney-in-fact  in its name,
place and stead to accept on behalf of each of the Parties and their  respective
properties and revenues,  service of copies of the summons and complaint and any
other process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding brought
in the State of New York,  and each of the Parties hereto agrees that failure of
the  Process  Agent to give any notice of any such  service of process to any of
the Parties  hereto  shall not impair or affect the  validity of such service or
the enforcement of any judgment based thereon.

     SECTION  12.12  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  KCS and TMM shall  consult  with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment on and
concur with,  any press release or other public  statement  with respect to this
Agreement, the Acquisition,  the Ancillary Agreements and the other transactions
contemplated  hereby  and  thereby,  except as either  Party  may  determine  is
otherwise  required by Applicable Law, judicial or administrative  action or any
requirement of the NYSE or any other applicable self-regulatory organization.

     SECTION 12.13  TERMINATION FEE. In the event of (i) a termination  pursuant
to  Section  9.1(a)(v),  the Party  experiencing  the  Change of  Control  shall
promptly after a demand  therefor remit to the Party  terminating in immediately
available funds the sum of Eighteen  Million Dollars  ($18,000,000),  and (ii) a
termination  pursuant to Section  9.1(a)(iii)  or  9.1(a)(iv) as a result of the
failure of the stockholders of KCS or of TMM to approve the Acquisition if at or
prior to the meeting of such stockholders to approve the Acquisition,  the Board
of Directors of KCS, in the case of the KCS stockholders'  meeting, or the Board
of Directors of TMM, in the case of the TMM  stockholders'  meeting,  shall have
failed  to  recommend  or  shall  have   withdrawn   and  not   reinstated   its
recommendation of, the Acquisition,  then the Party whose stockholders shall not
have approved the Acquisition shall remit to the other Party, if the other Party
elects  to  terminate  and  promptly  after a demand  therefor,  in  immediately
available funds, the sum of Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000).  The receipt
of any sums  pursuant to this  Section  12.13 shall not preclude or diminish any
other rights a Party may have under this Agreement.

     permit the  termination  of, or require  any notice  under,  or require the
     consent of any other party to, or result in the acceleration of, or entitle

     or otherwise)  any  obligation  or agreement,  or result in the loss of any
     benefit  or the  imposition  of any fee or  penalty,  or  give  rise to the
     creation of any lien or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of
     KCS,  under any of the terms,  conditions or provisions of any debt,  note,
     bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, permit, agreement
     or other  instrument  or obligation to which KCS is a party or by which KCS
     or any of its respective  properties or assets may be bound or affected, or
     (iii) violate any Rules  (including  foreign,  federal and state securities

     performance of this  Stockholders'  Agreement and the  consummation by such

     Stockholders' Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by

     operations; and

          (c)  Except  for  shares  of Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant  to the

     2.1  STANDSTILL  PROVISIONS.  (a) TMM,  TMMH,  MM and each of the Principal
Stockholders  covenants to and agrees with KCS that,  unless it is  specifically
invited  in writing to do so by the Board of  Directors,  during the  Standstill
Period  such  Person  will not,  and will cause each of its  Affiliates  not to,
directly or indirectly, alone, as part of a Group or in concert with others:

               (i)  acquire  or agree to acquire  (other  than  pursuant  to the
          Acquisition  Agreement,  the Consulting Agreement,  or this Agreement)
          beneficial  ownership  of any  Voting  Securities  (or any  direct  or
          indirect  rights or options to acquire  (through  purchase,  exchange,
          conversion   or   otherwise)   beneficial   ownership  of  any  Voting
          Securities),  if  after  any such  acquisition,  such  Person  and its
          Affiliates, or such Group would beneficially own aggregate outstanding
          Voting  Securities  representing  more  than 20% of the  Total  Voting
          Power;

               (ii) make any public announcement with respect to any acquisition
          or proposal by any TMM Holder, or any Group of which any TMM Holder is
          a member or acting in  concert  with,  for the  acquisition  of Voting
          Securities  with  respect to any  merger,  consolidation  or  business
          combination  involving KCS or its Affiliates or for or with respect to
          any purchase of a substantial portion of the

<PAGE>

          assets of KCS or its  Affiliates,  whether or not such proposal  might
          require the making of a public announcement by KCS;

               (iii) solicit,  initiate, make, or in any way participate in, any
          "solicitation"  of "proxies" to vote any Voting Securities or become a
          "participant" in any "election  contest" (as such terms are defined or
          used in Regulation  14A under the Exchange Act, as such  Regulation is
          currently in effect,  disregarding clause (iv) of Rule 14a-1(1)(2) and
          including any exempt solicitation pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(1));

               (iv) except as approved by the Board of Directors,  call, or vote
          in favor of a call for, any special meeting of stockholders of KCS;

               (v)  initiate or propose any matter for  submission  to a vote of
          stockholders  of KCS or  participate  in the  making  of,  or  solicit
          stockholders for the approval of, any stockholder proposal;

               (vi) grant any proxy with respect to any Voting Securities to any
          Person not approved in writing by KCS,  except for proxies  granted to
          representatives  of KCS in connection  with the voting of shares at an
          annual or special meeting of stockholders or to a pledgee  pursuant to
          a pledge that complies with Section 3.6 of this Agreement;

               (vii) take any action which would be reasonably likely to require
          KCS to  make  a  public  announcement  regarding  any  of the  matters
          specified in this Section 2.1(a)(i)-(xi); or

               (viii)   initiate  or   participate   in  any   negotiations   or
          arrangements  with  any  third  party  with  respect  to  any  of  the
          foregoing,  or provide any  information or take any action designed to
          advise,  assist,  encourage  or act in concert with any third party in
          connection with any of the foregoing;

               (ix)  disclose  publicly  any  intention,   plan  or  arrangement
          inconsistent with the foregoing;

               (x) make any  request in a public  manner or that  would  require
          public  disclosure,  that  KCS  (or  any of its  officers,  directors,
          representatives, employees, attorneys, advisors, agents or Affiliates)
          to waive, amend or modify any provisions of Section 2.1(a)(i)-(xi); or

               (xi) otherwise  act, alone or in concert with others,  to seek to
          control or influence materially the management,  Board of Directors or
          policies of KCS.

          (b) TMM, TMMH, MM and each of the Principal  Stockholders covenants to
     and agrees  with KCS that such  Person  will  promptly  notify the Board of
     Directors of any serious  inquiry from any third party regarding any of the
     matters specified in Section

<PAGE>

     2.1(a)(i)-(xi)  (which notification shall include the identity of each such
     third party and the material  terms and  conditions of each such  inquiry).
     The Parties  acknowledge  that any such inquiry  made by a Competitor  or a
     representative of a Competitor shall be regarded as a serious inquiry.

     2.2 EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS.  If TMM, TMMH, MM, the Principal  Stockholders or
any of their respective  Affiliates owns or acquires beneficial ownership of any
Voting Securities of KCS in violation of Section  2.1(a)(i),  none of TMM, TMMH,
MM, the Principal Stockholders, nor any of their Affiliates shall be entitled to
vote,  or cause to be voted,  any Voting  Securities in excess of the greater of
(i) the level owned  immediately  prior to the acquisition of Voting  Securities
that  resulted  in the  violation  and (ii) the level  permitted  to be owned by
Section 2.1(a)(i), for any purposes (including, without limitation, with respect
to a  transaction  of any type or for the  election of  directors)  and shall be
deemed  thereby  to have  granted  to any  Person  designated  by the  Board  of
Directors an  irrevocable  proxy to vote such  securities  in  proportion to the
votes cast by all other  holders  of Voting  Securities  of KCS on such  matter;
PROVIDED,  that the right to vote such securities shall be reinstated,  and such
proxy  shall be deemed to be revoked,  upon the  earlier of (i) any  transfer of
such  securities  other than to an Affiliate of the  transferor  and that is not
otherwise in violation of this  Stockholders'  Agreement and (ii) the first date
on which the beneficial ownership of Voting Securities is reduced to the greater
of (x) the level owned immediately prior to the acquisition of Voting Securities
that resulted in the violation and (y) the level permitted by Section 2.1(a)(i).
KCS shall (as specified in Section 9.11) be entitled to enforce specifically the
terms of this  Section  2.2 and may also  pursue any other  available  remedy to
which it may be  entitled  as a result of any  violation  of this  Stockholders'
Agreement.

     2.3  TERMINATION.  The rights and  obligations  under this Article II shall
immediately and irrevocably terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) a Change
of Control of KCS,  or (ii) the first date the TMM Holders  beneficially  own in
the aggregate less than 15% of the outstanding  Voting  Securities of KCS for at
least 30 consecutive days.

     2.4 SECTION 203,  DELAWARE  GENERAL  CORPORATION  LAW. The  acquisition  of
Voting  Securities of KCS by any of the TMM Holders  pursuant to this Agreement,
the  Acquisition  Agreement or the Consulting  Agreement shall not be subject to
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Section 203"), but Section
203 shall remain  applicable to any other  acquisitions of Voting  Securities by
any of the TMM Holders.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                            RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER

     3.1 GENERAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS.  The TMM Holders shall not, directly
or indirectly,  alone or in concert with others, sell, assign, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate,  otherwise subject to any lien, grant any option with respect to or
otherwise   dispose  of  any   interest  in  (or  enter  into  an  agreement  or
understanding with respect to the foregoing) any Voting Securities  beneficially
owned by them (a  "Disposition"),  except in  accordance  with the terms of this
Stockholders' Agreement.

<PAGE>

     3.2 DISPOSITIONS TO COMPETITORS.

          (a) For a period of seven  years  after the  Effective  Date,  the TMM
     Holders shall not, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others,
     effect a Disposition to a Competitor; provided that no Disposition pursuant
     to a Public  Offering or a Rule 144  Transaction  will be deemed to violate
     this  prohibition if the selling TMM Holder(s) invoke and follow or require
     participating underwriters or brokers to invoke and follow, appropriate and
     reasonable  procedures  (subject to the prior  approval of KCS, which shall
     not be unreasonably  withheld)  designed to prevent the sale of such Voting
     Securities   to  any   Competitor.   The  Parties   agree  that  a  written
     representation  from the  purchaser or a  representative  of the  purchaser
     shall satisfy the requirements of appropriate and reasonable procedures set
     forth  in this  Section  3.2(a)  provided  such  representation  authorizes
     reliance  thereon by KCS and KCS has no reasonable  grounds to believe that
     such representation cannot be relied upon to satisfy such requirements.

          (b) After the  earliest of (i) seven  years  following  the  Effective
     Date,  or (ii) the first date on which the TMM  Holders  have  beneficially
     owned in the  aggregate,  directly or indirectly  and alone or as part of a
     Group,  less than 15% of the  outstanding  Voting  Securities of KCS for at
     least 30  consecutive  days (such earlier time being  referred to herein as
     the "ROFR Commencement Date"), any TMM Holder may sell Voting Securities to
     a Competitor so long as the procedures set forth in this Section 3.2(b) are
     followed.  If after  the ROFR  Commencement  Date the  selling  TMM  Holder
     proposes to sell Voting Securities to a Competitor (it being agreed that no
     Disposition pursuant to a Public Offering or a Rule 144 Transaction will be
     deemed to give rise to this right of first refusal),  then KCS shall have a
     right of first refusal.  If such a Disposition to a Competitor is proposed,
     the selling TMM Holder shall  deliver a written  notice to KCS advising KCS
     of the number of Voting Securities such holder desires to sell and the bona
     fide terms,  including price, of any such proposed  transaction.  KCS shall
     have the right (but not the  obligation)  to purchase,  in whole but not in
     part,  such Voting  Securities at a per share cash purchase  price equal to
     the  cash  purchase  price,  or on such  other  terms as  provided,  in the
     agreement  between  the selling  TMM Holder and a  Competitor.  In order to
     exercise its purchase rights  hereunder,  KCS must deliver a written notice
     to the seller to such  effect  within 10  business  days  after  receipt of
     written  notice of the proposed  sale. If KCS timely elects to purchase the
     Voting  Securities  specified in the notice, it shall complete the purchase
     within 60 days from the  delivery of such  notice,  unless a longer time is
     required to secure any  regulatory  approvals,  in which case the  purchase
     shall  occur on the  second  business  day  after the  receipt  of any such
     required   approvals,   which  approvals  shall  be  obtained  as  soon  as
     practicable.  Unless KCS exercises its right of first refusal by delivering
     written  notice to the selling TMM Holder  prior to the  expiration  of the
     offering period  described  above, the selling TMM Holder shall be entitled
     to sell such Voting Securities which KCS has not elected to purchase during
     the 120 days  following  such  expiration  on terms and  conditions no more
     favorable to the  purchasers  thereof than those offered to KCS. Any Voting
     Securities not so sold by the selling TMM Holder during such 120 day period
     may not  thereafter  be sold unless  again  offered to KCS  pursuant to the
     terms of this provision. This purchase right shall be assignable, in whole

<PAGE>

     or in  part,  by KCS to any  other  Person,  but no such  assignment  shall
     relieve KCS of its  obligation to assure  payment of the purchase price for
     any Voting  Securities  as to which a notice of election  to  exercise  the
     right of first refusal is made by KCS or any such assignee.

     3.3  DISPOSITIONS  TO  AFFILIATES.  For a period of seven  years  after the
Effective Date, each of the TMM Holders shall not, directly or indirectly, alone
or in concert with others,  effect a  Disposition  of Voting  Securities  to any
Affiliate of TMM,  TMMH, or MM or any  Affiliate of any  Principal  Stockholders
unless  such  Affiliate  agrees  in  writing  to be bound  by the  terms of this
Stockholders'   Agreement  and  provided  that  the  TMM  Holders  shall  remain
responsible,  jointly and  severally,  for any  breaches  of this  Stockholders'
Agreement by such  Affiliate  (provided that any TMM Holder which is a Principal
Stockholder shall be severally  responsible only for breaches by an Affiliate of
the  Principal  Stockholder  to  which  such  Principal  Stockholder  effects  a
Disposition).

     3.4 DISPOSITIONS TO CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Subject to the provisions of Sections
3.2 and  3.3,  the TMM  Holders  may  make a  Disposition  of any or all  Voting
Securities beneficially owned by such Person, provided that:

          (a) No  Disposition  (whether  in a single  transaction  or  series of
     transactions)  that  in  the  aggregate   represents  5%  or  more  of  the
     outstanding  Voting  Securities  shall be made to any Person  (other than a
     Permitted  Underwriter or an Affiliate  pursuant to and in accordance  with
     Section 3.3) other than a Person who is eligible to file  reports  pursuant
     to Rule 13d-1 under the  Exchange Act (a "13G  Filer"),  unless such Person
     would not be so eligible  with  respect to the Voting  Securities  acquired
     from the Disposition; and

          (b) No  Disposition  (whether  in a single  transaction  or  series of
     transactions) of Voting  Securities that in the aggregate  represents 5% or
     more of the outstanding  Voting  Securities  shall be made to any 13G Filer
     unless:

               (i) such 13G Filer would  continue to be eligible to file reports
          pursuant to Section  13(g) under the  Exchange Act with respect to the
          Voting  Securities after giving effect to the proposed  acquisition of
          such Voting Securities; and

               (ii) the selling TMM Holder shall have delivered a written notice
          to KCS  advising  KCS of the  number of Voting  Securities  the seller
          desires  to sell  and the  terms,  including  price,  of the  proposed
          transaction  and  KCS  has  been  provided  the  right  (but  not  the
          obligation) to purchase,  in whole or in part, such Voting  Securities
          at a per share cash  purchase  price equal to the purchase  price,  or
          upon such other terms as  provided,  in the proposed  transaction.  In
          order to exercise its purchase  rights  hereunder,  KCS must deliver a
          written  notice to the seller to such effect within five business days
          after  receipt  of  written  notice  of the  proposed  sale.  Upon the
          expiration of the offering  period  described  above,  the selling TMM
          Holder shall be entitled to sell such Voting  Securities which KCS

<PAGE>

          has not  elected  to  purchase  during  the 120  days  following  such
          expiration on terms and conditions no more favorable to the purchasers
          thereof than those offered to KCS. Any Voting  Securities  not so sold
          by the  selling  TMM  Holder  during  such  120  day  period  may  not
          thereafter  be sold unless again  offered to KCS pursuant to the terms
          of this provision.  This purchase right shall be assignable,  in whole
          or in part, by KCS to any other Person,  but no such assignment  shall
          relieve KCS of its  obligation to assure payment of the purchase price
          for any Voting Securities as to which KCS has delivered such a written
          notice.

          (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section  3.4(a) and (b),  no
     Disposition  (whether in a single  transaction or a series of transactions)
     shall be made to any  Person  or  Group  that  would,  together  with  such
     Person's   Affiliates  and  Associates  and  after  giving  effect  to  the
     acquisition of such Voting  Securities,  beneficially own or have the right
     to acquire more than 15% of the Total Voting Power.

     3.5  DISPOSITIONS  OF HOLDERS OF VOTING  SECURITIES.  For a period of seven
years after the Effective  Date, no TMM Holder  shall,  directly or  indirectly,
alone or in concert with others, sell, assign,  transfer,  pledge,  hypothecate,
otherwise  subject to any lien,  grant any option with  respect to or  otherwise
dispose of any  interest in (or enter into an agreement  or  understanding  with
respect to the foregoing)  any capital stock or Voting  Securities or control of
any Person that, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns any Voting Securities
of KCS to a Competitor, except as permitted by Section 3.3.

     3.6 PLEDGES.  Subject to the provisions  contained herein, a TMM Holder may
pledge or hypothecate as security for any indebtedness or other  obligations any
or all Voting  Securities  beneficially  owned by such Person provided that such
TMM Holder obtains prior to such pledge or  hypothecation  written  consent from
the  pledgee  that upon the  occurrence  of an event which gives the pledgee the
right to foreclose on the pledged Voting Securities  ("Foreclosure  Event") such
pledgee shall provide to KCS prompt written notice of such Foreclosure Event and
provide KCS the right to  purchase  such Voting  Securities  at a cash  purchase
price equal to the average  closing  price of KCS's Common Stock on the New York
Stock  Exchange  over the five  consecutive  trading days  preceding the date of
receipt of the notice of the pending  foreclosure sale. In order to exercise its
purchase rights  hereunder,  KCS must deliver a written notice to the pledgee to
such effect within five  business  days after  receipt of written  notice of the
Foreclosure Event and complete such purchase within 60 days from the delivery of
such notice unless a longer time is required to secure any regulatory approvals,
in which case the  purchase  shall  occur on the second  business  day after the
receipt of any such required approvals. This purchase right shall be assignable,
in whole or in part, by KCS to any other Person,  but no such  assignment  shall
relieve KCS of its  obligation to assure  payment of the purchase  price for any
Voting Securities as to which KCS has delivered such a written notice.

     3.7  EFFECT OF  NON-COMPLIANCE.  Any  attempted  Disposition  of any Voting
Securities in violation of any provision of this  Stockholders'  Agreement shall
be void,  and KCS shall not record  such  Disposition  on its books or treat any
purported  transferee of such Voting  Securities

voting,  receiving dividends or other distributions and being entitled to any of
the benefits of this Stockholders' Agreement.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Article III, the TMM Holders  shall be
permitted to make a Disposition in connection  with any tender or exchange offer
made by an  unaffiliated  third party to acquire KCS Common Stock so long as the
following  conditions  are satisfied (i) the TMM Holders are in compliance  with
the provisions of Section 2.1(a) with respect to such tender or exchange  offer;
(ii) such tender or  exchange  offer must be for all of the  outstanding  Voting

     4.1 PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS.

          (a) Subject to Section  4.1(d)  below,  except for issuances of Common
     Stock (including for this purpose,  options,  warrants and other securities
     convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) issued:

               (i)  to  KCS's   employees,   directors,   consultants,   agents,
          independent  contractors or other service providers in connection with
          a Plan  existing on the date hereof or a Plan approved by the Board of
          Directors and adopted by KCS after the date hereof;

               (ii) upon the exercise of any options,  warrants,  convertible or
          exchangeable securities which are outstanding as of the date hereof;

<PAGE>

               (iii)  in   connection   with   the   acquisition   (by   merger,
          consolidation, acquisition of assets or equity interests or otherwise)
          of the equity interests or assets of another Person; or

               (iv) issued pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement,  the Ancillary
          Agreements, or the Consulting Agreement;

     if KCS authorizes the issuance or sale of any shares of Common Stock or any
     securities  containing  options or rights to  acquire  any shares of Common
     Stock (other than as a dividend on the outstanding Common Stock), KCS shall
     first notify TMM Holders of such proposed  transaction and offer to sell to
     each such  Person a number of shares of Common  Stock (or,  as  applicable,
     options,  warrants or other securities  convertible into or exercisable for
     Common Stock) equal to the product  obtained by  multiplying  the number of
     shares  of  Common  Stock or  securities  containing  options  or rights to
     acquire  Common Stock  authorized to be sold by KCS by a fraction,  (1) the
     numerator  of which is the number of shares of Common  Stock  owned by such
     Person   and  (2)  the   denominator   of  which   is  the   total  of  all
     then-outstanding  Voting  Securities.  Each TMM Holder shall be entitled to
     purchase such Common Stock (or, as applicable,  options,  warrants or other
     securities  convertible  into or exercisable  for Common Stock) at the same
     price and on the same terms and  conditions  as such  Common  Stock (or, as
     applicable,  options,  warrants  or other  securities  convertible  into or
     exercisable  for Common Stock) are to be offered to any other  Persons.  To
     the  extent  that  any  TMM  Holder  elects  not  to  participate  in  such
     pre-emptive  rights,  each of the other TMM  Holders  shall  have a prorata
     right to  purchase  at the same price and on the same terms and  conditions
     the Voting Securities which such non-participating TMM Holder had the right
     but elected not to purchase;  provided that the exercise of such right does
     not extend the time for  written  notice set forth in Section  4.1(b).  The
     purchase  price for all stock and  securities  offered to such TMM  Holders
     shall be payable in cash or, to the extent that other payment is to be made
     by the other  Persons to whom stock or securities  are so offered,  on such
     other payment terms.

          (b) In order to exercise its purchase rights  hereunder,  a TMM Holder
     must  deliver a written  notice to KCS to such effect  within ten  business
     days after  receipt of written  notice from KCS  describing  in  reasonable
     detail the stock or securities  being offered,  the purchase price thereof,
     the payment terms, such holder's  percentage  allotment,  and the number of
     shares of Common  Stock (or,  as  applicable,  options,  warrants  or other
     securities  convertible  into or exercisable  for Common Stock) such holder
     has the right to purchase hereunder.

          (c) Upon the expiration of the offering period  described  above,  KCS
     shall be entitled to sell such stock or  securities  which such TMM Holders
     have not elected to purchase  during the 120 days following such expiration
     on terms and conditions no more  favorable to the  purchasers  thereof than
     those offered to such TMM Holders.  Any stock or securities  not so sold by
     KCS during  such 120 day period may not  thereafter  be sold  unless  again
     offered to the TMM Holders pursuant to the terms of this Article IV.

<PAGE>

          (d)  The  rights  of the TMM  Holders  under  this  Article  IV  shall

     the date hereof.

nominated by the  Nominating  Committee and elected to the Board of Directors by
the  holders  of  Common  Stock;  and each  such  holder  shall  take all  other
reasonably necessary or desirable actions within its control (including, without
limitation,  attendance  at  meetings  in  person or by proxy  for  purposes  of
obtaining a quorum and  execution  of written  consents in lieu of  meetings) to
cause such actions to be taken.

with any of the agreements,  covenants or conditions  contained herein, shall be
valid  only if set forth in an  instrument  in  writing  signed on behalf of the
Party  against  whom  the  waiver  is to be  effective.  No  such  waiver  shall
constitute  a waiver of, or estoppel  with respect to, any  subsequent  or other
inaccuracy,  breach or failure to strictly  comply with the  provisions  of this
Stockholders'  Agreement.  Any  delay or  omission  on the part of KCS or TMM to
exercise any right  hereunder shall not in any manner impair the exercise of any
right accruing to it hereafter.

     9.2 ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  This Agreement  constitutes the entire agreement of
the Parties,  except as provided herein, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings,  written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

     9.3  INTERPRETATION.   This  Stockholders'  Agreement  is  in  the  English
language.  The Parties  waive any rights they may have under  Applicable  Law to
have this  Stockholders'  Agreement  made in any  language  other than  English;
provided to the extent that any such waiver shall not be valid under  Applicable
Law, the Parties  agree that in case of any ambiguity or  contradiction  between
the English language version of this Stockholders' Agreement and any translation
into any other language, that the English language version shall control.

     9.4  SEVERABILITY.  Any term or provision of this  Stockholders'  Agreement
which  is  invalid  or  unenforceable  in any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to  that
jurisdiction,   be   ineffective   to  the   extent   of  such   invalidity   or
unenforceability  without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and  provisions  of this  Stockholders'  Agreement or affecting  the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Stockholders' Agreement
in any other jurisdiction.  If any provision of this Stockholders'  Agreement is
so broad as to be  unenforceable,  the provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

communications  hereunder  shall be in writing and shall be deemed  given if (a)

          CONDITIONS OF SUCH STOCKHOLDERS'  AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN COMPLIED WITH IN
          FULL AND NO PERSON  MAY  REQUEST  KCS TO RECORD  THE  TRANSFER  OF ANY
          SHARES  IF  SUCH  TRANSFER  IS  IN  VIOLATION  OF  SUCH  STOCKHOLDERS'

notation  on its  records  or  give  instructions  to  any  transfer  agents  or
registrars  for such shares in order to implement the  restrictions  on transfer

that all of the Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     9.11 SPECIFIC  ENFORCEMENT.  The Parties hereto  acknowledge and agree that

Parties  hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or  injunctions to prevent or

     9.12 GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

          (a)  Resolution of any and all disputes  between KCS, on the one hand,
     and one or more of TMM,  TMMH, MM, the Principal  Stockholders,  and any of
     their  respective  Affiliates  on the other hand,  (each of KCS, on the one
     hand,  and TMM,  TMMH,  MM,  the  Principal  Stockholders,  or any of their
     respective  Affiliates,  on the other hand, a "Dispute  Party" and, both of
     KCS, on the one hand, and TMM, TMMH, MM, the Principal Stockholders, or any
     of their respective  Affiliates,  on the other hand, the "Dispute Parties")
     arising  from or in  connection  with this  Stockholders'  Agreement or any
     transactions contemplated by this Stockholders' Agreement, whether based on
     contract,  tort,  common  law,  equity,  statute,   regulation,   order  or
     otherwise,  ("Disputes"),  including  Disputes  arising in connection  with
     claims by third Persons,  shall be  exclusively  governed by and settled in
     accordance  with the  provisions of this Section 9.12;  provided,  that the
     foregoing shall not preclude  equitable or other judicial relief to enforce
     the provisions  hereof or to preserve the status quo pending  resolution of
     Disputes hereunder.

          (b) THIS AGREEMENT, THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO AND
     THE  ADJUDICATION  AND  ENFORCEMENT  THEREOF,  SHALL  BE  GOVERNED  BY  AND
     INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE  SUBSTANTIVE  LAWS OF THE
     STATE OF  DELAWARE  AND THE FEDERAL  LAWS OF THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA,
     WITHOUT REGARD TO APPLICABLE CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS.

          (c) As to any Dispute which is not resolved in the ordinary  course of
     business, the Dispute Parties shall first attempt in good faith to promptly
     resolve  any  Dispute by  negotiations  between  executives.  Either of the
     Dispute  Parties may initiate this  procedure by delivery of written notice
     of the Dispute (the "Dispute  Notice") to the other. Not later than 20 days
     after delivery of the Dispute  Notice,  one executive of one of the Dispute
     Parties with  authority to settle the Dispute shall meet with one executive
     of the other  Dispute  Party  with  authority  to settle  the  Dispute at a
     reasonably  acceptable  time and place,  and thereafter as such  executives
     shall deem reasonably  necessary.  The executives  shall exchange  relevant
     information and endeavor to resolve the Dispute. Prior to any such meeting,
     each Dispute Party's executive shall advise the other as to any individuals
     who will attend such meeting with the executive.  All negotiations pursuant
     to this  Section  9.12(c)  shall be  confidential  and shall be  treated as
     compromise

<PAGE>

     negotiations  for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
     similarly under other local or foreign rules of evidence.

          (d) Each  Dispute  Party  hereby  agrees to submit  all  Disputes  not
     resolved   pursuant  to  Section   9.12(c)  hereof  to  final  and  binding
     arbitration in New York,  New York.  Either Dispute Party may initiate such
     arbitration by delivery of a demand therefor (the "Arbitration  Demand") to
     the other  Dispute Party not sooner than 60 days after the date of delivery
     of the Dispute Notice but promptly thereafter;  provided, that if a Dispute
     Party  rejects  participation  in the  procedures  provided  under  Section
     9.12(c),  the other Dispute Party may initiate  arbitration at such earlier
     time as such rejection  shall become  reasonably  apparent,  and,  whenever
     arbitration  is  initiated,  may seek  recovery  of any damages or expenses
     arising from such rejection,  including  attorney's fees and expenses,  and
     Arbitration  Costs  (as  defined  below)  in  connection  with  arbitration
     hereunder.

               (i) Three Arbitrators shall be appointed (the "Arbitrators"), one
          of whom shall be  appointed by KCS, one by TMM, and the third of whom,
          who shall  act as the  chairman  of the  arbitral  tribunal,  shall be
          appointed by the first two Arbitrators  within 10 business days of the
          first  two  Arbitrators   confirmation  by  the  American  Arbitration
          Association.   Each  Party  agrees  that  the  TMM  Holders  shall  be
          considered jointly as one side for the purposes of constitution of the
          arbitration  tribunal  hereunder.  If either  Dispute  Party  fails to
          appoint an Arbitrator  within 10 business days of a request in writing
          by the other  Dispute  Party to do so or if the first two  Arbitrators
          cannot  agree on the  appointment  of the third  Arbitrator  within 10
          business  days  of  their  confirmation  by the  American  Arbitration
          Association,  then such Arbitrator  shall be appointed by the American
          Arbitration  Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
          Rules.  As soon as the  arbitration  tribunal  has  been  convened,  a
          hearing date shall be set within 15 days  thereafter;  provided,  that
          the Arbitrators may extend the date of the hearing upon request of any
          Dispute  Party to the extent  necessary  to insure  that such  Dispute
          Party is given a reasonable period of time to prepare for the hearing.
          Written  submittals  in the English  language  shall be presented  and
          exchanged  by both  Dispute  Parties  five  business  days  before the
          hearing  date.  At such time the Dispute  Parties  shall also exchange
          copies of all  documentary  evidence  upon which they will rely at the
          arbitration  hearing and a list of the  witnesses  whom they intend to
          call to  testify  at the  hearing.  The  Arbitrators  shall make their
          determination  as  promptly as  practicable  after  conclusion  of the
          hearing.

               (ii) The arbitration  shall be conducted in the English  language
          pursuant  to  the  Commercial   Arbitration   Rules  of  the  American
          Arbitration  Association.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  (A)  each
          Dispute  Party  shall have the right to audit the books and records of
          the other  Dispute Party that are  reasonably  related to the Dispute;
          (B) each  Dispute  Party  shall  provide to the other,  reasonably  in
          advance of any hearing,  copies of all documents which a Dispute Party
          intends  to  present  in such  hearing;  (C)  all  hearings  shall  be
          conducted on an expedited  schedule;  and (D) all proceedings shall be
          confidential, except that either Dispute Party may at its expense make
          a stenographic record thereof.

               (iii) The Arbitrators shall endeavor to complete all hearings not
          later than 120 days after their tribunal has been convened,  and shall
          make a final award as promptly as

<PAGE>

          practicable thereafter. Such award shall be communicated,  in writing,
          by the Arbitrators to the Dispute Parties,  and shall contain specific
          findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of law in  accordance  with  the
          governing  law set forth in  Section  9.12(b) of this  Agreement.  Any
          award of such Arbitrators  shall be final and binding upon the Parties
          to this  Agreement  and shall not be attacked by any of the Parties to
          this  Agreement  in any court of law and may be  enforced in any court
          having  jurisdiction,  including  expressly the courts of the State of
          New York,  United  States of  America,  and the courts of the  Federal
          District of Mexico.  The  Arbitrators  shall  apportion  all costs and
          expenses  of the  arbitration,  including  the  Arbitrators'  fees and
          expenses,  fees and  expenses  of  experts  and fees and  expenses  of
          translators   ("Arbitration   Costs")   between  the   prevailing  and
          non-prevailing  Dispute Party as the  Arbitrators  shall deem fair and
          reasonable.  In circumstances where (A) a Dispute has been asserted or
          defended  against  on grounds  that the  Arbitrators  deem  manifestly
          unreasonable,  or (B) the  non-prevailing  Dispute  Party has rejected
          participation in procedures under Section 9.12(c), the Arbitrators may
          assess all Arbitration Costs against the non-prevailing  Dispute Party
          and may include in the award the prevailing Dispute Party's attorney's
          fees and expenses in  connection  with any and all  proceedings  under
          this Section 9.12.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the
          arbitrator award multiple or punitive damages.

          (e)  Pursuant  to an  agreement  of the  Parties  hereto or a judicial
     determination   that  a  Dispute  is  not  subject  to  final  and  binding
     arbitration  as set forth in Section  9.12(d),  KCS, TMM,  TMMH, MM and the
     Principal  Stockholders  each  irrevocably  agrees that any legal action or
     proceeding against it with respect to this Stockholders'  Agreement and any
     transaction  contemplated by this Stockholders'  Agreement shall be brought
     only in the courts of the State of New York,  or of  Federal  courts of the
     United States of America sitting in New York, and by execution and delivery
     of this Stockholders'  Agreement,  KCS and each of TMM Holders  irrevocably
     submits to the venue and  jurisdiction  of each such court and  irrevocably
     waives any  objection  or defense  such Party may have to venue or personal
     jurisdiction  in any such  court for the  purpose of  resolving  any claim,
     dispute,  cause of action  arising out of or related to this  Stockholders'
     Agreement  (including any claim that the suit or action has been brought in
     an  inconvenient  forum and any right to which it may  become  entitled  on
     account of place of  residence  or  domicile),  the alleged  breach of this
     Stockholders' Agreement, the enforcement of the terms of this Stockholders'
     Agreement,  the  Acquisition  Agreement,  the Ancillary  Agreements and the
     other terms contemplated  hereby and thereby. A final judgment in any suit,
     action or proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in any court
     where  jurisdiction over the Parties may be had or in which the Parties are
     subject to service of process.

          (f) Each of the Parties  hereto  irrevocably  appoints CT  Corporation
     (the "Process Agent"), at 1209 Orange Street,  Wilmington,  Delaware, 19801
     (telephone  302-658-7581) as its agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact
     in its name, place and stead to accept on behalf of each of the parties and
     their respective properties and revenues,  service of copies of the summons
     and  complaint  and any other process which may be served in any such suit,
     action or  proceeding  brought  in the  State of New York,  and each of the
     Parties  hereto agrees that failure of the Process Agent to give any notice
     of any such  service  of  process to any of the  Parties  hereto  shall not
     impair or affect the  validity of such  service or the  enforcement  of any
     judgment based thereon.

<PAGE>

     9.13  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  KCS and TMM  shall  consult  with each  other  before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment on and concur
with,  any  press  release  or  other  public  statement  with  respect  to this
Stockholders'  Agreement,  except  as KCS  or TMM  may  determine  is  otherwise
required by Applicable Law, judicial or administrative action or any requirement
of the  Mexican  Stock  Exchange,  the New  York  Stock  Exchange  or any  other
applicable self-regulatory organization.

     9.14 COOPERATION ON TMM  DISTRIBUTION.  KCS  acknowledges  that holders may
desire  to  effect  a  distribution  of  the  shares  of  Common  Stock  to  the
stockholders of TMM in a tax efficient manner (a "Spin-Off").  In the event that
TMM determines to effect a Spin-Off,  KCS will, and will cause its  subsidiaries
to,  take  commercially   reasonable  efforts  to  cooperate  with  TMM  in  the
consummation of the Spin-Off.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
if requested by TMM, KCS agrees to use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
effect the Spin-Off  Merger (as defined below) as promptly as practicable  after
receipt from TMM of notice of its intention to effect such Spin-Off Merger.  TMM
shall cooperate  fully with KCS, and shall reimburse KCS, for any  out-of-pocket
expenses that KCS incurs in connection with the Spin-Off  Merger,  including the
reasonable fees and expenses of KCS's counsel (other than any such expenses that
constitute   Registration  Expenses  (as  defined  in  the  Registration  Rights
Agreement) in the event that the Spin-Off Merger requires registration under the
Securities  Act (in which  case such  registration  shall  reduce by one (1) the
number of  registrations  required to be effected by KCS under  Section 2 of the
Registration  Rights  Agreement)) and shall indemnify and hold KCS harmless from
and against all costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever  (including taxes in
connection  therewith)  resulting  from,  arising out of, or due to, directly or
indirectly,  the Spin-Off Merger (other than with respect to matters as to which
KCS is  obligated  to  provide  indemnification  under the  Registration  Rights
Agreement).

     For purposes of this  Agreement,  the term  "Spin-Off  Merger" shall mean a
transaction  occurring  prior to that date which shall be one year following the
Effective  Time  (as  defined  in the  Acquisition  Agreement)  in  which  (i) a
newly-formed  entity  organized  under the laws of the UMS whose assets  consist
solely  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock  ("Holdco")  and the stock of which is
distributed  to the  holders of capital  stock of TMM is merged  with and into a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of KCS and, in such merger,  the outstanding  shares of
capital  stock of  Holdco  are  converted  into the  right  to  receive,  in the
aggregate,  a number of shares of Common  Stock equal to the number of shares of
Common  Stock held by Holdco;  (ii) Holdco  shall not have any  indebtedness  or
other obligations (other than any obligations related solely to its organization
and the holding of the shares of Common Stock, which obligations TMM shall agree
to indemnify KCS against pursuant to an indemnity agreement satisfactory in form
and  substance  to KCS and  TMM);  (iii) KCS and its  subsidiaries  shall not be
required to assume or become liable for any other liabilities as a result of the
Spin-Off  Merger (other than any  obligations or liabilities  resulting from the
registration  of the shares of Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant to the Spin-Off
Merger);  and (iv) KCS shall be reasonably  satisfied that the transaction  will
not  affect  adversely  in any  material  way  any  rights  of KCS or any of its
Affiliates under the Acquisition  Agreement or any of the Ancillary  Agreements,
including without limitation,  rights to receive any indemnification  determined
to be due thereunder.

Agreement to be duly executed by their respective  authorized officers as of the
date hereof.

     2. REQUIRED REGISTRATIONS.

     (A) Subject to the terms of this Registration  Rights  Agreement,  upon the
written  request (the "Request") to register any number of shares of Registrable
Stock  under  the  Securities  Act  made at any  time  prior  to the  five  year
anniversary  of the  Effective  Date of this  Registration  Rights  Agreement by
Holders of not less than 10% of the shares of Registrable  Stock  specifying the
intended method of disposition  thereof,  KCS will use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to effect the registration of Registrable Stock under the Securities Act
for disposition in accordance with the intended method of disposition  stated in
the Request,  to the extent  requisite to permit the  disposition (in accordance
with the intended method set forth in the Request) of the  Registrable  Stock to
be so  registered,  but  only  to the  extent  provided  for  in  the  following
provisions of this Registration Rights Agreement.  Whenever KCS shall,  pursuant
to this Section 2(A), be requested to effect the registration of any Registrable
Stock under the Securities  Act, KCS shall,  within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of the Request, give written notice of such proposed registration to all
Holders  of  Registrable  Stock,  stating  that such  Holders  have the right to
request  that any or all of the  Registrable  Stock owned by them be included in
such  registration  and specifying the intended filing date of the  Registration
Statement  relating  to such  Request  (which  date  shall be at least  ten (10)
Business  Days  after the date such  notice is sent to the  Holders).  KCS shall
include in such  registration  all  Registrable  Stock with respect to which KCS
receives  written  requests  from the  Holders  thereof  for  inclusion  therein
(stating the intended  method of disposition of such  Registrable  Stock) within
the ten (10)  Business  Days prior to the filing of the  Registration  Statement
relating to such request.  KCS will use commercially  reasonable efforts to file
the Registration  Statement relating to the Request to permit the disposition of
all  Registrable  Stock as to which KCS has  received  notices  from  Holders in
accordance  with the intended  methods of disposition  set forth in such notices
not later than thirty  (30)  Business  Days after  receipt by KCS of the initial
Request;  provided  that  KCS  shall  not be  required  to  file a  Registration
Statement  prior to the 180th day after the  consummation of the Acquisition (it
being understood that if a Request is made prior to such time the filing of such
Registration Statement shall be deferred until such 180th day). Thereafter,  KCS
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared  effective  at  the  earliest   practicable  time  and  shall  use  its
commercially  reasonable efforts to keep such Registration  Statement  effective
for the period of time  required to effect the  disposition  by such  Holders in
accordance with the intended method of disposition  described in the requests of
such  Holders,  all to the  extent  requisite  to  permit  such  sale  or  other
disposition by such Holders of the Registrable  Stock so registered.  So long as
KCS is eligible  to use Form S-3 (or any  successor  form) under the  Securities
Act,  any  Request  may  specify  that the  Registration  Statement  be a "shelf
registration" permitting the offering of Registrable Stock registered thereby on
a delayed or continuous  basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or
any successor

<PAGE>

rule),  in which  case,  KCS shall use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
maintain such Registration Statement continuously effective and usable for sales
thereunder  for a period of not more than one year;  provided that KCS shall not
be required hereunder to file more than one "shelf registration".

     (B) The foregoing registration rights of Holders of Registrable Stock shall
be deemed satisfied by KCS when six Registration  Statements  covering shares of
Registrable  Stock which KCS has been requested to register  pursuant to Section
2(A)  hereof  shall  have  been  filed by KCS with  and  made  effective  by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission  under the Securities  Act. To the extent an
underwritten   public  offering  is  the  intended  method  of  distribution  of
Registrable   Stock  with  respect  to  any  Request   submitted,   the  Holders
participating  in such  offering  shall have the right to select the  investment
banker or bankers  who shall  serve as the manager  and/or  co-managers  for the
offering of Securities  covered by such Registration  Statement,  subject to the
approval by KCS of such  selection,  which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld.

     (C) Any  registration  under  this  Section 2 shall be on such  appropriate
registration  form of the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (i) as shall be
selected  by KCS and (ii) as shall  permit the  disposition  of the  Registrable
Stock in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition specified
in Holders' requests for such registration.

     (D)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  KCS shall be  permitted to delay the
filing of any Registration  Statement  pursuant to this Section 2: (i) if KCS is
not eligible to use Form S-3 (or a comparable or successor  form) to effect such
registration;  (ii) if KCS,  within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Request,
gives notice to the Holders of its bona fide intention to effect the filing of a
Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the Request (other than a Registration Statement on Form
S-8), in which case KCS's obligation to file the Registration Statement pursuant
to this Section 2 shall be deferred for a period not to exceed  ninety (90) days
from the  date of the  Request;  or (iii) if KCS  shall  furnish  to  Holders  a
resolution  adopted by the Board of  Directors  of KCS to the effect that in the
good  faith  judgment  of KCS it would  be  seriously  detrimental  to KCS for a
Registration  Statement to be filed at that time,  specifying with particularity
the  basis  therefor   (subject  to  the  Holders   entering  into   appropriate
non-disclosure agreements) in which case KCS's obligation to file a Registration
Statement  shall be deferred for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the
receipt of the  Request.  KCS shall not be required  to effect any  registration
pursuant  to this  Section  2 once it has  effected  six  (6)  registrations  in
accordance with Section 2.

     (E) In determining the number of  registrations  effected  pursuant to this
Section 2, such  registrations  shall not  include any  registration  if (i) the
Registration  Statement did not become effective or remain in effect as required
by this  Section  2; or (ii) the  Registration  Statement  is  withdrawn  at the
request of the Holders and the Holders  agree to pay the  Registration  Expenses
associated with such Registration Statement.

     (F) KCS shall not permit any  securities of any other person to be included
in any  Registration  Statement  filed  pursuant  to this  Section 2, other than
securities sold for the account of KCS, without the consent of the Holders whose
Registrable  Stock is included in such  Registration  Statement,  which  consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

<PAGE>

     (G) KCS  shall use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  qualify  for
eligibility to use Form S-3 with respect to registrations  requested pursuant to
this Section 2.

     3. INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION.

     (A) If  KCS,  at any  time  after  the  180  days  following  the  date  of
consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Acquisition  Agreement,
proposes or is required to file a  registration  statement  under the Securities
Act  related  to the offer or sale of shares  of  Common  Stock on a form  which
permits  inclusion of the  Registrable  Stock (other than a registration on Form
S-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar  forms),  it will give written  notice to
all Holders of then existing  Registrable  Stock of its intention so to do. Upon
the written request of any such Holder given to KCS within fifteen Business Days
after receipt of any such notice,  KCS will,  subject to the  provisions of this
Registration Rights Agreement,  use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
such Registrable  Stock which such Holders shall have requested be registered to
be registered  under the  Securities  Act, to the extent  required to permit the
disposition   by  such  Holders  of  the   Registrable   Stock  so   registered.
Registrations  of Registrable  Stock under this Section 3 shall not constitute a
registration  effected  pursuant  to Section  2. To the  extent an  underwritten
public  offering is the intended  method of  distribution  of Registrable  Stock
included in a registration pursuant to this Section 3, KCS shall have the right,
in its sole  discretion,  to select the  investment  banker or bankers who shall
serve as the manager and/or  co-managers for all  registrations  of offerings of
Registrable Stock under this Section 3.

     (B)  Except as  provided  in  Sections  2 and 3 hereof,  KCS shall  have no
obligation to register any  Securities  held by any Holder under the  Securities
Act or under any foreign, state or other securities laws.

     4. REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES.  Whenever KCS is required by the provisions of
this Registration Rights Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the  registration of any Registrable  Stock under the Securities Act, KCS
will:

     (A)  Prepare  and file  (within  the period  required  by Section 2 for all
registrations  pursuant  to such  Section)  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission a Registration  Statement with respect to such Registrable  Stock and
use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause such  Registration  Statement to
become and remain  continuously  effective for a period  necessary to effect the
sale of the  Registrable  Stock  in  accordance  with  the  intended  method  of
disposition and the requirements of this Registration Rights Agreement, provided
that before filing a  Registration  Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
supplements  thereto, KCS will furnish to counsel for the Holders of Registrable
Stock  included  in such  Registration  Statement  copies of all such  documents
proposed to be filed, which documents (other than the documents  incorporated by
reference therein) will be subject to the review of such counsel.

     KCS's obligations under this Section 4 shall be subject to the following:

          (i)  If,  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement
     relating  to  Registrable  Stock,  KCS  shall  furnish  to  the  Holders  a
     resolution of its Board of Directors stating that KCS has determined in its
     good faith  judgment  that the sale of  Registrable  Stock by such  Holders
     pursuant to the Registration Statement would require disclosure of material
     non-public information,  the current disclosure of which would, in the sole
     judgment of the Board of

<PAGE>

     Directors  of  KCS,  be  materially  detrimental  to KCS  (an  "Information
     Blackout"), then KCS's obligation to file the Registration Statement and to
     use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Registration Statement
     declared effective shall be deferred for a period not to exceed the earlier
     of (x) the date upon which such  material  information  is disclosed to the
     public or (y) sixty  (60) days  after the Board of  Directors  of KCS makes
     such good faith determination (such period being the "Information  Blackout
     Period").

          (ii)  If  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement
     relating  to  Registrable  Stock,  KCS  shall  furnish  to  the  Holders  a
     certificate  stating that the Board of Directors of KCS has  determined  in
     its good faith judgment that KCS is required to file  financial  statements
     with the Securities and Exchange  Commission in connection  with a material
     acquisition or other event (a "Financial Statement  Blackout"),  then KCS's
     obligation to file the  Registration  Statement and to use its commercially
     reasonable  efforts to have such Registration  Statement declared effective
     shall be  deferred  for a period not to exceed the  earlier of (x) the date
     upon which such  financial  statements  are filed with the  Securities  and
     Exchange   Commission  (it  being   understood   that  KCS  shall  use  its
     commercially  reasonable efforts to file such financial  statements as soon
     as  practicable,  or (y) sixty  (60) days  after KCS makes  such good faith
     determination   (such  period  being  the  "Financial   Statement  Blackout
     Period").  Any such determination  shall be accompanied by a certificate or
     letter from KCS's  independent  auditors  to the effect that such  auditors
     agree  that such  financial  statements  are  required  to be  included  or
     incorporated  by  reference in such  Registration  Statement to permit such
     Registration  Statement to become  effective under the Securities Act or to
     permit continued sales thereunder, as the case may be.

          (iii) If a Registration  Statement  relating to  Registrable  Stock is
     effective,  upon  written  notice of an  Information  Blackout or Financial
     Statement  Blackout from KCS to the Holders,  KCS may request suspension of
     and the  Holders  shall  suspend  sales of  Registrable  Stock  by  Holders
     pursuant to such Registration Statement for the Information Blackout Period
     or the Financial Statement Blackout Period.

          (iv) KCS shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to ensure that the
     aggregate  number of days in any  period of  twelve  consecutive  months in
     which an Information Blackout or Financial Statement Blackout or a deferral
     pursuant to Section 2(D) is in effect shall not be more than ninety (90).

     (B) Prepare  and file with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  such
amendments  and  supplements to such  Registration  Statement and the Prospectus
used in  connection  therewith  as may be  necessary  to keep such  Registration
Statement effective for a period necessary to effect the sale of the Registrable
Stock  thereunder,  which  shall in no  event  exceed  120  days (or the  period
specified in Section 2 in the case of a shelf  registration)  and to comply with
the  provisions of the  Securities  Act with respect to the  disposition  of all
Registrable Stock covered by such  Registration  Statement during such period in
accordance  with the intended  method or methods of  disposition  by the Sellers
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement;

     (C)  Furnish  to each  Seller  such  number of copies of such  Registration
Statement and the exhibits thereto,  each amendment and supplement thereto,  the
Prospectus  included in the Registration  Statement  (including each preliminary
Prospectus),   all  documents   incorporated   by  reference  or  deemed  to  be
incorporated by reference in the Registration  Statement or the

<PAGE>

Prospectus,  and such other documents,  as such Seller may reasonably request in
order to  facilitate  the  disposition  of the  Registrable  Stock owned by such
Seller  covered by the  Registration  Statement in accordance  with the intended
method of disposition;

     (D)  Use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  register  or  qualify  the
Registrable  Stock  covered  by such  Registration  Statement  under  such other
securities  or blue sky  laws of such  jurisdictions  in the  United  States  of
America as each Seller shall reasonably  request,  to keep such registrations or
qualifications in effect for so long as such  Registration  Statement remains in
effect,  and do any and all other acts and things which may be  necessary  under
such  securities  or blue sky laws to  enable  such  Seller  to  consummate  the
disposition in such  jurisdictions of the Registrable Stock owned by such Seller
covered by such Registration Statement (provided,  however, that KCS will not be
required to (i) in the case of a registration pursuant to Section 3, register or
qualify such Seller's  Registrable Stock in any jurisdiction  where shares to be
sold by KCS or any  other  Person  initiating  such  registration  are not to be
registered  or  qualified,  (ii)  qualify  generally to do business as a foreign
corporation  in any  jurisdiction  where it would not  otherwise  be required to
qualify  but for this  subparagraph,  (iii)  subject  itself to  taxation in any
jurisdiction or (iv) consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction);

     (E) Notify  each  Seller,  at any time when a  Prospectus  relating  to the
Registrable  Stock of such  Seller  covered by such  Registration  Statement  is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event
as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration  Statement, as
then in effect,  contains  an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading
in light of the  circumstances  then  existing,  and at the  request of any such
Seller,  promptly  prepare a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that,
as thereafter  delivered to the purchasers of the  Registrable  Stock covered by
such  Registration  Statement,  such  Prospectus  will  not  contain  an  untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact  necessary to
make the statements  therein not misleading in light of the  circumstances  then
existing;

     (F) Cause all Registrable Stock covered by such  Registration  Statement to
be listed on the principal  securities  exchange on which Securities of the same
class are then listed;

     (G)  Make  available  for  inspection  by  any  Seller,   any   underwriter
participating in any disposition  pursuant to such Registration  Statement,  and
any attorney,  accountant or other agent retained by Sellers  holding at least a
majority of the Registrable Stock included in such registration  pursuant to the
provisions  of this  Registration  Rights  Agreement  such  financial  and other
records,  pertinent  corporate  documents  and  properties  of  KCS  as  may  be
reasonably  requested  by  such  party  in  connection  with  such  Registration
Statement  solely  for the  purpose  of  effecting  sales of  Registrable  Stock
included in such registration; and

     (H) In connection  with any  underwritten  offering  pursuant to Section 2,
Sellers shall (i) enter into an  underwriting  agreement in customary  form with
the  underwriters  participating  in the offering;  and (ii) provide  reasonable
cooperation  to the  underwriters  and the Holders in marketing the  Registrable
Stock; provided, that not more than one KCS officer (the chief financial officer
or other  appropriate  officer)  shall be required to  participate  in any "road
show" or similar  presentation  in  connection  with such  offering and any such
participation shall be subject to such officer's  availability,  shall be at the
Holders'  expense and shall be limited to offerings  with an aggregate  offering
price of at least $100 million.

<PAGE>

     In connection with any  registration  hereunder,  each Seller shall furnish
KCS such  information  regarding  such  Seller,  the  Registrable  Stock and the
intended plan of  distribution  thereof as KCS may from time to time  reasonably
request in writing and, if any Seller does not furnish such information prior to
the filing of the Registration Statement,  KCS may exclude the Registrable Stock
of such Holder from such Registration Statement.

     Each  Seller  shall  be  deemed  to  have  agreed  by  acquisition  of  the
Registrable Stock that, upon receipt of any notice from KCS of the occurrence of
any event of the kind described in Subsection (E) of this Section 4, such Seller
will forthwith  discontinue its disposition of the Registrable Stock pursuant to
the Registration Statement relating thereto until Seller's receipt of the copies
of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Subsection (E) of this
Section 4 and, if so directed by KCS, will deliver to KCS (at KCS's expense) all
copies,  other than  permanent file copies,  then in Seller's  possession of the
Prospectus  relating to the Registrable  Stock current at the time of receipt of
such notice.

     5. EXPENSES. With respect to the first four registrations effected pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2 and registrations which include Registrable Stock
pursuant to Section 3, KCS shall pay all Registration Expenses.  With respect to
any  registrations  effected  pursuant  to  Section  2  beyond  the  first  four
registrations, the Holders whose shares of Registrable Stock are included in the
applicable registration shall pay all Registration Expenses.

     6. INDEMNIFICATION.

     (A) In the event of a  registration  of any  Registrable  Stock pursuant to
this Registration  Rights Agreement,  KCS shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller,  each  underwriter (in the case of any  underwritten  offering) and each
person,  if any, who controls such Seller or  underwriter  within the meaning of
the Securities Act, and each officer, director,  employee and advisor of each of
the  foregoing  (each a "Seller  Indemnitee"),  against  any  expenses,  losses,
claims,  damages  or  liabilities,  joint  or  several,  to  which  such  Seller
Indemnitee may become subject under the Securities Act, any state securities law
or  otherwise,  including  any of the  foregoing  incurred in  settlement of any
litigation,  commenced or threatened,  insofar as such expenses, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon (i) any untrue  statement or alleged untrue  statement of any material fact
contained in any  Registration  Statement under which such shares are registered
under  the  Securities  Act,  any  preliminary  Prospectus  or final  Prospectus
contained therein, any summary Prospectus used in connection with any securities
being registered,  or any amendment or supplement  thereto; or (ii) any omission
or alleged  omission  to state  therein a material  fact  required  to be stated
therein  or  necessary  to  make  the  statements   therein,  in  light  of  the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) any violation
by KCS of the Securities Act or rules of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
thereunder or any blue sky laws or any rules promulgated  thereunder,  and shall
reimburse  each such  Seller  Indemnitee  for any  legal or any  other  expenses
reasonably  incurred by them in connection with  investigating  or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that KCS shall
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim,
damage  or  liability  arises  out of or is based  upon an untrue  statement  or
alleged  untrue   statement  or  omission  or  alleged  omission  made  in  such
Registration  Statement,  said  preliminary  Prospectus  or said  Prospectus  or
summary  Prospectus  or said  amendment or  supplement  in reliance  upon and in
conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to KCS by or on behalf of the
Seller or any underwriter  specifically for use in the

<PAGE>

preparation  thereof;  and  PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  that if any  expenses,  losses,
claims,  damages  or  liabilities  arise  out of or are  based  upon  an  untrue
statement,  alleged untrue statement,  omission or alleged omission contained in
any preliminary  Prospectus  which did not appear in the final  Prospectus,  KCS
shall not have any liability  with respect  thereto to any Seller  Indemnitee if
any Seller  Indemnitee  delivered a copy of the  preliminary  Prospectus  to the
person alleging such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and failed
to deliver a copy of the final  Prospectus as amended or  supplemented if it has
been  amended  or  supplemented,  to such  person  at or  prior  to the  written
confirmation of the sale to such person.

     (B) In the event of a  registration  of any  Registrable  Stock pursuant to
this Registration  Rights Agreement,  each Holder shall,  jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless KCS and each person, if any, who controls KCS within
the  meaning  of  the  Securities  Act,  each  officer  of  KCS  who  signs  the
Registration  Statement,  each  director  of KCS and each  underwriter  and each
person who controls any  underwriter  within the meaning of the  Securities  Act
(each a  "Company  Indemnitee"),  against  any and all  such  expenses,  losses,
claims,  damages or  liabilities  referred to in Section 6(A) if the  statement,
alleged  statement,  omission  or  alleged  omission  in  respect  of which such
expense,  loss, claim, damage or liability is asserted was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with  information  furnished in writing to KCS by or on behalf
of a Holder of Registrable  Stock  specifically  for use in connection  with the
preparation of such registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus,  Prospectus,
summary Prospectus, amendment or supplement.

     (C)  Promptly  after  receipt  by an  indemnified  party of  notice  of the
commencement of any action,  such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the  indemnifying  party,  notify the indemnifying
party in writing of the commencement  thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying  party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified  party otherwise than under this Article 6 or to the extent that
it has not been  prejudiced as a proximate  result of such failure.  In case any
such action shall be brought against any indemnified  party, and it shall notify
the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall
be entitled to  participate  therein  and, to the extent that it shall wish,  to
assume  the  defense  thereof,  with  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to such
indemnified party; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if the defendants in any such action
include  both  the  indemnified  party  and  the  indemnifying   party  and  the
indemnified  party  shall  have  reasonably  concluded  that  there may be legal
defenses  available to it and/or other  indemnified  parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties  shall have the right to select one separate  counsel to assert
such legal  defenses  (in which case the  indemnifying  party shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or
parties). Upon the permitted assumption by the indemnifying party of the defense
of such action,  the indemnifying  party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under this Article 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by such  indemnified  party in connection  with the defense  thereof (other than
reasonable costs of  investigation)  unless (i) the indemnified party shall have
employed one separate  counsel  (together  with any local counsel) in connection
with the  assertion  of legal  defenses  in  accordance  with the proviso to the
preceding sentence,  (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel
reasonably  satisfactory to the  indemnified  party to represent the indemnified
party within a reasonable time, (iii) the indemnifying  party and its counsel do
not  actively  and  vigorously  pursue the  defense  of such  action or (iv) the
indemnifying  party has  authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the
indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party.

     7. PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN  REGISTRATIONS.  No Holder may participate
in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell
such  Holder's  Registrable  Stock on the  basis  provided  in any  underwriting
arrangements  approved  by  the  persons  entitled  hereunder  to  approve  such
arrangements  and (ii)  completes  and  executes all  questionnaires,  powers of
attorney,  indemnities,  underwriting  agreements and other  documents  required
under the terms of such underwriting  arrangements;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that no
Holder of  Registrable  Stock shall be required to make any  representations  or
warranties or to provide  information in the Registration  Statement relating to
such  registration  except,  in either  case,  with  respect  to itself  and its
intended method of disposition of Registrable Stock.

     8. UNDERWRITING CUT-BACKS.

     (A) If

          (1) any Holder of Registrable Stock is entitled and wishes to register
     any Registrable  Stock in a registration made pursuant to Section 2 hereof,
     and

          (2) the offering proposed to be made by the Holder or Holders for whom
     such  registration is to be made is to be an underwritten  public offering,
     and

          (3) KCS wishes to register Securities in such registration, and

          (4) the  managing  underwriters  of such  public  offering  furnish  a
     written  opinion that the total amount of Securities to be included in such
     offering  would exceed the maximum  amount of  Securities  (as specified in
     such opinion)  which can be marketed at a price  reasonably  related to the
     then  current  market  value  of  such  Securities  and  without  otherwise
     materially and adversely affecting such offering,

then the  relative  rights to  participate  in such  offering  of the Holders of
Registrable  Stock, the holders of other Securities  having the right to include
such Securities in such registration, and KCS shall be in the following order of
priority:

          First:  The  Holders  of  Registrable   Stock  shall  be  entitled  to
     participate in accordance  with the number of shares of  Registrable  Stock
     which each such Holder shall request to be registered,  such  participation
     to be pro rata in  accordance  with the  number of shares  which  each such
     Holder  shall  request  be  registered  if,  pursuant  to  clause 4 of this
     Subsection  (A),  the total  amount of  Securities  to be  included  in the
     offering will be less than the number of shares of  Registrable  Stock that
     all of such Holders shall request be registered; and then

          Second: KCS shall be entitled to participate; and then

          Third:  All  holders of other  Securities  having the right to include
     such  Securities in such  registration  shall be entitled to participate in
     accordance with the relative priorities, if any, as shall exist among them.

     (B) If

          (1)  any  Holder  of  Registrable  Stock  entitled  to do so  requests
     registration of Registrable Stock under Section 3 hereof, and

<PAGE>

          (2) the offering  proposed to be made is to be an underwritten  public
     offering, and

          (3) the  managing  underwriters  of such  public  offering  furnish  a
     written  opinion that the total amount of Securities to be included in such
     offering  would exceed the maximum  amount of  Securities  (as specified in
     such opinion)  which can be marketed at a price  reasonably  related to the
     then current  market value of such  Securities  and without  materially and
     adversely affecting such offering,

then the  relative  rights to  participate  in such  offering  of the Holders of
Registrable  Stock, the holders of other Securities  having the right to include
such Securities in such registration, and KCS shall be in the following order of
priority:

          First: KCS or the persons  requesting such registration (if other than
     KCS) shall be entitled  to  participate  in  accordance  with the  relative
     priorities, if any, as shall exist among them; and then

          Second:  All other holders of  Securities  having the right to include
     such  Securities  in  such  registration  (including  the  Holders  of  the
     Registrable  Stock) shall be entitled to participate pro rata in accordance
     with the number of shares  requested by such holders to be included in such
     registration.

     9. MARKET  STANDOFF.  Each Holder  hereby  agrees that,  during the 10 days
prior to, and during the period of duration (up to, but not exceeding,  90 days)
specified  by KCS and an  underwriter  of  Common  Stock  or  Securities  of KCS
convertible  into Common Stock,  following the effective  date of a Registration
Statement  (or, to the extent  applicable,  a Prospectus  filed pursuant to Rule
424(b)) covering Common Stock or Securities of KCS convertible into Common Stock
that are being  offered  solely for the account of KCS, the Holder shall not, to
the extent requested by KCS and such  underwriter,  directly or indirectly sell,
offer to sell,  contract to sell  (including,  short  sale),  enter into any put
equivalent position (as defined by Rule 16a-1),  grant any option to purchase or
otherwise transfer or dispose of (other than to donees who agree to be similarly
bound) any Registrable  Stock, or in any economic interest therein,  held by the
Holder at any time during such period except  Registrable  Stock covered by such
Registration  Statement;  provided,  that (i) no Holder shall be subject to such
restriction  to the extent that KCS or any of its officers or directors  are not
subject  to any  such  restriction  and  (ii) if  KCS,  any of its  officers  or
directors or any other person  subject to any such  restriction is released from
any such restriction  then such restriction  shall expire with respect to all of
the  Registrable  Stock held by the Holders.  In order to enforce the  foregoing
covenant,  KCS  may  impose  stop-transfer  instructions  with  respect  to  the
Registrable  Stock of each Holder until the end of such period,  and each Holder
agrees that, if so requested,  such Holder will execute an agreement in the form
provided by the underwriter  containing  terms which are essentially  consistent
with the provisions of this Section 9.

     10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  Each Holder of Registrable Stock agrees that
any information  obtained pursuant to this  Registration  Rights Agreement which
is, or would  reasonably  be  perceived to be,  proprietary  to KCS or otherwise
confidential  will not be disclosed  without the prior  written  consent of KCS,
unless required to be included,  and until such inclusion,  in any  Registration
Statement  being  filed  pursuant  to  this   Registration   Rights

<PAGE>

Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  each Holder of Registrable Stock may
disclose  such  information,  on a need  to  know  basis,  to  their  employees,
accountants  or  attorneys  (so long as each such  person  to whom  confidential
information is disclosed  agrees to keep such  information  confidential)  or in
compliance  with a  court  order.  Each  Holder  of  Registrable  Stock  further
acknowledges,  understands and agrees that any confidential information will not
be utilized (a) in connection  with purchases  and/or sales of KCS's  Securities
except in compliance with applicable state and federal antifraud statutes or (b)
for any other purpose.

     11.  NOTICE  OF  PROPOSED   TRANSFERS.   The  Holder  of  each  certificate
representing  Registrable  Stock by acceptance  thereof  agrees to comply in all
respects with the provisions of this Section 11. Each certificate evidencing the
Registrable  Stock  transferred  as above  provided  shall bear the  appropriate
restrictive  legend set forth in  Section  9.9 of the  Stockholders'  Agreement,
except that such certificate  shall not bear such  restrictive  legend if in the
opinion  of  counsel  for such  Holder and  counsel  for KCS such  legend is not
required in order to establish  compliance  with any provision of the Securities
Act.

     12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  This Registration Rights Agreement shall inure
to the  benefit  of and be binding  upon the  successors  of any of the  parties
hereto; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, the rights and benefits of TMM, MM and the Principal
Stockholders  with respect to their ability to cause the Registrable Stock to be
covered by a Registration  Statement  pursuant to Section 2 and Section 3 hereof
may be assigned only to  transferees  who are Permitted  Transferees;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER that such  assignee  shall be entitled to such rights and benefits  only
upon becoming party to this Registration  Rights Agreement as to any Registrable
Stock held by such Permitted Transferee,  with all the rights and obligations of
its assignor under this Registration Rights Agreement, by delivering an executed
joinder to the other  parties to this  Registration  Rights  Agreement in a form
satisfactory to the parties thereto.

     13.  SEVERABILITY.  Whenever possible,  each provision of this Registration
Rights Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Registration Rights Agreement
is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will
be ineffective  only to the extent of such  prohibition  or invalidity,  without
invalidating the remainder of this Registration Rights Agreement.

     14.  DESCRIPTIVE  HEADINGS.  The descriptive  headings of this Registration
Rights  Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part

entire  agreement  by and among the parties  hereto with  respect to the subject
matter hereof.  There are no promises,  warranties or  undertakings,  other than
those set forth herein,  with respect to the registration  rights granted by KCS
with  respect to the  Registrable  Stock.  This  Registration  Rights  Agreement
supersedes  all prior  agreements  and  understandings  between the parties with
respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof;  provided  that,  in the  event of any
conflict  between  this  Registration  Rights  Agreement  and the  Stockholders'
Agreement or the Acquisition Agreement, the provisions of those other agreements
shall control.

     20.  AMENDMENTS,  GOVERNING LAW,  JURISDICTION AND VENUE. This Registration
Rights  Agreement  may be amended,  modified or  supplemented  only by a written
instrument  executed  by KCS and Holders of not less than a majority of the then
existing shares of Registrable Stock. Any term, covenant, agreement or condition
in this  Registration  Rights  Agreement may be waived  (either  generally or in
particular  instances  and either  retroactively  or  prospectively)  by written
instruments  signed  by KCS and  Holders  of not  less  than a  majority  of the
existing  shares of Registrable  Stock.  Any such waiver shall be limited to its
express  terms and shall  not be  termed a waiver of any other  term,  covenant,
agreement or condition.  This Registration Rights Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts  made and to be performed in that state  without  giving any effect to
any  choice  or  conflict  of law  provision  or rule  (whether  in the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
of any jurisdiction  other than the State of Delaware.  Each party hereto hereby
agrees that any proceeding  relating to this Registration Rights Agreement shall
be brought in a state court of New York or a federal  court located in New York.
Each party hereto hereby  consents to personal  jurisdiction  in any such action

               received by Consulting Firm under this Agreement;

               income  taxation in the U.S. in connection  with its  performance

               expected  to subject  Consulting  Firm or JSS to  taxation in the
               U.S.

     3. DUTIES.

     (a) PROVISION OF CONSULTING  SERVICES.  Consulting  Firm shall provide such

the Company  related to the  maintenance,  fostering and promotion of a positive
relationship   between  the  Company  and/or  its  Affiliates  and  high-ranking

devote  all  business  time  necessary  for the  performance  of the  Consulting
Services  hereunder.  Company  acknowledges that Consulting Firm will render the

Chief  Executive  Officer  of another  corporation  and may during the Term have
other or additional business  activities or interests,  including managing other
enterprises  and  managing  his  and  his  family's   investments  and  business
activities.  Nothing  herein shall be interpreted to require that JSS devote his
full time and full attention to providing the Consulting Services, provided that
during the Term (whether or not this  Agreement has been  terminated)  JSS shall
not be  employed  by or provide  any advice or  service  to any  Competitor,  as
defined in the Stockholders' Agreement.

<PAGE>

     4.  TERM.  The term of this  Agreement  shall be for a period  of three (3)
years,  commencing on the first  Business Day  following the Effective  Time and
terminating  on the third  anniversary  thereof,  unless  terminated  earlier in
accordance with SECTION 8 (the "TERM").

     5. CONSULTING SERVICES FEES AND ESCROW.

     (a)  Subject  to the  limitations  in this  Agreement,  Company  shall  pay
Consulting  Firm during the Term as  consideration  for providing the Consulting
Services  an annual  fee of  $3,000,000  (three  million  Dollars)  in cash (the
"ANNUAL FEE"),  which Annual Fee shall be paid no later than the last day of the
month  following  the first,  second and third  anniversary  of the date of this
Agreement  (the  "PAYMENT  DATE").  At Closing  (as  defined in the  Acquisition
Agreement), Company shall deposit the total amount of the Annual Fee for each of
the years  comprising the three (3) year Term equal to $9,000,000  (nine million
Dollars)  (the  "CONSOLIDATED  FEE")  in  an  escrow  account  (the  "CONSULTING
COMPENSATION   ESCROW").  The  Consolidated  Fee  deposited  in  the  Consulting
Compensation  Escrow  shall  be  held  and  released  by an  escrow  agent  (the
"CONSULTING  COMPENSATION  ESCROW  AGENT")  in  accordance  with the  terms  and
conditions  of this  Agreement  and the escrow  agreement  in the form  attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "CONSULTING COMPENSATION ESCROW AGREEMENT").

     (b) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement,  the Annual Fee
payable with respect to each  successive  one-year  period within the Term shall
not be paid on the  respective  Payment Date if the members of the Board who are
independent  directors of the Company,  as defined under the applicable rules of
the New  York  Stock  Exchange  (the  "NON-MANAGEMENT  DIRECTORS"),  shall  have
reasonably  determined in good faith prior to the applicable  Payment Date that,
during such one-year period (the "PAYMENT DATE PERIOD"),  Consulting Firm or JSS
has  failed to comply in one or more  material  respects  with the terms of this
Agreement,  which  failure was not remedied  within ten (10) Business Days after
written  notice from the  Non-Management  Directors  setting forth in reasonable
detail the actions which the  Non-Management  Directors believe  constitute such
failure  (collectively,  the  "PAYMENT  CONDITIONS").  In  the  event  that  the
Non-Management Directors determine that Consulting Firm or JSS has not satisfied
the  Payment  Conditions,  the  Non-Management  Directors  shall,  prior  to the
relevant  Payment Date,  provide written notice to Consulting Firm  specifically
identifying  the  manner  in which the  Non-Management  Directors  believe  that
Consulting Firm or JSS has failed to satisfy the Payment  Conditions during such
period and the Annual Fee which would have been paid  pursuant  to Section  5(a)
shall be forfeited.  In such case,  the Company shall provide  written notice to
the Consulting Compensation Escrow Agent prior to the relevant Payment Date that
the Payment Conditions have not been satisfied.  If the Consulting  Compensation
Escrow Agent has not received such written notice prior to the relevant  Payment
Date, the Consulting Compensation Escrow Agent shall transfer the Annual Fee for
such period to Consulting  Firm  pursuant to SECTION 5(A).  For purposes of this
Agreement, the determination of a majority of the Non-Management Directors shall
be deemed the determination of the Non-Management Directors.

     (c) As of the  date of  execution  of the  Consulting  Compensation  Escrow
Agreement, Consulting Firm shall control all investment decisions of the amounts
held in escrow by the  Consulting  Compensation  Escrow  Agent.  Subject  to the
Stockholders'  Agreement  and in a manner  that  complies  with  the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the  "EXCHANGE  ACT") and other

<PAGE>

applicable U.S. Laws and  regulations,  if so instructed by Consulting Firm, the
Consulting Compensation Escrow Agent may acquire shares representing the capital
stock of Company ("CONSULTING FIRM STOCK").

     6. VAT CLAIM AND PUT ADVISORY FEE. On the later of (i) the  Effective  Date
and (ii) the  Final  Resolution  of the VAT  Claim  and Put (as  defined  in the
Acquisition  Agreement),  Company shall pay to Consulting Firm $9,000,000  (nine
million Dollars),  which at the Company's  election upon ten (10) days notice to
Consulting  Firm may be paid in cash or common stock of the  Company,  valued at
the  Volume   Weighted   Price  (the  "VAT  CLAIM  AND  PUT  ADVISORY  Fee")  as
consideration  for Consulting  Firm's services to Company in connection with the
resolution  of the VAT Claim and Put advisory  services to Company.  The Parties
acknowledge  that the Final  Resolution  may occur prior to the Effective  Time,
which shall not affect the Company's obligation to make payment of the VAT Claim
and Put Advisory Fee pursuant to this Section 6.

     7. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF CONSULTING FIRM STOCK. Consulting Firm shall
not sell,  transfer,  assign,  pledge or otherwise  dispose of (whether  with or
without  consideration and whether  voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation
of law) ("TRANSFER") any interest in any shares of Consulting Firm Stock, except
in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders' Agreement.

     8. TERMINATION.

     (a)  EXPIRATION.  This Agreement  shall  terminate  automatically  upon the

promptly as practicable after conclusion of the hearing.

          (i)  The  arbitration  shall  be  conducted  in the  English  language
               pursuant  to the  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules of the  American
               Arbitration Association.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) each

               other Party that are reasonably related to the Dispute;  (B) each
               Party shall  provide to the other,  reasonably  in advance of any
               hearing, copies of all documents which a Party intends to present
               at such  hearing;  (C) all  hearings  shall  be  conducted  on an
               expedited   schedule;   and  (D)   all   proceedings   shall   be
               confidential,  except that either Party may at its expense make a
               stenographic record thereof.

          (ii) The Arbitrators shall endeavor to complete all hearings not later
               than 120 days after their tribunal has been  convened,  and shall
               make a final award as promptly as  practicable  thereafter.  Such
               award shall be  communicated,  in writing,  by the Arbitrators to
               the  Parties,  and shall  contain  specific  findings of fact and
               conclusions of law in accordance with the governing law set forth
               in SECTION 17(B).  Any award of such  Arbitrators  shall be final
               and binding upon the Parties to this  Agreement  and shall not be
               attacked by any of the Parties to this  Agreement in any court of
               law  and  may be  enforced  in  any  court  having

<PAGE>

               jurisdiction,  including expressly the courts of the State of New
               York, U.S., and the courts of the Federal District of Mexico. The
               Arbitrators  shall  apportion  all  costs  and  expenses  of  the
               arbitration,  including the Arbitrators' fees and expenses,  fees
               and  expenses  of experts and fees and  expenses  of  translators
               ("ARBITRATION  COSTS") between the prevailing and  non-prevailing
               Party as the  Arbitrators  shall  deem  fair and  reasonable.  In
               circumstances  where (A) a Dispute has been  asserted or defended
               against  on  grounds  that  the   Arbitrators   deem   manifestly
               unreasonable,  or  (B)  the  non-prevailing  Party  has  rejected
               participation  in procedures under SECTION 17(C), the Arbitrators
               may assess all Arbitration Costs against the non-prevailing Party
               and may include in the award the  prevailing  Party's  attorneys'
               fees and  expenses  in  connection  with any and all  proceedings
               under this SECTION 17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
               may the Arbitrators award multiple or punitive damages.

     (f)  Pursuant to an  agreement  of the Parties or a judicial  determination
that a Dispute is not subject to final and binding  arbitration  as set forth in
SECTION 17, each Party  irrevocably  agrees that any legal action or  proceeding
against it with respect to this Agreement and any  transaction  contemplated  by
this Agreement  shall be brought only in the courts of the State of New York, or
of Federal courts of the U.S. sitting in New York, and by execution and delivery
of this Agreement,  each Party irrevocably submits to the venue and jurisdiction
of each such court and  irrevocably  waives any  objection or defense such party
may have to venue or personal  jurisdiction in any such court for the purpose of
resolving any claim, dispute,  cause of action arising out of or related to this
Agreement  (including  any claim that the suit or action has been  brought in an
inconvenient  forum and any right to which it may become  entitled on account of
place of residence  or  domicile),  the alleged  breach of this  Agreement,  the
enforcement  of the terms of this  Agreement  and the other  terms  contemplated
hereby.  A final judgment in any suit,  action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in any court where  jurisdiction over the Parties may be had
or in which the Parties are subject to service of process.

     (g) Each of the Parties  irrevocably  appoints CT Corporation (the "PROCESS
AGENT"),  at 111  Eighth  Avenue,  New  York,  New  York  10011  (212-894-8940),
respectively  as its agent  and true and  lawful  attorney-in-fact  in its name,
place and stead to accept on behalf of each of the Parties and their  respective
properties and revenues,  service of copies of the summons and complaint and any
other process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding brought
in the State of New York,  and each of the Parties  agrees  that  failure of the
Process  Agent to give any  notice of any such  service of process to any of the
Parties  shall  not  impair  or  affect  the  validity  of such  service  or the
enforcement of any judgment based thereon.

     18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; EFFECTIVE TIME. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement  among the  Parties  with  respect to the  subject  matter  hereof and
terminates and supersedes all other prior  agreements and  understandings,  both
written and oral,  between the Parties with  respect to the terms of  Consulting
Firm's  engagement  or  severance  arrangements.  This  Agreement  shall  become
effective at the Effective Time.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first written above.

Unless otherwise specified herein, all capitalized terms used and not defined in
the following  Guaranty (as defined  below) shall have the meanings  ascribed to
them in the above Consulting Agreement.


JSS  hereby,   unconditionally  and  irrevocably,   personally  guarantees  (the
"GUARANTY"),  by way of an independent  obligation to Company, the obligation of
Consulting  Firm  pursuant to SECTION 12 of the  Agreement to indemnify and hold
Company  and each of its  Affiliates,  and each of  their  respective  officers,
directors, employees, members, stockholders, agents and representatives harmless
from and  against  all  Losses  (as such term is  defined  in  SECTION 12 of the
Agreement)  resulting  from,  arising out of, or due to, directly or indirectly,
the filing of a Labor  Lawsuit by Consulting  Firm or any  director,  officer or
employee of Consulting Firm, including JSS ("GUARANTEED OBLIGATION").  This is a
guaranty of payment and not of  collection  only.  If for any reason  whatsoever
Consulting  Firm shall fail or be unable  promptly to comply with the Guaranteed
Obligation,  JSS will promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from Company,  pay
or cause to be paid in lawful money of the U.S. the unpaid Guaranteed Obligation
then due and payable to Company  (in the  amounts and to the extent  required of
Consulting  Firm  under the  Agreement).  JSS  waives  any and all notice of the
creation,  renewal, extension or accrual of the Guaranteed Obligation and notice
of or proof of reliance by Company  upon this  Guaranty  or  acceptance  of this
Guaranty;  the Guaranteed  Obligation shall  conclusively be deemed to have been
created,  contracted or incurred,  or renewed,  extended,  amended or waived, in
reliance upon this  Guaranty;  and all dealings  between  Company and Consulting
Firm shall be conclusively  presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this Guaranty.  Guarantor agrees that (i) any notice provided in the manner
required  under the Agreement  shall be deemed to  constitute  notice to JSS for
purposes  hereof  and (ii) any  knowledge  of  Consulting  Firm  shall be deemed
knowledge of JSS for purposes  hereof.  The liability of the  undersigned  under
this Guaranty shall not be affected or excused by (x) any lack of enforceability
against  Consulting Firm of the Guaranteed  Obligation for any reason whatsoever
and (y) any other circumstance

<PAGE>

which  might  otherwise  constitute  a  discharge  of a  guarantor.  JSS  waives
promptness,  diligence and notices with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation and
this  Guaranty and any  requirement  that Company  exhaust any right or take any
action against Consulting Firm. Any term or provision of this paragraph which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,  be
ineffective  to the  extent  of  such  invalidity  or  unenforceability  without
rendering  invalid or  unenforceable  the remaining terms and provisions of this
paragraph or affecting  the  validity or  enforceability  of any of the terms or
provisions of this paragraph in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
paragraph is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted
to be only so broad as is enforceable.  This Guaranty is strictly limited to the
Guaranteed Obligations.

     Pursuant to the terms,  conditions  and provisions of this  Agreement,  the
Parties shall,  as the case may be, perform the following  marketing and related
services  and/or  enjoy  the  following  rights   pertaining  to  the  following
prescribed services (the "Services and Rights"):

     Section 2.1 MOST FAVORED NATIONS ARRANGEMENT.

          (a)  During the Term,  the KCS Group  shall,  upon the  request of any
     member of the Parent  Group,  provide to any member of the Parent Group any
     of the MFN Services,  as defined in Section 2.2 hereof,  that the KCS Group
     or the  Operating  Company is presently  providing  or  hereafter  provides
     within,  to or from  Mexico on terms which are no less  favorable  than the
     terms for like  volumes and  services on which such MFN Services are at the
     time provided to Logistics Companies. The terms of this Agreement shall not
     apply to any  traffic to which an Most  Favored  Nations  clause  which was
     entered into prior to the time KCS acquires control of TFM applies.

          (b) The rights of the Parent  Group under this Section 2.1 may not be,
     in whole or in part, directly or indirectly sold, transferred,  assigned or
     otherwise  conveyed by the Parent Group or any member  thereof to any other
     Person  other than to any  Affiliate  of the Parent Group who has agreed in
     writing to be bound by all of the  provisions of this  Agreement and a copy
     of such writing has been  delivered to Operating  Company.  For purposes of
     this  Agreement  a merger of Parent or another  member of the Parent  Group
     with another person will constitute an indirect transfer unless, after such
     merger:  (1) such other  person is an  Affiliate of the Parent Group or (2)
     persons  who in the  aggregate  control a majority  of the voting  stock of
     Parent or an Affiliate of Parent controls a majority of the voting stock of
     such other person.

          (c)  Notwithstanding  subsection  (a) of this Section 2.1 or any other
     provision  of this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  in the event that the KCS
     Group determines that there is an economic benefit to any member of the KCS
     Group from not  complying  with Section  2.1(a) with regard to any specific
     shipper,   then,   upon  written  notice  to  the  Parent  Group  expressly
     referencing  this Section 2.1(c) and stating that KCS Group will not comply
     with Section 2.1(a) with respect to said shipper, such non-compliance shall
     be excused with respect to said shipper for the term of this  Agreement and
     the Operating  Company's and KCS Group's failure to comply with Section 2.1
     shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. In the event that KCS
     Group gives such a written notice to the Parent Group more than three times
     during the Initial Term of this Agreement,  then the written notice must be
     accompanied  by  a  payment  in  the  amount  of  Fifty  Thousand   Dollars
     (US$50,000.00) for the written notice to be effective to excuse performance
     under Section 2.1(a).

     Section 2.2. EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO PROVIDE  ROAD-RAILER  SERVICES.  During the
Term of this  Agreement,  the  Parent  Group  shall  have  the  right  to be the
exclusive provider of Road-Railer  freight services over the Operating Company's
rail system within Mexico,  including the Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City corridor. The
KCS  Group  agrees  that it will not  sell,  market or  otherwise  provide  such
services  either  directly  or  indirectly  through  any other  person  over the
Operating Company's rail system within Mexico, including the Nuevo Laredo-Mexico
City corridor.  All of the prices charged to customers by Operating  Company for
such services  shall be determined  from time to time by the Operating  Company.
Parent Group agrees not to: (i) permit any third party,  directly or  indirectly
to use all or any part of the rights  granted in this section under the guise of
doing  its own  business  or (ii) to make any  agreement  to  handle  as its own
Road-Railer  equipment  of any other third  party which in the normal  course of
business would not be considered the equipment of Parent Group.

     Section 2.3. INTERMODAL SERVICES.  To the extent that the Operating Company
determines to utilize a third party to operate its intermodal  terminals  within
Mexico or to provide  other  services  of the type which are the subject of this
Agreement (including, without limitation,  inspection, pre-trip, repair of cars,
chassises, trailers and containers,  finished vehicles yard management,  loading
and  unloading  of cars  from  railcars)  at any  time  during  the Term of this
Agreement,  the Parent Group, to the extent that the members of the Parent Group
actually  perform such services with their own employees,  shall be preferred to
operate such intermodal terminals or to provide such services over any unrelated
third party,  provided,  in the Operating  Company's sole judgement,  reasonably
exercised,  that the standards of service and performance  offered by the Parent
Group are at least as high as those  offered by such  unrelated  third party and
that the parent Group shall have  offered to provide such  services on terms and
conditions  at least as favorable to the

<PAGE>

Operating Company as those offered by the unrelated third party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the KCS Group shall have the sole right at any time and from time
to time to determine  whether it shall operate any such intermodal  terminals or
provide  such  services in the United  States or Mexico  directly or through its
Subsidiaries.

     Section 2.4. ADDITIONAL  TRANSPORTATION  RELATED SERVICES. If the Operating
Company and its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  determine at any time during the
Term to have  transportation  logistics  services  provided by any  unaffiliated
third party in Mexico which are at the time provided by any member of the Parent
Group within Mexico or the United  States  through its own  employees,  then the
Parent  Group  shall  have  the  right to make a bid for the  provision  of such
services.  In order to allow the Parent Group an adequate  opportunity to make a
bid  for  the  provision  of  such  services,  the  Operating  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries  and Affiliates  shall invite the Parent Group at the time it seeks
bids for such services from any unaffiliated  third party,  providing the Parent
Group with at least the same notice that is provided to any  unaffiliated  third
party. Such services shall include, but are not limited to:

          (a) Drayage from intermodal  terminals to intermodal final destination
     and vice versa;

          (b) Logistic  coordination  for intermodal  traffic when provided to a
     third party; and

          (c)  Cross-dock  and  warehousing  operations  when  provided to third
     parties.

                                   ARTICLE III

                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

activities,  obligations and responsibilities  contemplated under this Agreement
in compliance with all Applicable Laws.

with the other Party or Parties, as the case may be, to perform and maintain the
services described in this Agreement as promptly as possible.

negotiation or performance of this Agreement,  whether such  information is oral
or  written,   and  whether  or  not  labeled  as  confidential  by  such  party
(collectively "Confidential Information"). "Nonpublic Information" shall include
all personally  identifiable  financial information and any list, description or
other grouping of consumers,  and publicly available  information  pertaining to
them, that is derived using any personally  identifiable  financial  information
that is not  publicly  available,  and  shall  further  include  all  "nonpublic
personal  information"  as  defined  by  federal  regulations  implementing  the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act, as amended from time to time. "Personally  identifiable
financial  information"  means any information a consumer provides to a party in
order to  obtain  a  financial  product  or  service,  any  information  a party
otherwise  obtains  about a consumer in  connection  with  providing a financial
product  or  service  to that  consumer,  and any  information  about a consumer
resulting from any transaction  involving a financial product or service between
a party and a consumer. Personally identifiable information may include, without
limitation,  a consumer's first and last name, physical address, zip code, email
address,  phone  number,  social  security  number,  birth  date,  and any other
information that itself  identifies or when tied to the above  information,  may
identify a consumer.

     Section 5.2. USE OF CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION.  For as long as Confidential
Information is in possession of a Party, such Party shall take reasonable steps,
at least  substantially  equivalent  to the  steps it takes to  protect  its own
proprietary  information,  to prevent  the use,  duplication  or  disclosure  of
Confidential  Information,  other than, by or to its employees or agents who are
directly  involved in  negotiating  or  performing  this  Agreement  and who are
apprised of their  obligations  under this Section and directed by the receiving
Party to treat such

<PAGE>

information  confidentially,  or except as required  by law or by a  supervising
regulatory  agency of a receiving  Party (with  information as to the amount of,
and manner of calculating the Purchase Price redacted where permitted).  Neither
Party  shall  disclose,  share,  rent,  sell or  transfer to any third Party any
Confidential  Information of the other Party or Parties, as the case may be. The
Parties  shall use  Confidential  Information  only as necessary to perform this
Agreement.

     Section 5.3 EXCEPTIONS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
obligation  or  liability  shall  accrue  hereunder  with  respect to any of the
information to the extent that such information:

          (a) Is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of acts by
     a Party or by its representatives or agents in violation of this Agreement;
     or

          (b) Is in the  possession  of the Party or of its  representatives  or
     agents prior to disclosure; or

          (c) Is or  becomes  available  to a Party from a source  that,  to the
     Party's  knowledge,  is not bound by a  confidentiality  agreement with the
     prohibiting such disclosure; or

          (d) Is, on the advice of  counsel,  required to be  disclosed  by law,
     regulation,  judicial  order or by other  legal  process.  If so advised by
     counsel,  the Party  that is  required  to make the  disclosure  shall give
     prompt  written  notice  to the  other  Party,  shall  seek the  entry of a
     protective  order  or  otherwise   protect  the   confidentiality   of  the
     Confidential Information being disclosed, and, if a protective order cannot
     be obtained,  the disclosing Party shall only disclose that portion of such
     Confidential Information as it is legally required to disclose.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              TERM AND TERMINATION

     Section 6.1.  TERM;  TERMINATION.  The initial term of this  Agreement (the
"Initial Term") shall be the period commencing on the Effective Date (as defined
in the AAA) of the Acquisition  and terminating on the fifth  anniversary of the
Effective Date; provided,  that thereafter this Agreement shall be automatically
renewed for periods of one (1) year unless either party gives written  notice of
intent to terminate to the other  parties not less than sixty (60) days prior to
expiration of the initial or any subsequent term. (The Initial Term as extended,
the "Term.")  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this Agreement  shall  terminate
automatically in the event that (i) TMM Logistics files any voluntary proceeding
under  any  bankruptcy  laws,  or if TMM  Logistics  has  filed  against  it any
involuntary proceeding under any bankruptcy law which is not dismissed or stayed
within 30 days,  in either case  seeking the  adjudication  of TMM  Logistics as
bankrupt  or seeking the  appointment  of a receiver  for its assets,  or (ii) a
Change of Control of the Parent Group occurs and the party effecting such Change
of Control is a Competitor,  as defined in the AAA.  This  Agreement may also be
terminated  by the  Operating  Company  or the KCS Group in the  event  that the
Parent  Group  or  TMM  Logisitics,  or any  officer,  director  or  controlling
shareholder of any of the Parent Group or TMM Logistics, has engaged in Improper
Conduct.

<PAGE>

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 7.1 MUTUAL INDEMNITY. Every Party (in such capacity, referred to as
"Indemnitor")  shall indemnify and hold the other Party or Parties,  as the case
may be,  and their  respective  shareholders,  directors,  officers,  employees,
representatives,   agents,  servants,   successors,  and  assigns  (collectively
"Indemnitees")  harmless from and shall  reimburse  Indemnitees  for any losses,
damages,  deficiencies,  claims,  causes  of action or  expenses  of any  nature
(including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and expenses)  incurred by  Indemnitees
arising  out of or  resulting  from any breach of any  warranty,  representation
covenant or obligation of Indemnitor under this Agreement.

     Section 7.2 INDEMNIFICATION  PROCEDURES.  After any Party obtains knowledge
of any claim,  action, suit or proceeding  (collectively a "Claim") for which it
believes  it is  entitled  to  indemnification  under this  Agreement,  it shall
promptly notify the other Party or Parties, as the case may be, of such Claim in
writing within ten (10) days after such  knowledge.  Every Party shall cooperate
with the other Party or Parties,  as the case may be, in every reasonable manner
(at the  Indemnitor's  sole  expense)  to  facilitate  the  defense of any Claim
subject to indemnification  hereunder.  Indemnitees'  failure to promptly notify
Indemnitor of a Claim shall not relieve the Indemnitor  from any liability under
this Section to the extent that Indemnitor is not materially  adversely affected
by such delay.  With respect to each such notice,  the Indemnitor  shall, at the
Indemnitees'  option,  immediately  take  all  reasonable  action  necessary  to
minimize  any  risk or  loss to the  Indemnitees,  including  retaining  counsel
satisfactory  to the  Indemnitees and taking such other actions as are necessary
to defend the Indemnitees or to discharge the indemnity  obligations  under this
Section.  If the Indemnitor does not timely and adequately conduct such defense,
the Indemnitees may, at their option and at Indemnitor's  expense,  conduct such
defense, contest, litigate or settle the Claim using counsel of their own choice
without  prejudice to their right of  indemnification  under this  Section.  The
Indemnitor shall pay on demand any liability  incurred by the Indemnitees  under
this Section. The Indemnitor shall not settle any claim in which the Indemnitees
are named without the prior written  consent of the  Indemnitees,  which consent
shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  The Indemnitees shall have the right to be
represented by counsel at their own expense in any contest, defense,  litigation
or settlement conducted by the Indemnitor pursuant to this Section.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 8.1  RELATIONSHIP.  The  relationships  among the Parties  shall be
those of independent contractors and no Party shall be or represent itself to be
an agent,  employee, or joint venturer of the other, nor shall any Party have or
represent  itself to have any power or authority to act for,  bind or commit the
other Party or Parties, as the case may be.

     Section 8.2  SURVIVAL.  The  provision of Sections 5, 7 and 8 shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

     Section 8.3 WAIVER OF DAMAGES.  NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY
FOR ANY ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,  INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT,

<PAGE>

PUNITIVE,  SPECIAL  OR  OTHER  DAMAGES  RELATED  IN  ANY  WAY  TO  THE  PARTIES'
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. OTHER THAN THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ON THE TERMS
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 2.1(c), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ONLY REMEDY
AVAILABLE TO EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT IS THE SPECIFIC  ENFORCEMENT  OF
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

     Section 8.4 NO WAIVER OF DEFAULTS. Any waiver of breach or default pursuant
to this Agreement will not be a waiver of any other subsequent default.  Failure
or delay by any Party to enforce any term or  condition of this  Agreement  will
not constitute a waiver of such term or condition.

     Section  8.5  SEVERABILITY.  To the  extent  that  any  provision  of  this
Agreement  is  found by a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  to be  invalid  or
unenforceable, that provision notwithstanding,  the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and such invalid or unenforceable
provision will be deleted.

     Section 8.6 ASSIGNMENT.  No Party or its Affiliate may assign any rights or
delegate any duties under this Agreement other than to an Affiliate,  subject to
restrictions  on assignment  by the Parent Group,  as provided in Section 2.1 b,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties,  as the case may be, and
any attempt to do so without that consent will be void.

     The rights granted under this Agreement shall terminate as to any Affiliate
at the time any such entity ceases to be an affiliate.

     party and believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine without being required

<PAGE>

     signature believed by it to be genuine, and may assume that any such person

          (b) KCS and TMM, jointly and severally,  agree to reimburse the Escrow
     Agent on demand for,  and to indemnify  and hold the Escrow Agent  harmless

     (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs and
     disbursements) that the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur in connection with
     this  Escrow  Agreement  in  its  performance  hereunder  or in  connection
     herewith,  except to the  extent  such loss,  liability,  damage or expense
     arises in the Escrow  Agent's  willful  misconduct  or gross  negligence as
     adjudicated  by a court of competent  jurisdiction.  The Escrow Agent shall
     have the right to apply the assets held by it in escrow hereunder,  and any
     proceeds  thereof,  to the payment of any amounts owing to it by TMM or KCS

          (c) As  between  themselves,  KCS and TMM agree that In the event that
     the Escrow Agent exercises its right to apply funds from the Escrow Fund to
     the  payment  of  any  amounts  owing  to  it  hereunder   ("Escrow   Agent
     Receivable")  as a  result  of the  failure  of  one of KCS or TMM to  make
     payment in full of 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable in  accordance  with
     Section 11 hereof,  such  non-paying  Party shall promptly  transfer to the
     account  of  the  other  Party  in  accordance   with  such  other  Party's
     instructions  in  immediately  available  funds  an  amount  equal  to  the
     difference  between 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable and the amount,  if
     any,  actually paid by the non-paying  Party to the Escrow Agent in respect
     of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable.  In the  event  that  the  Escrow  Agent
     exercises  its right to apply  funds from the Escrow Fund to the payment of
     the Escrow Agent  Receivable  as a result of the failure of both of KCS and
     TMM to make  payment  in  full of 50% of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable  in
     accordance  with  Section  11  hereof,  each such  non-paying  Party  shall
     promptly transfer to the account of the other Party in accordance with such
     other Party's  instructions in immediately  available funds an amount equal
     to the  difference  between  50% of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable  and the
     amount,  if any,  actually paid by the non-paying Party to the Escrow Agent
     in respect of the Escrow Agent Receivable.

     6.   (a) The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel of its selection in the
     event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or  construction  of any
     of the  provisions of this  Agreement or its duties  hereunder,  including,
     without  limitation,  the validity of any order of any court or arbitration
     tribunal,  and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully  protected in
     acting  or  refraining  from  acting in  accordance  with the  opinion  and
     instructions of such counsel.

          (b) Each of the Parties  acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent
     (i)  shall  not be  deemed  to  have  knowledge  of  the  terms  of,  or be
     responsible  for, any of the  agreements  referred to or  described  herein
     (including,  without limitation,  the Acquisition

<PAGE>

     Agreement,  but excluding  this  Agreement) or for  determining  compliance
     therewith  and shall  not  otherwise  be bound  thereby  and (ii)  shall be
     obligated only for the performance of such duties as are  specifically  set
     forth in this  Agreement on its part to be performed and no implied  duties
     or obligations  of any kind shall be read into this  Agreement  against the
     Escrow Agent.

     7. In the event of any  disagreement  between  any of the  Parties  to this
Agreement,  any  adverse  claims or demands  being made in  connection  with the
subject  matter of the escrow,  or in the event that the Escrow  Agent,  in good
faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder,  the Escrow Agent
may, at its sole option,  refuse to comply with any claims and demands on it and
retain in its possession  without liability to anyone all or any of the property
held by it hereunder,  or refuse to take any other action hereunder,  so long as
such  disagreement  continues or such doubt  exists.  The Escrow Agent shall not
become  liable in any way or to any person for its  failure or refusal to act in
such event,  and the Escrow  Agent shall be entitled to continue to refrain from
acting  until (i) the rights of all  parties  shall have been fully and  finally
adjudicated  by a court of competent  jurisdiction  or  arbitration  tribunal of
competent jurisdiction (and in the case of an arbitration tribunal,  accompanied
by a certificate  signed by an  Appropriate  Officer of KCS and TMM stating that
such  arbitration  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Section  12.11  of the
Acquisition  Agreement),  accompanied  by an opinion of counsel that such order,
decree or judgment is final, or (ii) all differences shall have been resolved by
agreement  among all the  interested  persons,  and Escrow Agent shall have been
notified thereof in writing signed by all such persons.  Escrow Agent shall have
the option,  after  thirty (30)  calendar  days  notice to the  Parties,  of its
intention to do so, to file an action in  interpleader  requiring the Parties to
answer and litigate any claims and rights  among  themselves.  The rights of the
Escrow Agent under this  paragraph  are  cumulative of all other rights which it
may have by law or otherwise.

     8. Notice to the Parties shall be given as provided  below.  Whenever under
the terms hereof the time for giving a notice or  performing an act falls upon a
Saturday, a Sunday or a banking holiday in New York, such time shall be extended
to the next day on which the Escrow Agent is open for business.

     9. The Escrow Agent may, in its sole  discretion,  resign and terminate its
position  hereunder  at any time  following  thirty (30)  calendar  days written
notice to the other Parties to the Escrow Agreement. Prior to the effective date
of  resignation  specified  in such notice,  the Parties will jointly  appoint a
successor  escrow agent. On the effective date of such  appointment,  the Escrow
Agent shall  deliver  this Escrow  Agreement  together  with any and all related
instruments or documents and all of the funds,  securities,  documents and other
assets  held in escrow  hereunder  to any  successor  escrow  agent  selected in
writing by Parties to this Agreement.  If a successor  escrow agent has not been
appointed  prior to the  expiration of thirty (30)  calendar days  following the
date  of  notice  of  such  resignation,   then  (i)  the  Escrow  Agent's  sole
responsibility  after that time shall be

<PAGE>

to safekeep the property  held in escrow by it hereunder  until receipt by it of
designation  of a successor  escrow agent and (ii) the Escrow Agent may petition
any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the appointment of a successor  escrow
agent, or other  appropriate  relief.  Any such resulting  appointment  shall be
binding upon all the Parties to this Agreement.

     10. The Parties to this  Agreement may by mutual  written  agreement with a
copy of such  agreement  forwarded to the Escrow Agent at any time  substitute a
new escrow agent by giving ten (10) days notice  thereof to the Escrow Agent and
paying all fees and  expenses  due to the Escrow  Agent.  Any such  substitution
shall terminate all obligations and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. On the
effective  date of such  substitution,  the  Escrow  Agent  shall  deliver  this
Agreement together with any and all related  instruments or documents and all of
the funds, securities,  documents and other assets held in escrow hereunder to a
successor escrow agent that the Parties have selected in writing.

     11. The Escrow Agent shall  receive the fees provided in Appendix B hereto.
Except as set  forth in  Section  5(b)  above,  the  Escrow  Agent  shall not be
permitted  to utilize the Escrow Fund to cover any of its fees or  expenses.  As
between  themselves,  KCS and TMM agree that all fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent shall be paid equally (50% by KCS and 50% by TMM).

     12.  Any  modification  of this  Agreement  or any  additional  obligations
assumed by any party  hereto  shall be binding  only if  evidenced  by a writing
signed by each of the parties  hereto.  Upon  distribution in full of the Escrow
Fund,  this Agreement  shall be thereupon  terminated and of no further force or
effect;  provided  that the  provisions  of Section  5(b) and 11 (for the period
prior to such  termination,  resignation  or  substitution)  shall  survive  the
termination of this Agreement and the  resignation or substitution of the Escrow
Agent.

     13. This  Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York
in all respects.  The Parties hereto irrevocably and  unconditionally  submit to
the  jurisdiction  of a federal or state court located in New York,  New York in
connection with any proceedings commenced regarding this Agreement including but
not limited to a interpleader proceeding or a proceeding for the employment of a
successor  escrow agent. The Parties  irrevocably  submit to the jurisdiction of
such courts for the  determination  of all issues in such  proceedings,  without
regard  to any  principles  of  conflicts  of laws,  and  irrevocably  waive any
objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

                           INDEMNITY ESCROW AGREEMENT


     This INDEMNITY  ESCROW  AGREEMENT  (this  "Agreement")  is entered into and
effective  as of this  15th day of  December,  2004,  by and among  KANSAS  CITY
SOUTHERN,  a  Delaware  corporation  ("KCS"),  Caymex  Transportation,  Inc.,  a
Delaware corporation "Caymex"), KARA Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("KARA"),
KCS Investment I, Ltd., a Delaware  corporation ("KCS Investment") (KCS, Caymex,
KARA, and KCS Investment  are sometimes  collectively  referred to herein as the
"KCS Purchasers"),  GRUPO TMM, S.A., a SOCIEDAD ANONIMA organized under the laws
of the United  Mexican  States  ("UMS")  and TMM  Multimodal,  S.A.  de C.V.,  a
SOCIEDAD ANONIMA DE CAPITAL VARIABLE  organized under the laws of the UMS ("MM")
(MM and TMM, collectively with the KCS Purchasers,  are collectively referred to
herein as the  "Parties")  and The Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company of New York
(the "Escrow Agent").

     WHEREAS,  the Parties are parties to the Amended and  Restated  Acquisition
Agreement  dated as of the date hereof  among the KCS  Purchasers,  TMM, and the
other parties named therein (the "Acquisition Agreement"), pursuant to which the
TMM Parties will sell and the KCS Purchasers will purchase  substantially all of
MM's interest in Grupo Transportacion  Ferroviaria  Mexicana,  S.A. de C.V. upon
the terms and conditions set forth in the Acquisition Agreement;

     WHEREAS,  a  portion  of the  consideration  for the  Acquisition  is to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (the "Indemnity Escrow"), which escrow is being established to provide
available funds to satisfy the indemnity claims as provided herein;

     WHEREAS,  at the Closing (as defined in the Acquisition  Agreement) the KCS
Purchasers  will deposit with the Escrow Agent one or more  promissory  notes of
KCS  in  the  aggregate   principal   amount  of  Forty-Seven   Million  Dollars
($47,000,000) (the "Indemnity Escrow Notes") to be held in the Indemnity Escrow,
and released only pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS,  the  Parties  desire  to  appoint  the  Escrow  Agent to hold the
Indemnity  Escrow Notes on the terms and  conditions set forth in this Agreement
and the Escrow Agent is willing to serve in that capacity.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises and agreements  contained
herein,  and  for  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the Parties, it is hereby agreed
by and among the Parties and the Escrow Agent as follows:

     1. The Parties  hereby  appoint the Escrow  Agent to serve as escrow  agent
hereunder.  In accordance  with and subject to the terms and provisions  hereof,
the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to hold,  reduce the
principal  amount of, and deliver the Indemnity  Escrow Notes in accordance with
the terms hereof.

<PAGE>

     2.   (a) At the Closing,  the KCS Purchasers  shall deposit with the Escrow
     Agent the  Indemnity  Escrow  Notes to be held by the  Escrow  Agent in the
     Indemnity  Escrow and reduced and delivered  only pursuant to the terms and
     conditions of this Agreement.

          (b) In the event that KCS  exercises its option to convert any portion
     of the Indemnity  Escrow Notes to shares of KCS Common Stock  ("Shares") in
     accordance  with  the  terms  thereof,   KCS  shall  deliver  one  or  more
     certificates representing such Shares to the Escrow Agent to be held by the
     Escrow Agent in the  Indemnity  Escrow and  delivered  only pursuant to the
     terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement.  In the event that the number of
     Shares to be delivered to MM is reduced in accordance with Section 3 hereof
     after delivery of such  certificate or  certificates,  KCS shall substitute
     one or more certificates  representing the appropriate  number of Shares to
     be delivered on the Payment Date.

     3. The principal  amount of the Indemnity Escrow Notes, or number of Shares
held in the Indemnity  Escrow,  shall be reduced only upon the occurrence of any
of the following:

          (a) If the Escrow Agent receives joint written  instructions  from KCS
     and TMM to make such reduction, specifying the amount thereof;

          (b) If the Escrow Agent receives written instructions from KCS to make
     such reduction,  specifying the amount thereof,  simultaneously  copied and
     sent by same means to TMM,  and the Escrow  Agent does not receive  written
     objection  from TMM to such  instructions  within  ten (10)  Business  Days
     (defined below) of the date of such instructions are received by the Escrow
     Agent. As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean a day of the year
     on  which  national  banks in New  York,  New  York,  are not  required  or
     permitted to be closed; or

          (c) If the Escrow Agent receives a final order,  decree or judgment of
     a court of competent  jurisdiction or arbitration tribunal (and in the case
     of an  arbitration  tribunal,  accompanied  by a certificate  signed by the
     President or a Vice-President  (each, an "Appropriate  Officer") of KCS and
     TMM stating that such arbitration was undertaken in accordance with Section
     12.11 of the Acquisition  Agreement),  accompanied by an opinion of counsel
     that such order, decree or judgment is final.

     The Escrow Agent shall mark on Schedule A to each of the  Indemnity  Escrow
Notes the amount of each  reduction in the principal  amount thereof as provided
in this Section 3.

     4. The Parties  agree that any dispute  between the Parties  arising  under
this  Agreement  shall be resolved  in  accordance  with the dispute  resolution
procedures  set forth in  Sections  10.5(e)  or 12.11,  as  appropriate,  of the
Acquisition Agreement.

     5. On June 1, 2007 (the "Payment Date"),  the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
MM the Indemnity Escrow Notes, as reduced pursuant to Section 3 hereof,  and, if
any part of the

<PAGE>

Indemnity Escrow Notes have been converted to Shares,  any such Shares then held
by it in the  Indemnity  Escrow.  In  the  event  that  there  is an  unresolved
objection  from TMM  pursuant  to  Section  3(b) with  respect  to any claim for
reduction of the principal  amount of the Indemnity  Escrow Notes (or Shares) on
the Payment  Date,  the Escrow Agent shall deliver that portion of the Indemnity
Escrow  Notes  (or  Shares)  to MM  which  is not  subject  to  such  unresolved
objection,  if any, and shall deliver the balance of such Indemnity Escrow Notes
or Shares,  as the case may be, as directed by joint written  instructions  from
KCS and TMM, or a final  order,  decree,  or judgment of a court or  arbitration
tribunal of competent  jurisdiction (and in the case of an arbitration tribunal,
accompanied  by a certificate  signed by an  Appropriate  Officer of KCS and TMM
stating that such arbitration was undertaken in accordance with Section 12.11 of
the  Acquisition  Agreement),  accompanied  by an opinion  of counsel  that such
order, decree or judgment is final. KCS shall provide to the Escrow Agent one or
more  Indemnity   Escrow  Notes  or  stock   certificates   in  the  appropriate
denominations for delivery pursuant to this Section 5.

     6.   (a) The Escrow Agent may act or refrain  from acting in reliance  upon
     any instructions,  notice, certification,  demand, consent,  authorization,
     receipt,  power of attorney or other  writing  delivered to it by any other
     party and believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine without being required
     to determine the authenticity or validity thereof or the correctness of any
     facts  stated  therein.  The Escrow Agent may act or refrain from acting in
     reliance  upon any signature  believed by it to be genuine,  and may assume
     that any such person has been properly authorized to do so.

          (b) KCS and TMM, jointly and severally,  agree to reimburse the Escrow
     Agent on demand for,  and to indemnify  and hold the Escrow Agent  harmless
     against and with respect to, any and all loss, liability, damage or expense
     (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs and
     disbursements) that the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur in connection with
     this  Escrow  Agreement  in  its  performance  hereunder  or in  connection
     herewith,  except to the  extent  such loss,  liability,  damage or expense
     arises in the Escrow  Agent's  willful  misconduct  or gross  negligence as
     adjudicated  by a court of competent  jurisdiction.  The Escrow Agent shall
     have the right to apply the Indemnity  Escrow Notes or Shares held by it in
     escrow hereunder,  and any proceeds thereof,  to the payment of any amounts
     owing to it by TMM or KCS hereunder  upon one (1) business  days' notice to
     TMM and KCS.

          (c) As  between  themselves,  TMM and KCS agree that in the event that
     the Escrow  Agent  exercises  its right to apply  funds from the  Indemnity
     Escrow Notes or Shares to the payment of any amounts  owing to it hereunder
     ("Escrow Agent Receivable") as a result of the failure of one of KCS or TMM
     to make payment in full of 50% of the Escrow Agent Receivable in accordance
     with Section 11 hereof,  such non-paying  Party shall promptly  transfer to
     the  account  of the other  Party in  accordance  with such  other  Party's
     instructions  in  immediately  available  funds  an  amount  equal  to  the
     difference  between 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable and the amount,  if
     any,  actually paid by the non-paying  Party to the Escrow Agent in respect
     of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable.  In the  event  that  the  Escrow  Agent
     exercises  its right to apply

<PAGE>

     funds  from the  Indemnity  Escrow  Notes or Shares to the  payment  of the
     Escrow Agent  Receivable  as a result of the failure of both of KCS and TMM
     to make payment in full of 50% of the Escrow Agent Receivable in accordance
     with Section 11 hereof,  each such non-paying Party shall promptly transfer
     to the account of the other  Party in  accordance  with such other  Party's
     instructions  in  immediately  available  funds  an  amount  equal  to  the
     difference  between 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable and the amount,  if
     any,  actually paid by the non-paying  Party to the Escrow Agent in respect
     of the Escrow Agent Receivable.

     7.   (a) The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel of its selection in the
     event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or  construction  of any
     of the  provisions of this  Agreement or its duties  hereunder,  including,
     without  limitation,  the validity of any order of any court or arbitration
     tribunal,  and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully  protected in
     acting  or  refraining  from  acting in  accordance  with the  opinion  and
     instructions of such counsel.

          (b) Each of the Parties  acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent
     (i)  shall  not be  deemed  to  have  knowledge  of  the  terms  of,  or be
     responsible  for, any of the  agreements  referred to or  described  herein
     (including,  without limitation,  the Acquisition Agreement,  but excluding
     this  Agreement)  or for  determining  compliance  therewith  and shall not
     otherwise  be bound  thereby  and  (ii)  shall  be  obligated  only for the
     performance of such duties as are  specifically set forth in this Agreement
     on its part to be performed  and no implied  duties or  obligations  of any
     kind shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent.

     8. In the event of any  disagreement  between  any of the  Parties  to this
Agreement,  any  adverse  claims or demands  being made in  connection  with the
subject  matter of the escrow,  or in the event that the Escrow  Agent,  in good
faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder,  the Escrow Agent
may, at its sole option,  refuse to comply with any claims and demands on it and
retain in its possession  without liability to anyone all or any of the property
held by it hereunder,  or refuse to take any other action hereunder,  so long as
such  disagreement  continues or such doubt  exists.  The Escrow Agent shall not
become  liable in any way or to any person for its  failure or refusal to act in
such event,  and the Escrow  Agent shall be entitled to continue to refrain from
acting  until (i) the rights of all  parties  shall have been fully and  finally
adjudicated  by a court of competent  jurisdiction  or  arbitration  tribunal of
competent jurisdiction (and in the case of an arbitration tribunal,  accompanied
by a certificate  signed by an  Appropriate  Officer of KCS and TMM stating that
such  arbitration  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Section  12.11  of the
Acquisition  Agreement),  accompanied  by an opinion of counsel that such order,
decree or judgment is final, or (ii) all differences shall have been resolved by
agreement  among all the  interested  persons,  and Escrow Agent shall have been
notified thereof in writing signed by all such persons.  Escrow Agent shall have
the option,  after  thirty (30)  calendar  days  notice to the  Parties,  of its
intention to do so, to file an action in  interpleader  requiring the Parties to
answer and litigate any claims and rights  among  themselves.  The rights of the
Escrow Agent under this  paragraph  are  cumulative of all other rights which it
may have by law or otherwise.

<PAGE>

     9.  Notice  to the  Parties  and to the  Escrow  Agents  shall  be given as
provided below.  Whenever under the terms hereof the time for giving a notice or
performing  an act falls upon a Saturday,  a Sunday or a banking  holiday in New
York,  such time shall be extended to the next day on which the Escrow  Agent is
open for business.

     10. The Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion,  resign and terminate its
position  hereunder  at any time  following  thirty (30)  calendar  days written
notice to the other Parties to the Escrow Agreement. Prior to the effective date
of  resignation  specified  in such notice,  the Parties will jointly  appoint a
successor  escrow agent. On the effective date of such  appointment,  the Escrow
Agent shall  deliver  this Escrow  Agreement  together  with any and all related
instruments or documents and all of the funds,  securities,  documents and other
assets  held in escrow  hereunder  to any  successor  escrow  agent  selected in
writing by Parties to this Agreement.  If a successor  escrow agent has not been
appointed  prior to the  expiration of thirty (30)  calendar days  following the
date  of  notice  of  such  resignation,   then  (i)  the  Escrow  Agent's  sole
responsibility  after that time shall be to safekeep the property held in escrow
by it hereunder  until receipt by it of designation of a successor  escrow agent
and (ii) the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction  for
the appointment of a successor escrow agent, or other  appropriate  relief.  Any
such  resulting  appointment  shall  be  binding  upon all the  Parties  to this
Agreement.

     11. The Parties to this Agreement may by mutual written  agreement,  with a
copy of such agreement  forwarded to the Escrow Agent,  at any time substitute a
new escrow agent by giving ten (10) days notice  thereof to the Escrow Agent and
paying all fees and  expenses  due to the Escrow  Agent.  Any such  substitution
shall terminate all obligations and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. On the
effective  date of such  substitution,  the  Escrow  Agent  shall  deliver  this
Agreement together with any and all related  instruments or documents and all of
the funds, securities,  documents and other assets held in escrow hereunder to a
successor escrow agent that the Parties have selected in writing.

     12. The Escrow Agent shall  receive the fees provided in Appendix A hereto.
Except as provided in Section  6(b),  the Escrow Agent shall not be permitted to
utilize the Escrow Fund to cover any of its fees or expenses.  TMM and KCS agree
that as between  themselves,  all fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be
paid equally (50% by KCS and 50% by TMM).

     13.  Any  modification  of this  Agreement  or any  additional  obligations
assumed by any party  hereto  shall be binding  only if  evidenced  by a writing
signed  by each of the  parties  hereto.  Upon the  earlier  to occur of (i) the
reduction of the Indemnity  Escrow Notes in full principal  amount,  or (ii) the
delivery of the Indemnity  Escrow Notes or Shares to MM, this Agreement shall be
thereupon  terminated  and of no  further  force or  effect;  provided  that the
provisions  of Sections  6(b) and 12 (for the period prior to such  termination,
resignation or substitution) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
the resignation or substitution of the Escrow Agent.

<PAGE>

     14. This  Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York
in all respects.  The Parties hereto irrevocably and  unconditionally  submit to
the  jurisdiction  of a federal or state court located in New York,  New York in
connection with any proceedings commenced regarding this Agreement including but
not limited to a interpleader proceeding or a proceeding for the employment of a
successor  escrow agent. The Parties  irrevocably  submit to the jurisdiction of
such courts for the  determination  of all issues in such  proceedings,  without
regard  to any  principles  of  conflicts  of laws,  and  irrevocably  waive any
objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

     15. This  Agreement  may be executed in one or more  counterparts,  each of
which  counterpart  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  original  and  all  of  which
counterparts, taken together, shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

     16. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices and other  communications
hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed  given if (a)  delivered  in
person, (b) transmitted by facsimile (with written confirmation),  (c) mailed by
certified or  registered  mail (return  receipt  requested)  (in which case such
notice  shall be  deemed  given on the  third day  after  such  mailing)  or (d)

     WHEREAS,  pursuant to Section 7.13 of the Amended and Restated  Acquisition
Agreement  dated as of the date hereof  among the Parties and the other  parties

by and among the Parties and the Escrow Agent as follows:

     1. APPOINTMENT AND DEPOSIT INTO ESCROW.

          (a) The Parties  hereby  appoint  the Escrow  Agent to serve as escrow
     agent hereunder.  In accordance with and subject to the terms and provision
     hereof,  the Escrow Agent accepts such  appointment  and agrees to hold and
     distribute the VAT Escrow in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (b) On the later to occur  (the  "Deposit  Date")  of (i) the  Closing
     Date, or (ii) the Final Resolution of the VAT Claim and Put (as those terms
     are defined in the Acquisition Agreement),  KCS shall deliver to the Escrow

     Agreement,  a promissory note of KCS in the principal amount of $40 million
     (the "VAT Escrow Note").

          (c) The principal amount of VAT Escrow Note shall be reduced only upon
     the occurrence of any of the following:

<PAGE>

               (i) If the Escrow Agent receives joint written  instructions from
          KCS and TMM to make such reduction, specifying the amount thereof;

               (ii) If the Escrow Agent receives written  instructions  from KCS
          to make such reduction,  specifying the amount thereof, simultaneously
          copied  and sent by same means to TMM,  and the Escrow  Agent does not
          receive  written  objection  from TMM  within ten (10)  Business  Days
          (defined  below) of the date such  instructions  are  received  by the
          Escrow Agent. As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean a day
          of the year on which  national  banks in New York,  New York,  are not
          required or permitted to be closed; or

               (iii) If the  Escrow  Agent  receives  a final  order,  decree or
          judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction or arbitration tribunal
          (and  in  the  case  of  an  arbitration  tribunal,  accompanied  by a
          certificate  signed by the  President or a  Vice-President  (each,  an
          "Appropriate  Officer") of KCS and TMM stating  that such  arbitration
          was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Section  12.11  or  10.5 of the
          Acquisition Agreement),  and accompanied by an opinion of counsel that
          such order, decree or judgment is final.

     The Escrow Agent shall mark on Schedule A to the VAT Escrow Note the amount
of each reduction in the principal amount thereof as provided in this Section 3.

     2. The VAT Escrow shall be held for the  exclusive  benefit of the Parties,
their successors and assigns and no other person or entity shall have any right,
title or interest therein, except as provided in Section 5.

     3. The Parties  agree that any dispute  between the Parties  arising  under
this  Agreement  shall be resolved  in  accordance  with the dispute  resolution
procedures  set forth in  Section  10.5(e)  or  12.11,  as  appropriate,  of the
Acquisition Agreement.

     4.  On the  earliest  to  occur  (the  "Release  Date")  of (i)  the  fifth
anniversary of the Deposit Date (provided there is no unresolved  objection from
TMM  pursuant  to Section  2(c)(ii)),  (ii) the  receipt by the Escrow  Agent of
written  instructions  from KCS (provided there is no unresolved  objection from
TMM pursuant to Section  2(c)(ii)),  or (iii)  receipt by the Escrow Agent of an
order of a final order, decree or judgment of a court or an arbitration tribunal
(and  in  the  case  of  an  arbitration  tribunal  of  competent  jurisdiction,
accompanied  by a certificate  signed by an  Appropriate  Officer of KCS and TMM
stating that such arbitration was undertaken in accordance with Section 12.11 of
the  Acquisition  Agreement),  accompanied  by an opinion  of

<PAGE>

counsel  that such order,  decree or  judgment is final (a "Final  Resolution"),
that release of the VAT Escrow Note is otherwise ordered,

          (a) the VAT Escrow Note,  as reduced in  accordance  with Section 1(c)
     hereof,  shall  automatically  be converted  into the right to receive that
     number of shares of KCS Common Stock (the  "Shares") as provided for in the
     VAT Escrow Note; and

          (b) KCS shall issue and  deliver to MM one or more stock  certificates
     representing  the Shares  referenced in sub-section 4(a) and the VAT Escrow
     Note shall be returned by the Escrow Agent to KCS.

          (c) In the  event  that  there  is an  unresolved  objection  from TMM
     pursuant to Section 2(c)(ii) with respect to any claim for reduction of the
     principal  amount of the VAT Escrow Note on the Release Date, (i) KCS shall
     deliver to MM that  number of Shares as equal the portion of the VAT Escrow
     Note which is not subject to such  dispute,  if any, and shall  deliver the
     balance,  if any,  upon  agreement of the Parties or a Final  Resolution of
     such  dispute,  and (ii) the Escrow  Agent  shall  continue to hold the VAT
     Escrow Note, as reduced by any partial  payment  thereof in accordance with
     this Section  4(c),  in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement,  and
     shall  deliver  the  VAT  Escrow  Note  to  KCS  upon  receipt  of  written
     instructions  signed by both TMM and KCS as to the  disposition  of the VAT
     Escrow Note, or a Final Resolution of such dispute.

     5.   (a) The Escrow Agent may act or refrain  from acting in reliance  upon
     any instructions,  notice, certification,  demand, consent,  authorization,
     receipt,  power of attorney or other  writing  delivered to it by any other
     party and believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine without being required
     to determine the authenticity or validity thereof or the correctness of any
     facts  stated  therein.  The Escrow Agent may act or refrain from acting in
     reliance  upon any signature  believed by it to be genuine,  and may assume
     that any such person has been properly authorized to do so.

          (b) The Parties hereto, jointly and severally,  agree to reimburse the
     Escrow  Agent on demand for,  and to  indemnify  and hold the Escrow  Agent
     harmless against and with respect to, any and all loss,  liability,  damage
     or expense  (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees,
     costs and  disbursements)  that the  Escrow  Agent  may  suffer or incur in
     connection  with  this  Agreement  in  its  performance   hereunder  or  in
     connection herewith,  except to the extent such loss, liability,  damage or
     expense  is  caused  by the  Escrow  Agent's  willful  misconduct  or gross
     negligence as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Escrow
     Agent  shall  have the right to apply the VAT  Escrow  held by it in escrow
     hereunder, and

<PAGE>

     any proceeds  thereof,  to the payment of any amounts owing to it by TMM or
     KCS hereunder upon one (1) Business Days' notice to TMM and KCS.

          (c) As  between  themselves,  KCS and TMM agree that in the event that
     the Escrow  Agent  exercises  its right to apply  funds from the VAT Escrow
     Note to the payment of any amounts  owing to it  hereunder  ("Escrow  Agent
     Receivable")  as a  result  of the  failure  of  one of KCS or TMM to  make
     payment in full of 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable in  accordance  with
     Section 11 hereof,  such  non-paying  Party shall promptly  transfer to the
     account  of  the  other  Party  in  accordance   with  such  other  Party's
     instructions  in  immediately  available  funds  an  amount  equal  to  the
     difference  between 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable and the amount,  if
     any,  actually paid by the non-paying  Party to the Escrow Agent in respect
     of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable.  In the  event  that  the  Escrow  Agent
     exercises  its right to apply funds from the VAT Escrow Note to the payment
     of the Escrow  Agent  Receivable  as a result of the failure of both of KCS
     and TMM to make  payment in full of 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable  in
     accordance  with  Section  11  hereof,  each such  non-paying  Party  shall
     promptly transfer to the account of the other Party in accordance with such
     other Party's  instructions in immediately  available funds an amount equal
     to the  difference  between  50% of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable  and the
     amount,  if any,  actually paid by the non-paying Party to the Escrow Agent
     in respect of the Escrow Agent Receivable.

     6.   (a) The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel of its selection in the
     event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or  construction  of any
     of the  provisions of this  Agreement or its duties  hereunder,  including,
     without  limitation,  the validity of any order of any court or arbitration
     tribunal,  and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully  protected in
     acting  or  refraining  from  acting in  accordance  with the  opinion  and
     instructions of such counsel

          (b) Each of the Parties  acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent
     (i)  shall  not be  deemed  to  have  knowledge  of  the  terms  of,  or be
     responsible  for, any of the  agreements  referred to or  described  herein
     (including,  without limitation,  the Acquisition Agreement,  but excluding
     this  Agreement)  or for  determining  compliance  therewith  and shall not
     otherwise  be bound  thereby  and  (ii)  shall  be  obligated  only for the
     performance of such duties as are  specifically set forth in this Agreement
     on its part to be performed  and no implied  duties or  obligations  of any
     kind shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent.

     7. In the event of any  disagreement  between  any of the  Parties  to this
Agreement,  any  adverse  claims or demands  being made in  connection  with the
subject  matter of the escrow,  or in the event that the Escrow  Agent,  in good
faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder,  the Escrow Agent
may,  at its  option,  refuse to comply  with any claims  and  demands on it and
retain in its possession  without liability to anyone all or any of the property
held by it

<PAGE>

hereunder,  or  refuse  to take  any  other  action  hereunder,  so long as such
disagreement  continues or such doubt exists.  The Escrow Agent shall not become
liable in any way or to any  person  for its  failure  or refusal to act in such
event, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to refrain from acting
until  (i)  the  rights  of all  parties  shall  have  been  fully  and  finally
adjudicated  by a final  order,  decree,  or judgment of a court or  arbitration
tribunal of competent  jurisdiction (and in the case of an arbitration tribunal,
accompanied  by a certificate  signed by an  Appropriate  Officer of KCS and TMM
stating that such arbitration was undertaken in accordance with Section 12.11 or
10.5 of the  Acquisition  Agreement),  accompanied by an opinion of counsel that
such order, decree or judgment is final, or (ii) all differences shall have been
resolved by agreement among all the interested  persons,  and Escrow Agent shall
have been notified  thereof in writing signed by all such persons.  Escrow Agent
shall have the option, after thirty (30) calendar days notice to the Parties, of
its intention to do so, to file an action in interpleader  requiring the Parties
to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The rights of the
Escrow Agent under this  paragraph  are  cumulative of all other rights which it
may have by law or otherwise.

     8. Notice to the Parties shall be given as provided  below.  Whenever under
the terms hereof the time for giving a notice or  performing an act falls upon a
Saturday, a Sunday or a banking holiday in New York, such time shall be extended
to the next day on which the Escrow Agent is open for business.

     9. The Escrow Agent may, in its sole  discretion,  resign and terminate its
position  hereunder  at any time  following  thirty (30)  calendar  days written
notice to the other Parties to the Escrow Agreement. Prior to the effective date
of  resignation  specified  in such notice,  the Parties will jointly  appoint a
successor  escrow agent. On the effective date of such  appointment,  the Escrow
Agent shall  deliver  this Escrow  Agreement  together  with any and all related
instruments or documents and all of the funds,  securities,  documents and other
assets  held in escrow  hereunder  to any  successor  escrow  agent  selected in
writing by Parties to this Agreement.  If a successor  escrow agent has not been
appointed  prior to the  expiration of thirty (30)  calendar days  following the
date  of  notice  of  such  resignation,   then  (i)  the  Escrow  Agent's  sole
responsibility  after that time shall be to safekeep the property held in escrow
by it hereunder  until receipt by it of designation of a successor  escrow agent
and (ii) the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction  for
the appointment of a successor escrow agent, or other  appropriate  relief.  Any
such  resulting  appointment  shall  be  binding  upon all the  Parties  to this
Agreement.

     10. The Parties to this Agreement may by mutual written  agreement,  with a
copy of such agreement  forwarded to the Escrow Agent,  at any time substitute a
new escrow agent by giving ten (10) days notice  thereof to the Escrow Agent and
paying all fees and  expenses  due to the Escrow  Agent.  Any such  substitution
shall terminate all obligations and duties of the Escrow

<PAGE>

Agent hereunder.  On the effective date of such  substitution,  the Escrow Agent
shall deliver this  Agreement  together with any and all related  instruments or
documents and all of the funds,  securities,  documents and other assets held in
escrow  hereunder to a successor  escrow agent that the Parties have selected in
writing.

     11. The Escrow Agent shall  receive the fees provided in Appendix B hereto.
Except as provided in Section  5(b),  the Escrow Agent shall not be permitted to
utilize the Escrow Fund to cover any of its fees or expenses.  TMM and KCS agree
as between  themselves  that all fees and  expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be
paid equally (50% by KCS and 50% by TMM).

     12.  Any  modification  of this  Agreement  or any  additional  obligations
assumed by any party  hereto  shall be binding  only if  evidenced  by a writing
signed  by each of the  parties  hereto.  Upon the  earlier  to occur of (i) the
reduction of the VAT Escrow Note in full principal  amount, or (ii) the delivery
of the VAT Escrow Note to KCS, this Agreement shall be thereupon  terminated and
of no further force or effect;  provided that the provisions of Section 5(b) and
11 (for the period prior to such termination, resignation or substitution) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or substitution of
the Escrow Agent.

     13. This  Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York
in all respects.  The Parties hereto irrevocably and  unconditionally  submit to
the  jurisdiction  of a federal or state court located in New York,  New York in
connection with any proceedings commenced regarding this Agreement including but
not limited to a interpleader proceeding or a proceeding for the employment of a
successor  escrow agent. The Parties  irrevocably  submit to the jurisdiction of
such courts for the  determination  of all issues in such  proceedings,  without
regard  to any  principles  of  conflicts  of laws,  and  irrevocably  waive any
objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

     14. This  Agreement  may be executed in one or more  counterparts,  each of
which  counterpart  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  original  and  all  of  which
counterparts, taken together, shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

     15. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices and other  communications
hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed  given if (a)  delivered  in
person, (b) transmitted by facsimile (with written confirmation),  (c) mailed by
certified or  registered  mail (return  receipt  requested)  (in which case such
notice  shall be  deemed  given on the  third day  after  such  mailing)  or (d)

                    CONSULTING COMPENSATION ESCROW AGREEMENT


     This CONSULTING COMPENSATION ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered
into and  effective as of this 15th day of December,  2004,  by and among KANSAS
CITY SOUTHERN, a Delaware corporation ("KCS") and Jose F. Serrano  International
Business, S.A. de C.V., a a SOCIEDAD ANONIMA DE CAPITAL VARIABLE organized under
the laws of the UMS  organized  under  the laws of the UMS  ("Consulting  Firm")
(collectively,  the "Parties"), and The Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company of New
York (the "Escrow Agent").

     WHEREAS,  the Parties are parties to the Consulting  Agreement  dated as of
the date  hereof by and  between KCS and the  Consulting  Firm (the  "Consulting
Agreement"),  pursuant to which,  among other things,  the Consulting Firm shall
provide to KCS the Consulting Services in exchange for the payment by KCS of the
Annual Fee (defined below); and

     WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5 of the Consulting Agreement, an amount equal
to the total amount of the Annual Fee for each of the years comprising the three
(3) year terms of the Consulting Agreement, which equals, in the aggregate, Nine
Million US Dollars  ($9,000,000),  (as increased by Interest (defined below) and
reduced by Losses  (defined  below) or amounts  released  pursuant  to Section 3
below, the "Escrow Fund") is to be deposited in escrow; and

     WHEREAS,  the Parties desire to appoint the Escrow Agent to hold the Escrow
Fund on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
the Escrow Agent is willing to serve in that capacity.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises and agreements  contained
herein,  and  for  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the Parties, it is hereby agreed
by and among the Parties and the Escrow Agent as follows:

     1. APPOINTMENT AND DEPOSIT INTO ESCROW.

          (a) The Parties  hereby  appoint  the Escrow  Agent to serve as escrow
     agent hereunder. In accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions
     hereof,  the Escrow  Agent  accepts  such  appointment  and agrees to hold,
     invest and distribute the Escrow Fund, in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (b) On the Effective Date of the Consulting Agreement (as that term is
     defined  therein),  KCS will deposit an amount equal to US $9,000,000  with
     the Escrow Agent in a non-interest  bearing escrow  account,  to be held by
     the Escrow Agent and released only pursuant to the terms and  conditions of
     this Escrow Agreement.

          (c) The  Escrow  Fund shall be held for the  exclusive  benefit of the
     Parties,  their  successors and assigns and no other person or entity shall
     have any right,  title or interest  therein,  except as provided in Section
     4(b).

<PAGE>

     2.   (a) The Escrow Fund deposited in escrow hereunder shall be invested by
     the Escrow Agent in accordance  with the written  instructions  provided by
     the Consulting Firm. All interest,  gains,  income and other  distributions
     (collectively,  "Interest")  received on or with respect to the Escrow Fund
     shall be received  for the benefit of the  Consulting  Firm.  All  Interest
     shall  become  part of the  Escrow  Fund and any costs of  investments  and
     losses on such  investments  ("Losses")  shall reduce the Escrow Fund.  The
     parties  agree that,  for tax reporting  purposes,  all Interest and Losses
     shall be reported as allocated to the Consulting Firm.

          (b)  The  Escrow  Agent  shall  have  no  liability  for  any  loss on
     investments  made  pursuant to this  Agreement,  including  any loss on any
     investment  required to be liquidated  prior to maturity in order to make a
     payment  required  hereunder.  Investments  by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
     this  Agreement  shall be subject to  availability.  In no event  shall the
     Escrow Agent be required to provide  investment  advice of any kind. Absent
     its receipt of any written  investment  instructions  from Consulting Firm,
     the Escrow Agent shall have no  obligation or duty to invest any funds held
     by it under this Agreement.

          (c) The  Consulting  Firm agrees that, if necessary,  it shall provide
     the Escrow Agent with a Form W-9 or Form W8-BEN, as the case may be.

          (d) The Escrow Agent is hereby  authorized,  in making or disposing of
     any  investment  permitted by this  Agreement,  to deal with itself (in its
     individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates.

     3. The Escrow Agent shall  release the Escrow Fund and any  Interest  which
becomes part of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the following:

          (a) On the  last  day  of the  month,  or if  such  day  falls  upon a
     Saturday,  a Sunday or a banking holiday in New York, the next day on which
     the Escrow Agent is open for business, following each of the first, second,
     and third  anniversary  hereof  (each  such  one-year  period,  a  "Payment
     Period"),  the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the Consulting Firm an amount
     from the Escrow Fund equal to $3,000,000  (the "Annual Fee"),  (i) plus any
     Interest  received on the Escrow Fund during such Payment Period,  and (ii)
     less  the  amount  of any  Losses  incurred  during  such  Payment  Period;
     provided,  that if the Losses for any Payment  Period  exceed the amount of
     the Annual Fee, no amount shall be  transferred  by the Escrow Agent to the
     Consulting  Firm  for  such  Payment  Period,  and the  Annual  Fee for the
     subsequent  Payment  Period  shall be reduced by the amount such Losses for
     the  previous  Payment  Period  exceeded  the Annual  Fee for such  Payment
     Period.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall not transfer
     any  amount of the  Escrow  Fund to the  Consulting  Firm in  respect of an
     Annual Fee for a Payment Period if the Escrow Agent receives written notice
     (a  "Payment   Determination   Notice")   signed

<PAGE>

     by the President or a  Vice-President  (each, an "Appropriate  Officer") of
     KCS , which Payment  Determination Notice shall be simultaneously copied to
     the  Consulting  Firm stating that the  Consulting  Firm is not entitled to
     payment for services  rendered  during such Payment  Period,  which Payment
     Determination  Notice  shall  be  received  by the  Escrow  Agent  and  the
     Consulting Firm not later than ten (10) Business Days (defined below) prior
     to the  expiration  of such Payment  Period and shall be  accompanied  by a
     certificate  signed  by an  Appropriate  Officer  of KCS  stating  that the
     procedures  for such  determination,  as set forth in  Section  5(b) of the
     Consulting  Agreement,  have been  fully  complied  with (a  "Determination
     Certificate").  As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean a day of
     the year on which national banks in New York, New York, are not required or
     permitted to be closed.

          (c) Fifteen  Business Days following  receipt by the Escrow Agent of a
     Payment  Determination  Notice and Determination  Certificate in accordance
     with  sub-section  3(b) above, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (i) transfer
     to KCS an amount  from the  Escrow  Fund  equal to the  Annual Fee for such
     Payment Period in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Payment
     Determination Notice, and (ii) transfer to the Consulting Firm the Interest
     received by the Escrow Agent on the Escrow Fund during such Payment Period,
     provided,  however,  that in the event that  Consulting  Firm shall dispute
     such  Payment   Determination   Notice  or  Determination   Certificate  by
     delivering  written  notice to the  Escrow  Agent  pursuant  to  Section 15
     hereof,  simultaneously copied to KCS, within ten (10) Business Days of the
     Escrow   Agent's   receipt  of  such   Payment   Determination   Notice  or
     Determination  Certificate,  then no amounts  shall be  transferred  to KCS
     pursuant to this Section 4(c) until such dispute has been finally  resolved
     in accordance with the terms of Section 17 of the Consulting Agreement.

          (d) If the  Consulting  Agreement  is  terminated  prior to the stated
     expiration  date  set  forth  therein  (the  "Expiration  Date"),  then any
     remaining  amounts  held  in  the  Escrow  Fund  as of  the  date  of  such
     termination shall be released as follows:

               (i) After receipt by the Escrow Agent of written notice signed by
          an  Appropriate   Officer  of  KCS  and  Consulting  Firm  (an  "Early
          Termination  Notice")  stating that the Consulting  Agreement has been
          terminated prior to the Expiration Date due to the death or disability
          of Jose F. Serrano Segovia,  the Escrow Agent shall release the amount
          remaining  in the Escrow Fund as of the date of such  termination,  if
          any, to the Consulting  Firm in accordance with the  instructions  set
          forth in the Early Termination Notice.

               (ii) After  receipt by the Escrow  Agent of an Early  Termination
          Notice stating that the Consulting Agreement has been terminated prior
          to the Expiration  Date due to the occurrence of an event set forth in
          Section  8(c)  of  the  Consulting   Agreement  with  respect  to  the
          Consulting  Firm,  which  Early  Termination  Notice  shall  include a
          reasonably  detailed  calculation of the amount owed to the

<PAGE>

          Consulting Firm in  consideration of any Annual Fee or portion thereof
          which has accrued as of the  effective  date of such  termination,  if
          any, the Escrow Agent shall (y)  transfer to the  Consulting  Firm the
          amount set forth in the Early  Termination  Notice,  together with any
          Interest received and not paid by the Escrow Agent as of the effective
          date of such termination, and (z) transfer to KCS the amount remaining
          in the Escrow Fund after such payment to the Consulting Firm.

               (iii) After receipt of an Early  Termination  Notice stating that
          the  Consulting  Agreement has been  terminated  without reason by the
          Consulting  Firm prior to the Expiration Date pursuant to Section 8(d)
          thereof,  or by KCS for Cause  pursuant to Section 8(e) thereof,  then
          the  Escrow  Agent  shall (y)  transfer  to KCS the  principal  amount
          remaining  in  the  Escrow  Fund  as of the  effective  date  of  such
          termination,  and (z)  transfer to the  Consulting  Firm any  Interest
          received and not paid by the Escrow Agent as of the effective  date of
          such termination.

               (iv) After receipt of an Early  Termination  Notice  stating that
          the Consulting  Agreement has been  terminated by the Consulting  Firm
          prior to the Expiration  Date due to a material breach thereof by KCS,
          or has been  terminated by KCS other than for Cause,  the Escrow Agent
          shall  transfer to the  Consulting  Firm the amount  remaining  in the
          Escrow Fund,  including  Interest  received and not paid by the Escrow
          Agent, as of the effective date of such termination.

          (e) The Parties agree that any dispute between the Parties,  including
     but not limited to disputes relating to an Early Termination Notice,  shall
     be settled in accordance with Section 17 of the Consulting Agreement.

     4.   (a) The Escrow Agent may act or refrain  from acting in reliance  upon
     any instructions,  notice, certification,  demand, consent,  authorization,
     receipt,  power of attorney or other  writing  delivered to it by any other
     party and believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine without being required
     to determine the authenticity or validity thereof or the correctness of any
     facts  stated  therein.  The Escrow Agent may act or refrain from acting in
     reliance  upon any signature  believed by it to be genuine,  and may assume
     that any such person has been properly authorized to do so.

          (b) The Parties hereto, jointly and severally,  agree to reimburse the
     Escrow  Agent on demand for,  and to  indemnify  and hold the Escrow  Agent
     harmless against and with respect to, any and all loss,  liability,  damage
     or expense  (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees,
     costs and  disbursements)  that the  Escrow  Agent  may  suffer or incur in
     connection  with  this  Agreement  in  its  performance   hereunder  or  in
     connection herewith,  except to the extent such loss, liability,  damage or
     expense  is  caused  by the  Escrow  Agent's

<PAGE>

     willful  misconduct  or  gross  negligence  as  adjudicated  by a court  of
     competent jurisdiction.  The Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply the
     Escrow Fund held by it in escrow hereunder,  and any proceeds  thereof,  to
     the payment of any amounts owing to it by Consulting  Firm or KCS hereunder
     upon one (1) Business Days' notice to Consulting Firm and KCS.

          (c) As between  themselves,  KCS and the Consulting Firm agree that in
     the event that the Escrow Agent exercises its right to apply funds from the
     Escrow Fund to the payment of any amounts  owing to it  hereunder  ("Escrow
     Agent  Receivable")  as a result of the failure of one of KCS or Consulting
     Firm to make  payment  in full of 50% of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable  in
     accordance  with Section 11 hereof,  such  non-paying  Party shall promptly
     transfer to the account of the other  Party in  accordance  with such other
     Party's instructions in immediately  available funds an amount equal to the
     difference  between 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable and the amount,  if
     any,  actually paid by the non-paying  Party to the Escrow Agent in respect
     of the  Escrow  Agent  Receivable.  In the  event  that  the  Escrow  Agent
     exercises  its right to apply  funds from the Escrow Fund to the payment of
     the Escrow Agent  Receivable  as a result of the failure of both of KCS and
     the  Consulting  Firm to make  payment in full of 50% of the  Escrow  Agent
     Receivable in accordance with Section 11 hereof, each such non-paying Party
     shall  promptly  transfer to the  account of the other Party in  accordance
     with such other Party's  instructions  in  immediately  available  funds an
     amount equal to the difference  between 50% of the Escrow Agent  Receivable
     and the amount, if any, actually paid by the non-paying Party to the Escrow
     Agent in respect of the Escrow Agent Receivable.

     5.   (a) The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel of its selection in the
     event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or  construction  of any
     of the  provisions of this  Agreement or its duties  hereunder,  including,
     without  limitation,  the validity of any order of any court or arbitration
     tribunal,  and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully  protected in
     acting  or  refraining  from  acting in  accordance  with the  opinion  and
     instructions of such counsel.

          (b) Each of the Parties  acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent
     (i)  shall  not be  deemed  to  have  knowledge  of  the  terms  of,  or be
     responsible  for, any of the  agreements  referred to or  described  herein
     (including,  without limitation,  the Acquisition Agreement,  but excluding
     this  Agreement)  or for  determining  compliance  therewith  and shall not
     otherwise  be bound  thereby  and  (ii)  shall  be  obligated  only for the
     performance of such duties as are  specifically set forth in this Agreement
     on its part to be performed  and no implied  duties or  obligations  of any
     kind shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent.

     6. In the event of any  disagreement  between  any of the  Parties  to this
Agreement,  any  adverse  claims or demands  being made in  connection  with the
subject  matter of the escrow,  or in the event that the Escrow  Agent,  in good
faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder,  the Escrow Agent
may, at its sole option,  refuse to comply with any claims and demands on it and
retain in its possession  without liability to anyone all or any of the property

<PAGE>

held by it hereunder,  or refuse to take any other action hereunder,  so long as
such  disagreement  continues or such doubt  exists.  The Escrow Agent shall not
become  liable in any way or to any person for its  failure or refusal to act in
such event,  and the Escrow  Agent shall be entitled to continue to refrain from
acting  until (i) the rights of all  parties  shall have been fully and  finally
adjudicated  by a final  order,  decree,  or judgment of a court or  arbitration
tribunal of competent  jurisdiction (and in the case of an arbitration tribunal,
accompanied  by a  certificate  signed  by an  Appropriate  Officer  of KCS  and
Consulting Firm stating that such  arbitration was undertaken in accordance with
Section 17 of the  Consulting  Agreement),  accompanied by an opinion of counsel
that such order, decree or judgment is final, or (ii) all differences shall have
been resolved by agreement  among all the interested  persons,  and Escrow Agent
shall have been notified  thereof in writing signed by all such persons.  Escrow
Agent  shall have the option,  after  thirty  (30)  calendar  days notice to the
Parties, of its intention to do so, to file an action in interpleader  requiring
the Parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among  themselves.  The
rights of the Escrow  Agent under this  paragraph  are  cumulative  of all other
rights which it may have by law or otherwise.  Notwithstanding  any provision to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no case shall the Escrow Agent be required or
obligated to distribute any property held in escrow by it hereunder  sooner than
two (2)  Business  Days  after  it has  received  instructions  to do so and the
applicable documents required under this Agreement.

     7.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement,  in no
case shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligate to  distribute  any property
held in escrow by it hereunder  sooner than two (2)  Business  Days after it has
received  instructions to do so and the applicable documents required under this
Agreement.

     8. Notice to the Parties shall be given as provided  below.  Whenever under
the terms hereof the time for giving a notice or  performing an act falls upon a
Saturday, a Sunday or a banking holiday in New York, such time shall be extended
to the next day on which the Escrow Agent is open for business.

     9. The Escrow Agent may, in its sole  discretion,  resign and terminate its
position  hereunder  at any time  following  thirty (30)  calendar  days written
notice to the other Parties to the Escrow Agreement. Prior to the effective date
of  resignation  specified  in such notice,  the Parties will jointly  appoint a
successor  escrow agent. On the effective date of such  appointment,  the Escrow
Agent shall  deliver  this Escrow  Agreement  together  with any and all related
instruments or documents and all of the funds,  securities,  documents and other
assets  held in escrow  hereunder  to any  successor  escrow  agent  selected in
writing by Parties to this Agreement.  If a successor  escrow agent has not been
appointed  prior to the  expiration of thirty (30)  calendar days  following the
date  of  notice  of  such  resignation,   then  (i)  the  Escrow  Agent's  sole
responsibility  after that time shall be to safekeep the property held in escrow
by it hereunder  until receipt by it of designation of a successor  escrow agent
and (ii) the Escrow Agent may petition any court of

<PAGE>

competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent, or other
appropriate relief. Any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all the
Parties to this Agreement.

     10. The Parties to this Agreement may by mutual written  agreement,  with a
copy of such agreement  forwarded to the Escrow Agent,  at any time substitute a
new escrow agent by giving ten (10) days notice  thereof to the Escrow Agent and
paying all fees and  expenses  due to the Escrow  Agent.  Any such  substitution
shall terminate all obligations and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. On the
effective  date of such  substitution,  the  Escrow  Agent  shall  deliver  this
Agreement together with any and all related  instruments or documents and all of
the funds, securities,  documents and other assets held in escrow hereunder to a
successor escrow agent that the Parties have selected in writing.

     11. The Escrow Agent shall  receive the fees provided in Appendix B hereto.
Except as provided in Section  4(b),  the Escrow Agent shall not be permitted to
utilize the Escrow  Fund to cover any of its fees or  expenses.  The  Consulting
Firm and KCS  agree as  between  themselves  that all fees and  expenses  of the
Escrow Agent shall be paid equally (50% by KCS and 50% by the Consulting Firm).

     12.  Any  modification  of this  Agreement  or any  additional  obligations
assumed by any party  hereto  shall be binding  only if  evidenced  by a writing
signed by each of the parties  hereto.  Upon  distribution in full of the Escrow
Fund  and all  Interest  earned  thereon,  this  Agreement  shall  be  thereupon
terminated  and of no further force or effect;  provided that the  provisions of
Sections 4(b) and 11 (for the period prior to such  termination,  resignation or
substitution)   shall  survive  the   termination  of  this  Agreement  and  the
resignation or substitution of the Escrow Agent.

     13. This  Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York
in all respects.  The Parties hereto irrevocably and  unconditionally  submit to
the  jurisdiction  of a federal or state court located in New York,  New York in
connection with any proceedings commenced regarding this Agreement including but
not limited to a interpleader proceeding or a proceeding for the employment of a
successor  escrow agent. The Parties  irrevocably  submit to the jurisdiction of
such courts for the  determination  of all issues in such  proceedings,  without
regard  to any  principles  of  conflicts  of laws,  and  irrevocably  waive any
objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

     14. This  Agreement  may be executed in one or more  counterparts,  each of
which  counterpart  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  original  and  all  of  which
counterparts, taken together, shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

     15. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices and other  communications
hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed  given if (a)  delivered  in

AGREEMENT OF ASSIGNMENT  AND  ASSUMPTION OF RIGHTS,  AND AGENCY  AGREEMENT  WITH
UNDISCLOSED  PRINCIPAL,  DUTIES AND  OBLIGATIONS,  DATED AS OF December 15, 2004

AMONG THE FOLLOWING PARTIES:

I.   Grupo TMM, S.A., a SOCIEDAD ANONIMA  organized under the laws of the United
     Mexican  States  ("GTMM"),  as  successor  in  interest  to  Transportacion
     Maritima  Mexicana,  S.A. de C.V.,  represented in this act by its Chairman
     and  attorney-in-fact  Ing. Jose Francisco  Serrano Segovia and its CEO and
     attorney-in-fact Lic. Javier Segovia Serrano;

II.  Kansas City Southern, a Delaware  corporation ("KCS"),  represented in this
     act by its Chairman, President and CEO, Mr. Michael R. Haverty; and

III. Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., a SOCIEDAD ANONIMA
     DE CAPITAL  VARIABLE  organized under the laws of the United Mexican States
     ("GTFM"), formerly known as Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S. de R.L.
     de C. V., represented in this act by Lic. Mario Mohar Ponce and Mr. Michael
     R. Haverty.

In  consideration  of  and  in  conformity  with  the  following   recitals  and
agreements:



RECITALS

1.   On January 31, 1997,  the Federal  Government of the United  Mexican States
     (the  "GOVERNMENT")  and GTFM  entered  into an  agreement  (the  "PURCHASE
     AGREEMENT") for the purchase of 80% of the capital stock of the Ferrocarril
     del Noreste, S.A. de C.V., currently known as TFM, S.A. de C.V. ("TFM");

2.   Pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreement,  the  Government  retained 20% of the
     capital stock of TFM,  represented by Class III limited voting shares, with
     the Government  retaining the option under the Purchase Agreement to all or
     a portion of those shares to the public,  and in accordance  with the terms
     of the  Purchase  Agreement to sell any shares not sold to the public prior
     to the date fixed in the Purchase  Agreement to GTFM at a price  determined
     by the formula stated in the Purchase Agreement (the "PUT Shares");

3.   On June 9,  1997,  the  Government,  GTFM,  GTMM  and KCS  entered  into an
     amendment of the Purchase  Agreement  (hereinafter,  the "PUT  AGREEMENT"),
     through which,  among other  matters,  the term during which the Government
     may sell the Put Shares to the public and  require  GTFM to acquire the Put
     Shares was extended, and GTMM and KCS jointly and severally agreed with the
     Government in Section 3.02 of the Put Agreement that in the event that GTFM
     did not  acquire  the Put  Shares in  accordance  with the terms of the Put
     Agreement, GTMM and KCS would be jointly and severally obligated to acquire
     the Put Shares;

<PAGE>

4.   In  May  1997,   GTMM  and  KCS,  and  certain  of  their   affiliates  and
     subsidiaries,   entered  into  a  Shareholders   Agreement   ("SHAREHOLDERS
     AGREEMENT")   that   included,   among   other   provisions,   Section   7,
     Indemnification,   which  created   rights,   duties  and   obligations  of
     indemnification between GTMM and KCS with respect to the Put Shares;

5.   On October 31, 2003, the Ministry of Communications and Transportation (the
     "SCT")  purported  through  official  letter  4.620  to  notify  TFM of the
     existence of the  obligation to purchase the Put Shares,  and GTFM, TMM and
     KCS were advised of that purported notification;

6.   As GTFM  and  TFM  believe  that  the  Government  has  not  satisfied  its
     obligations  under the Purchase  Agreement and the Put Agreement,  and that
     the purported  notification by the SCT of TFM of the obligation to purchase
     the Put Shares was  defective,  GTFM and TFM filed on  October  16,  2003 a
     lawsuit, case number 166/2003-V (the "PUT LAWSUIT"), naming the Treasury of
     the Mexican Federation, the SCT, the General Attorney of the United Mexican
     States as  necessary  parties,  and  seeking a judicial  interpretation  of
     GTFM's  and TFM's  obligations  under the  Purchase  Agreement  and the Put
     Agreement.  TMM and KCS,  among  others,  were called to the Put Lawsuit as
     interested third parties;

7.   GTFM and TFM filed on November 26, 2003 a  constitutional  appeal  (AMPARO,
     the  "AMPARO"),  case  number  1628/2003,   against  the  Treasury  of  the
     Federation,  the SCT, and the General Attorney of the United Mexican States
     with respect to official  letter 4.620 of October 31, 2003,  which resulted
     in an injunction being issued against the defendants;

8.   The  Government  has  indicated  that it may  file  additional  proceedings
     against  GTFM,  TFM,  GTMM and KCS related to the Put Agreement and the VAT
     Claim;

9.   GTMM and KCS  have  entered  into  the  Amended  and  Restated  Acquisition
     Agreement by and among KCS, KARA Sub,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation,  GTMM
     and certain other parties (the "ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"); and

10.  Pursuant to the Acquisition  Agreement,  the Shareholders Agreement and all
     rights,  duties and obligations  arising from the  Shareholders  Agreement,
     including  Section 7 thereof,  shall  terminate  and shall be of no further
     force  and  effect  as of  the  Closing  (as  defined  in  the  Acquisition
     Agreement).

AGREEMENTS

For good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency  of which is
hereby acknowledged,  the parties hereto,  intending to be legally bound hereby,
agree as follows:

1)   ASSIGNMENT  AND  ASSUMPTION  OF PUT  OBLIGATION.  GTMM  hereby  irrevocably
     assigns  and  transfers  to KCS,  and KCS hereby  irrevocably  accepts  and
     assumes,  all of GTMM's rights,  duties and obligations with respect to the
     purchase  of the Put Shares  under the Put  Agreement,  effective  upon the
     Closing of the Acquisition.

<PAGE>

2)   PURCHASE RIGHT. In the event that following Closing of the Acquisition GTFM
     or GTMM are required to purchase the Put Shares held by the  Government (or
     any person to which the Government delegates, transfers or assigns any such
     Put Shares and/or the Put Option),  including upon final determination that
     either of them is required to purchase  the Put Shares  pursuant to the Put
     Agreement, KCS or its designee shall purchase, in accordance with the terms
     of the Put  Agreement  all of the Put  Shares  that  GTMM  would  have been
     required to purchase  pursuant  to the Put  Agreement..  KCS shall have the
     right to cause any KCS  subsidiary  to  purchase  the Put  Shares or it may
     designate another party to be the purchaser of the Put Shares,  but no such
     designation  shall relieve KCS of its  obligation to pay the purchase price
     for such Put Shares or to indemnify any person under Section 5 hereof.

3)   PAYMENT  OF  PURCHASE  PRICE;  NON-ASSIGNABLE   OBLIGATIONS;   AGENCY  WITH
     UNDISCLOSED  PRINCIPAL  AGREEMENT.  In the event that,  notwithstanding the
     provisions of Section 2, GTMM is legally required  following Closing of the
     Acquisition  to purchase  the Put Shares then KCS shall  provide  GTMM with
     immediately  available  funds  sufficient to purchase the Put Shares and to
     pay all costs and expenses  associated  with such purchase  (including  any
     taxes that may become  payable in connection  with such purchase) not later
     than three (3) business days prior to the date of such  purchase,  and GTMM
     shall  purchase  such Put  Shares on  behalf  of KCS,  but in its own name,
     pursuant to Articles  2560 and 2561 of the Federal Civil Code of the United
     Mexican States.  Transfer of such amount shall not affect KCS'  obligations
     under  Section 6 of this  Agreement.  Once GTMM  acquires the PUT Shares on
     behalf  of KCS,  but in its own  name,  it  shall  immediately  endorse  in
     property the relevant certificates in favor of KCS or its designee.

     Pursuant to Article  2596 of the Federal  Civil Code of the United  Mexican
     States,  GTMM hereby  irrevocably  agrees not to renounce  the  obligations
     assumed in this  Section 3, to act as  undisclosed  agent  (MANDATARIO  SIN
     REPRESENTACION) of KCS.



4)   CONTROL AND  MANAGEMENT  OF  LITIGATION.  Following  the Closing  under the
     Acquisition  Agreement,  KCS  shall  have the sole and  exclusive  right to
     control  any and all  litigation  related to the Put  Agreement,  including
     without limitation the Put Lawsuit and the Amparo. For such purposes,  GTMM
     hereby  agrees to grant,  within 10 (ten)  business  days after the Closing
     under the Acquisition Agreement,  an irrevocable power of attorney in favor
     of KCS for lawsuits and  collections  (PLEITOS Y COBRANZAS)  limited to (i)
     the Put Lawsuit,  (ii) the Amparo,  in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit
     "A",  and (iii) and any other  litigation  related to or derived  from this
     litigation.



5)   INDEMNIFICATION.  KCS shall following Closing of the Acquisition indemnify,
     defend and hold  harmless  GTMM and its  Affiliates,  and their  respective
     officers, directors,  employees and shareholders,  from and against any and
     all   losses,   damages,   liabilities,   claims,   demands,   obligations,
     deficiencies,  payments, judgments,  settlements,

<PAGE>

     costs  and  expenses  of any  nature  whatsoever  (including  the costs and
     expenses  of any  and  all  investigations,  actions,  suits,  proceedings,
     demands,  assessments,   judgments,  orders,  settlements  and  compromises
     relating thereto),  and reasonable attorneys',  accountants',  experts' and
     other fees and expenses in connection  therewith ("LOSSES") resulting from,
     arising  out of or due  directly  to KCS'  failure to fully  discharge  the
     obligations  of GTMM and KCS under the Put  Agreement,  including,  without
     limitation, KCS' failure to purchase, when required by the Government to do
     so in accordance with the Put Agreement,  the Put Shares or any requirement
     to fund amounts to GTFM to permit GTFM to purchase the Put Shares; provided
     that KCS may set off against  and reduce the amount of any  indemnification
     obligation  under  this  paragraph  by the  amount  of any  indemnification
     obligation  of GTMM  pursuant to Article 10 of the  Acquisition  Agreement,
     except  with  respect  to any  indemnification  obligations  of GTFM  under
     Sections 10.2(a)(i) or (a)(ii), which amounts may not be offset.

6)   REMEDIES.  Subject to the provisions contemplated in this Agreement: (a) in
     the event  that one  party  materially  fails to  perform  its  obligations
     pursuant  to  this  Agreement,  the  other  party  may  bring  any  action,
     proceeding  or  court  action  seeking  (i)  specific  performance  of  the
     obligations  of the party in default  hereunder,  which the parties  hereto
     agree shall be available to the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, (ii)
     damages  as a result  of any  such  failure  to  perform  pursuant  to this
     Agreement,  with the parties  hereto  agreeing  that damages to the damaged
     party arising as a result of any material  breach by the part in default of
     its obligations  hereunder shall be recoverable by them in any such action,
     and/or (iii) any other remedy  available  under  applicable law; and (b) to
     the extent  permitted  by  applicable  law,  all of the  remedies set forth
     herein  and  or  the  Acquisition  Agreement  or at law  shall  be  equally
     available to each of the parties hereto.

7)   NOTIFICATION. GTMM shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify
     KCS of any  notifications  given  to  GTMM  under  or  concerning  the  Put
     Agreement.

8)   INCORPORATION  OF PARTS OF THE  AGREEMENT.  Article  12 of the  Acquisition
     Agreement is hereby  incorporated  MUTATIS MUTANDIS into and made a part of
     this  Agreement.  Defined terms used in this Agreement not defined  herein,
     shall  have  the  meanings  ascribed  to  those  terms  in the  Acquisition
     Agreement.

IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Parties  have caused this  Agreement to be executed by
their authorized representatives of the date first above written.

                     THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF KCS AND TMM
                      APPROVE AMENDED ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

Kansas  City,  MO and Mexico  City,  Mexico,  December  15,  2004 - Kansas  City
Southern  (NYSE:  KSU) ("KCS") and Grupo TMM,  S.A.  (NYSE:  TMM and BMV: TMM A)
("TMM")  announced  today  that  the  companies  have  entered  into an  amended
acquisition  agreement  whereby TMM will sell its 51 percent voting  interest in
Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. ("Grupo TFM") to KCS for
$200 million in cash, 18 million  shares of KCS common  stock,  $47 million in a
two-year  promissory  note,  and up to $110 million  payable in a combination of
cash and KCS common stock upon successful  resolution of the current proceedings
related  to the VAT  Claim  and the Put with  the  Mexican  Government.  The $47
million  promissory  note and a portion of the $110 million  contingent  payment
will  be  subject   to   certain   escrow   arrangements   to  cover   potential
indemnification  claims. The boards of directors of both companies have approved
the transaction.

As part of the  transaction,  KCS will also enter into a  three-year  consulting
contract with a consulting firm controlled by Jose Serrano Segovia.  KCS and TMM
have also agreed that upon completion of the transaction all litigation  between
the two companies will be dismissed.

Consummation of the transaction  remains subject to the  satisfaction of certain
conditions,  including KCS shareholder approval.  TMM's controlling shareholders
have entered into a voting trust providing for approval of the transaction.

Both  the  Mexican  Foreign  Investment   Commission  and  the  Mexican  Federal
Competition  Commission have approved acquisition of the controlling interest in
TFM by KCS.  Although KCS and TMM previously  satisfied the  requirements of the
U.S.  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements Act of 1976, that authorization
has  expired  and the  parties  have  agreed  to file the  required  information
promptly with the U.S.  Department of Justice.  This  authorization  is required
prior to consummation of the transaction.

"We are very pleased to have entered into this amended  agreement  with TMM, and
believe it will enhance rail  competition  and give  shippers in the NAFTA trade
corridor a strong transportation alternative in this important and growing trade
corridor,"  said Michael R. Haverty,  chairman,  president  and chief  executive
officer of KCS. "This  transaction,  along with our recently approved control of
The Texas Mexican Railway Company, offers our shareholders greater value through
operating  efficiencies and  opportunities  that will come from common ownership
and control.  Our  customers,  both north and south of the border,  will benefit
from these efficiencies as well."

Jose Serrano, chairman and CEO of TMM said, "We're very pleased with the outcome
of the  transaction.  It creates  significant  value for all  shareholders.  The
combination of KCS and TFM creates an efficient  shipping route between the U.S.
and Mexico. TMM shareholders will continue to benefit from significant ownership
in this valuable  franchise.  The net cash proceeds of this  transaction will be
used by TMM to reduce its debt  obligations.  This  transaction  is truly in the
best  interests  of TMM  shareholders  and will  ensure  long  term  growth  and
flexibility at TMM."

Javier  Segovia,  president of TMM said,  "We are extremely  pleased to become a
significant  shareholder in KCS, a strong rail alternative  between the U.S. and
Mexico. TMM and TFM will continue to work closely,  and they have entered into a
marketing  agreement  to  further  our  shared  goals  of  providing  end-to-end
transportation for our customers.  In addition,  the sale of TFM to KCS puts TMM
on a superior financial footing".

TFM, S.A. de C.V., the operating subsidiary of Grupo TFM, and KCSR will continue
as  separate  corporations,  all  under the  common  control  of KCS.  Following
consummation of the transaction, KCS will continue to operate under the KCS name
and will maintain its headquarters in Kansas City,  Missouri.  Grupo TFM and TFM
will remain Mexican corporations,  with their corporate  headquarters located in
Mexico City. TFM holds the concession to operate  Mexico's  Northeast Rail Lines
through June 2047, and has the option to extend the concession for an additional
50 years.  The TFM rail  network  consists  of more than 2,600 miles of mainline
track. The combined system will exceed 5,300 miles of mainline track.
