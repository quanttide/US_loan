Item 3.02  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

     On December 27, 2004,  we issued an aggregate of  74,000,000  shares of our
"restricted"  common  stock to three (3)  persons  or  entities,  including  (i)
50,000,000  shares  issued to a  non-affiliate  of our  Company (as that term is
defined  under  Regulation  D, Rule 501,  under the  Securities  Act of 1933, as
amended) for aggregate consideration of $15,000, (ii) 9,000,000 common shares to
another  non-affiliate  pursuant  to  anti-dilution  provisions  included  in  a
previously executed agreement, and (iii) 15,000,000 to Ike Sutton, our President
and Chief Executive Officer,  who converted $45,000 in debt which we owed to him
in consideration  for the shares. We relied upon the exemption from registration
afforded by Regulation D and Section 4/2, as applicable,  promulgated  under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to issue these securities.

Item 4.01  Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

     Effective  December 30, 2004, the firm of HJ and Associates LLC ("HJ"), our
independent accountant during the period from May 24, 2004 to December 30, 2004,
resigned.  HJ did  not  audit  our  financial  statements,  but did  review  our
quarterly reports for the previous two fiscal quarters.

     Through the date of this Report, there were no disagreements with HJ on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing  scope of  procedures,  which  disagreements,  if not  resolved  to the
satisfaction  of HJ, would have caused them to make reference in connection with
its reports to the subject matter of the disagreements.

     We  have  requested  that HJ  furnish  us with a  letter  addressed  to the
Commission  stating whether it agrees with the above statements.  A copy of such
letter, dated December 30, 2004, is filed as Exhibit 16.2 to this Form 8-K.

     As of the date of this  report,  we have  not  retained  a new  independent
accounting  firm to audit our  financial  statement  for our fiscal  year ending
December 31, 2004. We undertake to file an amendment to this Form 8-K,  advising
when we retain a new independent accountant.

Item 9.01.  Exhibits.
