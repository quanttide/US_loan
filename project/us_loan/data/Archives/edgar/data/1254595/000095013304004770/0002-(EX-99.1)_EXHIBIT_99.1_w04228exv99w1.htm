<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">FIRST POTOMAC REALTY TRUST ACQUIRES


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NORTHERN VIRGINIA FLEX PROPERTY FOR $15.25 MILLION


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Provides Value-Added Opportunity in Improving Submarket</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BETHESDA, Md. &#151; (December&nbsp;22, 2004) &#151; First Potomac Realty Trust (NYSE:FPO), a real estate
investment trust that acquires and operates industrial and flex properties in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area and other major markets in Virginia and Maryland, announced today that it has
acquired Windsor at Battlefield, a two-building, 154,226-square-foot flex property in Manassas,
Virginia, for $15.25&nbsp;million in cash.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Windsor at Battlefield is situated on approximately 12.3 acres in the Battlefield Business Park in
the Manassas/I-66 Corridor. The property is currently 57% leased to three tenants. Based on
leases in place, the property is expected to generate a first year cash return of approximately
5.1% on the purchase price. The purchase was funded with borrowings on the Company&#146;s revolving
credit facility.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Commenting on the announcement, Nicholas R. Smith, First Potomac&#146;s chief investment officer,
stated, &#147;At only 57% leased, Windsor at Battlefield provides us with an excellent opportunity to
add value. Occupancy rates and market rents in the Manassas/I-66 submarket are increasing and
positive net absorption is trending upward. This bodes well for the property&#146;s 66,000 square feet
of vacant space, which is one of the largest blocks of available flex space in Northern Virginia.
The property&#146;s close proximity to four of our other properties presents us with an attractive
opportunity to leverage off the strong occupancy in our current portfolio, which currently exceeds
95%.&#148;
