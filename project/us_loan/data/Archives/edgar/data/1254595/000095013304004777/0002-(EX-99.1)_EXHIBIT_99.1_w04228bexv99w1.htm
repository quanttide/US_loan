<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">FIRST POTOMAC REALTY TRUST COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF TWO SUBURBAN MARYLAND PROPERTIES



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Company Completes $272 Million in Acquisitions in 2004</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BETHESDA, Md. &#151; (December&nbsp;28, 2004) &#151; First Potomac Realty Trust (NYSE:FPO), a real estate
investment trust that acquires and operates industrial and flex properties in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area and other major markets in Virginia and Maryland, has completed the previously
announced acquisition of the Campus at Metro Park North and 4612 Navistar Drive in suburban
Maryland for $63&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Campus at Metro Park North in Rockville, Maryland, is a four-building flex property built in
2001 totaling approximately 190,000 square feet. 4612 Navistar Drive is a one-building industrial
property built in 1998 totaling approximately 215,000 square feet. The Navistar Drive property is
located in Frederick, Maryland, directly across the street from the Company&#146;s property at 6900
English Muffin Way and includes additional land that can accommodate another building of
approximately 50,000 square feet. Both properties are currently 100% occupied and are expected to
generate a first-year cash return of approximately 8.1% on the purchase price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition was financed by the assumption of two separate first mortgages totaling
approximately $37&nbsp;million and borrowings under the Company&#146;s unsecured credit facility. The
weighted average interest rate on the mortgages that were assumed is 7.24%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Commenting on the announcement, Douglas J. Donatelli, First Potomac&#146;s chief executive officer,
stated, &#147;Metro Park North and Navistar Drive allow us to expand our presence in suburban Maryland.
Both properties are in growing markets near other properties in our portfolio. The properties have
strong tenancy and were recently constructed, and we expect them to generate solid returns over
both the short and long term. They also further solidify our already strong portfolio, which is
more than 95% leased, and will allow us to focus on more opportunistic acquisitions in 2005.&#148;
