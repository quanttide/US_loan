Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
- -----------------------------------------------------

On December 16, 2004, TransAct Technologies Incorporated ("TransAct") entered
into a supply, sales and license agreement with IGT, a subsidiary of
International Game Technology ("IGT").  Under the terms of the agreement, IGT
granted TransAct a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
incorporate IGT's Netplex protocol (which provides the ability for communication
between peripheral devices that incorporate Netplex and IGT gaming machines)
into certain TransAct thermal printers so that they may be sold for use with IGT
gaming machines.  The agreement also calls for IGT to integrate TransAct's Epic
950/TM/ into all currently supported IGT gaming machine platforms and to
ultimately obtain regulatory approvals in all jurisdictions where IGT
distributes gaming machines with ticket printing capabilities.  TransAct expects
to incur approximately $500,000 of costs related to such integration.  In
addition, the agreement provides that IGT shall make TransAct's Epic 950/TM/
printer available as a standard option on all IGT gaming machine platforms.

The agreement shall continue for three years beginning upon the receipt of
certain jurisdictional and gaming board approvals. The agreement shall
automatically renew for additional one year periods unless terminated by either
party in writing at least thirty days prior to the end of the initial term or
the then-current renewal term.
