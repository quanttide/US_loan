ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement and
ITEM 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On December 23, 2004 Presidential Realty Corporation ("Presidential" or the
"Company") made a $7,500,000 mezzanine loan (the "Loan") to an affiliate of The
Lightstone Group ("Lightstone"). The Loan is secured by the ownership interests
in the entities owning the Brazos Mall, an enclosed single story regional mall
located in Lake Jackson, Texas with 697,678 square feet of rentable area, and
the Shawnee Mall, an enclosed single story regional mall located in Shawnee,
Oklahoma with 445,657 square feet of rentable area (the "Properties"). The Loan
has a term of 10 years, bears interest at the rate of 11% per annum and is
prepayable (along with a 3% exit fee) upon repayment of the first mortgage
covering the Properties or certain changes of control of Presidential.

The borrower is not personally liable for repayment of the Loan except for
losses resulting from certain enumerated fraudulent acts. In connection with the
Loan, Presidential obtained a 29% economic interest in the companies owning the
Properties.

The Properties are subject to a first mortgage loan from Wachovia Bank, National
Association in the original principal amount of $39,500,000. The Wachovia loan
is due on January 9, 2007, but may be extended at the borrowers' option for
three additional one-year periods. The Wachovia note bears interest at a
fluctuating rate equal to 280 basis points over the 30-day LIBOR rate, which
interest rate is currently 5.16%. In connection with the transaction, the
borrower was required to purchase an interest rate cap so that the interest rate
cannot exceed 8.8% per annum. The Wachovia note is not prepayable.

Over the past five years, Presidential has made six other loans in the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of approximately $19,913,000 to entities that are
controlled by David Lichtenstein, the principal of Lightstone, including
$10,038,410 made in September of 2004 relating to five other regional shopping
mall properties. In connection with the most recent loan, Lightstone repaid
$3,000,000 of principal amount of an existing loan secured by certain apartment
properties. All of the loans outstanding from Lightstone are in good standing as
of the date hereof.

ITEM 9.01         Financial Statements and Exhibits

    required by Item 9.01 and applicable regulations with respect to the
    transaction described in Item 2.01, they will be filed by an Amendment

(c) Exhibits. Company's Press Release dated December 27, 2004 .
