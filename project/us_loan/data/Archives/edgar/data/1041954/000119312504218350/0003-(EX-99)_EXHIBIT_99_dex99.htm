southeastern United States, today announced the mutual termination of its merger agreement with Florida Digital Network, Inc., d/b/a FDN Communications, Inc. (FDN), that was announced on September 8, 2004. No termination fees are payable by either
company, and each company will bear its own merger-related expenses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">&#147;While we are disappointed that we are unable to move forward with the transaction, we believe this mutual termination is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers and employees,&#148; said Larry Williams, ITC^DeltaCom
Chairman and CEO. &#147;We will continue to focus on the successful execution of our operating plan.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On September 8, 2004, ITC^DeltaCom also entered into a merger agreement with NT Corporation, d/b/a Network Telephone. Under that agreement, the completion of ITC^DeltaCom&#146;s merger with FDN is a condition to
ITC^DeltaCom&#146;s obligation to complete its merger with Network Telephone. The prior completion of the FDN merger is also a requirement of the consent by ITC^DeltaCom&#146;s lenders to ITC^DeltaCom&#146;s merger with Network Telephone.
Accordingly, as a result of its mutual termination agreement with FDN, ITC^DeltaCom will not proceed with the proposed Network Telephone transaction. ITC^DeltaCom and Network Telephone are currently in discussions seeking to achieve a mutual
termination of their agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><U>ABOUT ITC^DELTACOM, INC. </U>
