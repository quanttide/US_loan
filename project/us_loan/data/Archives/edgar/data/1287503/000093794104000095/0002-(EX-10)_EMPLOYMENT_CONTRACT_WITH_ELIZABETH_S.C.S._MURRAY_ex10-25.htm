As compensation for Employee&#146;s services, the Company will pay to Employee an annual base salary in the gross amount of $235,000 (the &#147;Base Salary&#148;), payable in accordance with the Company&#146;s regularly established payroll practices, which payroll practices may be modified from time to time by the Company in its discretion. The Company will no less than annually review Employee&#146;s Base Salary, which may be modified upon approval by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors in its discretion, and as may be necessary in relation to other similarly-situated employees. </FONT></P>

<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size=2>3.2&nbsp; <U>Annual Bonus</U>. Employee will be eligible to earn an annual bonus in an amount equal to 50% of Employee&#146;s Base Salary, which will be paid in accordance with the Company&#146;s existing, or to be established, annual bonus plan or program.&nbsp; The Company represents to Employee that its annual bonus plan or program will be finalized and adopted by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors prior to the end of Employee&#146;s first six months of employment with the Company, and that such bonus plan or program will apply to Employee&#146;s efforts on behalf of the Company as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Company&#146;s annual bonus plan or program will be subject to change from time to time by the Company in its sole discretion, provided, however, that: (i) in no event will the bonus plan or program be modified so as to prevent Employee from being eligible to earn an annual bonus

The Option shall vest in equal quarterly installments over a four-year period immediately following the grant. The option agreement will provide for partial acceleration of vesting in the event of a Corporate Transaction involving the Company (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) as follows: vesting will accelerate so that those shares that would have vested within twelve (12) months after the date of the Corporate Transaction will be deemed to be vested and exercisable immediately prior to the specified
effective date of such Corporate Transaction, provided that the Employee&#146;s employment has not terminated prior to such date. Vesting will not accelerate if the Option is assumed by the successor entity or replaced with a comparable cash incentive program, unless Employee&#146;s employment is terminated within 12 months after the Corporate Transaction by the successor without Cause, in which event, the deemed vesting will be given effect and the affected shares shall be deemed exercisable and salable under the terms of the Plan, and if such events are no longer possible due to changed circumstances, the survivor in the Corporate Transaction will be required to provide the economic benefit otherwise available to Employee. Employee agrees that she will not exercise the Option, even if vested, until the earlier of (i) the day following the consummation of the spin-off the Company&#146;s common stock by PC Mall, Inc. or (ii) 18 months from the closing date of the Company&#146;s initial public
offering. Vesting of Employee&#146;s Option will be subject to Employee&#146;s continued employment by the Company. The Option shall expire 90 days after Employee&#146;s termination of employment with the Company for any reason. Employee&#146;s entitlement to the Option is conditioned upon the execution by Employee and the Company of a stock option agreement and shall be subject to its terms and the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan. </FONT></P>

</blockquote>

<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size=2>6.6&nbsp; <U>Injunctions</U>.
