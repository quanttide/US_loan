<P>Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</P></B>
<P>On December 22, 2004, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the "Company")
entered into an amendment and restatement of its existing unsecured revolving
and term credit facilities. Bank of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. serve as Joint Lead Arrangers, Bank of America, N.A. serves as
Administrative Agent, Citicorp North America, Inc. and Commerzbank AG serve as
Syndication Agents and Societe Generale and Eurohypo AG serve as Documentation
Agents.</P>
<P>The maximum permitted borrowings under the unsecured revolving and term
credit facilities have been increased to $500 million and $250 million,
respectively. The Company may in the future elect to increase commitments under
the unsecured revolving credit facility by up to an additional $100 million.</P>
<P>The unsecured revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 2007,
which may be extended, at the Company's sole option, for an additional one year
period. The unsecured term loan has a maturity date of December 2009. Borrowings
under both credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate based on the
Company's election of either a Eurodollar based rate, or the higher of the
bank's reference rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%. Under the amended and
restated credit facilities, applicable margins on Eurodollar based rate loans,
which are based on the Company's debt rating or leverage ratio, have been
reduced. For each Eurodollar based advance, the Company must elect a Eurodollar
period of one, two, three or six months.</P>
<P>These credit facilities contain financial covenants including, among other
things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross asset
value ratio, and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the
credit facilities restrict, among other things, certain investments,
indebtedness, distributions and mergers. Aggregate borrowings under the credit
facilities may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived
from a pool of unencumbered properties. These credit facilities contain
customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that
remains uncured, the outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities may be
accelerated and become due and payable immediately. </P>
<P>A copy of the Company's press release regarding the amendment and restatement
of the credit facilities is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1.</P><B>
