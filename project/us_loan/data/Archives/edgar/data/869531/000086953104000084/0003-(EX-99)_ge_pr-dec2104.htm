<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH--(PR NEWSWIRE)--December 21, 2004---Golden Eagle announced today that it has reached agreement
          in principal for the full and final payoff of its $1 million note to Frost Bank
          of Houston, Texas prior to its maturity date of December 29, 2004. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two
trusts, which have been long-term shareholders in Golden Eagle, have agreed to pay the
Frost note off in full. The company will then be obligated to these trusts in the future.
The terms and conditions of the new note with the trusts are: a one-year term, monthly
interest payments at an annual rate of 8.5% and quarterly principal payments of $250,000
beginning in the first quarter of 2005. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a simultaneous debt negotiation that enhances the company&#146;s balance sheet, Golden
Eagle announced that a long-time Golden Eagle shareholder and lender has agreed to convert
her current note and accrued interest with the company, totaling $1,037,000, to restricted
common stock at $0.045 per share. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
conversion completes a debt elimination process begun by the company two years ago. As a
result of that process the net equity on Golden Eagle&#146;s balance sheet has climbed to
$5.2 million. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We
are pleased with the confidence shown in Golden Eagle&#146;s future by these supportive
shareholders,&#148; stated Terry C. Turner, Golden Eagle&#146;s CEO. &#147;We have now
eliminated substantially all debt in the company with the exception of the new loan
announced today that we plan to pay off in 2005. Our company is on a very positive
financial course as we prepare to bring the Buen Futuro project on-line in Bolivia and
direct Golden Eagle toward sustained profitability. This financial restructuring through
the elimination of debt and interest significantly improves our ability to finance our
Buen Futuro project.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=1>Some of the statements in this press
release are forward-looking statements and as such are based on an assumed set of economic
conditions and courses of action. These include the ability of Golden Eagle to obtain the

operational hazards in Golden Eagle&#146;s mining and mine development activities,
uncertainties inherent in the calculation of mineral reserves, mineral resources and metal
recoveries, the timing and availability of financing, governmental and other approvals and
