<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH--(PR NEWSWIRE)--December 8, 2004---Golden Eagle announced
          today that it is actively engaged in the exchange of comprehensive information
          with funding sources regarding its ongoing efforts to debt-finance $10 million
          for its Buen Futuro gold and copper project in eastern Bolivia&#146;s
          Precambrian Shield. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We
are very encouraged by the feedback we are receiving in the financing process that we are
undertaking with a number of funding sources,&#148; stated Tracy A. Madsen, Golden
Eagle&#146;s CFO. &#147;We are confident that we can meet all of the requirements of these
financial institutions and will continue to promptly provide information as requested. The
financing process can be somewhat time-consuming due to the amount of detailed information
that must be disclosed and reviewed. However, once projected financing is in place, Golden
Eagle will be able to take advantage of the years of exploration and development work in
Buen Futuro, and install our capacity for production of 5,900 troy ounces of gold and 4.4
million pounds of copper per month.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden
Eagle is continuing its infrastructure improvements at Buen Futuro and today completed its
water well on-site to meet potable and production water needs. In addition, the company
has ongoing work programs with its engineers and some on-site dismantling efforts at its
Gold Bar mill and plant in Eureka, Nevada in preparation for full-scale dismantling once
its financing has been received. The company&#146;s Gold Bar mill and plant will then be
shipped to Bolivia and re-erected on Golden Eagle&#146;s Buen Futuro site. The company
estimates that dismantling, shipping and re-erection will require approximately 8 months
from the moment that financing is concluded. While Golden Eagle cannot guarantee that its
pending debt-financing at favorable rates will ultimately be successfully completed, the
company is very optimistic that its Buen Futuro project meets all of the requirements of
feasibility and will be financed. </FONT></P>
