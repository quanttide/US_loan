<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Franklin Bank Corp. Announces Definitive Agreement for The First National Bank
of Athens</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">HOUSTON, December&nbsp;21, 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ &#151; Franklin Bank Corp.
(Franklin)(Nasdaq: FBTX) announced the signing of an agreement to acquire The
First National Bank of Athens (Athens), which operates four banking offices
located in Henderson and Van Zandt Counties, Texas. Athens is a valuable
addition to the Franklin Family of Community Banks in East Texas, bolstering
its Jacksonville Bank and Cedar Creek Bank networks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Rusty Workman, president and chief executive officer of Athens, stated, &#147;We are
excited that the merger will increase the convenience to our customers through
this expanded branch network and additional banking products and services.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Don Wills, chairman of the board of Athens and president of the Ginger
Murchison Foundation, said, &#147;While this sale was necessitated due to the
unfortunate death of Ginger Murchison, we are convinced that the personal
relationship approach of our two institutions is so similar that a union with
Franklin was a natural fit for us.&#148; He added, &#147;the board of directors
unanimously approved the decision and views this transaction as a benefit to
our customers and our communities.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;This merger is consistent with our business strategy. It allows us to partner
with a well-established organization in a growing community and provides an
ideal fit for Franklin&#146;s trusted financial advisory community banking
approach,&#148; stated Anthony Nocella, Franklin&#146;s president and chief executive
officer. &#147;The commitment of both companies to our customers, employees and
communities is strong and will continue as we carry on our vision as the
premier community bank of Texas.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the merger, Athens shareholders would receive aggregate consideration
estimated at approximately $58.3&nbsp;million, seventy five percent in cash and
twenty five percent in shares of Franklin common stock. Franklin expects to
complete the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, and other
conditions set forth in the acquisition agreement, in the second quarter 2005.
As of September&nbsp;30, 2004, Athens had approximately $215.7&nbsp;million in assets,
$186.9&nbsp;million in deposits and $27.7&nbsp;million in stockholders&#146; equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Glenn Mealey, executive vice president of administration and acquisitions,
commented, &#147;We believe the transaction will enable us to
