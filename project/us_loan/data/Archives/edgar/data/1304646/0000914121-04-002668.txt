ITEM 8.01.  Other Events
            ------------

            On September 29, 2004, Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), sold Home Equity Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-2, Class AI-1A, Class AI-1B, Class AI-2, Class AI-3,
Class AI-4, Class AI-5, Class AI-6, Class AI-7, Class AI-8, Class AI-9, Class
AII-1A, Class AII-1B, Class AIII-1, Class AIII-2, Class AIII-3, Class M-1, Class
M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6 and Class M-7 (the "Offered
Certificates"), having an aggregate original principal balance of
$4,803,904,000. The Offered Certificates were issued pursuant to a Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2004, among the Registrant, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., as Servicer (the "Servicer" or "Wells Fargo Bank"), HSBC Bank
USA, National Association, as trustee, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as securities
administrator (the "Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto.
Home Equity Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2004-2, Class M-8A, Class M-8B,
Class M-9, Class M-10, Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates, having an
aggregate initial principal balance of $1,238,111,000 the "Private Certificates"
and, together with the Offered Certificates, the "Certificates", were also
issued pursuant to the Agreement.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 97.00% undivided interest in a trust fund (the "Trust
Estate"), consisting principally of a pool of fixed and adjustable interest
rate, conventional, monthly pay, one-to four-family residential first mortgage
loans. The remaining undivided interests in the Trust Estate are evidenced by
the Private Certificates. Distributions on the Private Certificates are
subordinated to distributions on the Offered Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement. Distributions of interest and in reduction of principal balance on
any Distribution Date will be made to the extent that Available Funds are
sufficient therefor.

            An election will be made to treat certain assets of the Trust Estate
as two REMICs for federal income tax purposes.

            The Depositor intends to sell pass-through certificates
(collectively, the "Certificates"), to be issued hereunder in multiple Classes,
which in the aggregate will evidence the entire beneficial ownership interest in
the Trust Fund created hereunder. The Certificates will consist of twenty-nine
Classes of Certificates, designated as (i) the Class AI-1A, Class AI-1B, Class
AI-2, Class AI-3, Class AI-4, Class AI-5, Class AI-6, Class AI-7, Class AI-8,
Class AI-9, Class AII-1A, Class AII-1B, Class AIII-1, Class AIII-2 and Class
AIII-3 Certificates, (ii) the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class

                                     REMIC 1

            As provided herein, the Trustee will make an election to treat the
segregated pool of assets consisting of the Mortgage Loans and certain other
related assets subject to this Agreement (but exclusive of the Yield Maintenance
Agreements, the Reserve Funds, the Cap Carryover Amounts, the Prepayment
Penalties, the Servicer Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts and the Originator
Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts) as a real estate investment conduit (a
"REMIC") for federal income tax purposes, and such segregated pool of assets
will be designated as "REMIC 1." The Class R-1 Interest will represent the sole
class of "residual interests" in REMIC 1 for purposes of the REMIC Provisions
under federal income tax law. The following table irrevocably sets forth the
designation, the Uncertificated REMIC 1 Pass-Through Rate, the initial
Uncertificated Principal Balance, and solely for purposes of satisfying Treasury
Regulations Section 1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii), the "latest possible maturity date" for
each of the REMIC 1 Regular Interests. None of the REMIC 1 Regular Interests
will be certificated.

            (iv) Each original recorded intervening assignment of the Mortgage
      as may be necessary to show a complete chain of title from the Mortgage

      with evidence of recordation noted thereon or attached thereto, or a copy
      of such assignment with such evidence of recordation to be true and

      assignment has been submitted for recordation but has not been returned
      from the applicable public recording office or is not otherwise available,

      property is located.

            (c) If any assignment of a Mortgage to the Trustee is in the process
of being recorded on the Closing Date, the Depositor shall use its best efforts
to cause each such original recorded document or certified copy thereof to be
delivered to the Custodian promptly following its recordation, but in no event
later than one (1) year following the Closing Date. If any Mortgage has been
recorded in the name of MERS or its designee, no assignment of Mortgage in favor
of the Trustee will be required to be prepared or delivered and instead, the
Master Servicer shall take all actions as are necessary to cause the Trust Fund
to be shown as the owner of the related Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for
the purpose of the system of recording transfers of beneficial ownership of
mortgages maintained by MERS. The Depositor shall also cause to be delivered to
the Custodian any other original mortgage loan document included in the Owner
Mortgage File (and, if applicable, the Retained Mortgage File) if a copy thereof
has been delivered. The Depositor shall pay from its own funds, without any
right of reimbursement therefor, the amount of any costs, liabilities and
expenses incurred by the Trust by reason of the failure of the Depositor to
cause to be delivered to the Custodian within one (1) year following the Closing
Date any assignment of a Mortgage (except with respect to any Mortgage recorded
in the name of MERS) not delivered to the Custodian on the Closing Date.

            In lieu of recording an assignment of any Mortgage the Depositor
may, deliver or cause to be delivered to the Custodian the assignment of the
Mortgage Loan to the Trustee in a form suitable for recordation, if (i) with
respect to a particular state the Trustee and the Custodian have received an
Opinion of Counsel acceptable to it that such recording is not required to make
the assignment effective against the parties to the Mortgage or subsequent
purchasers or encumbrancers of the Mortgaged Property or (ii) the Depositor has
been advised by each Rating Agency that non-recordation in a state will not
result in a reduction of the rating assigned by that Rating Agency at the time
of initial issuance of the Certificates. Set forth on Exhibit Q attached hereto
is a list of all states where recordation is required by either Rating Agency to
obtain the initial ratings of the Certificates. The Custodian may rely and shall
be protected in relying upon the information contained in such Exhibit Q. In the
event that the Custodian receives notice that recording is required to protect
the right, title and interest of the Trustee in and to any such Mortgage Loan
for which recordation of an assignment has not previously been required, the
Custodian shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Custodian shall within five
Business Days (or such other reasonable period of time mutually agreed upon by
the Custodian and the Trustee) of its receipt of such notice deliver each
previously unrecorded assignment to the related Servicer for recordation.

            (d) Except for Mortgage Notes endorsed in blank, endorsements shall
comply with the following format:

                                WITHOUT RECOURSE
                              PAY TO THE ORDER OF:

possible before the EPD Limit is exceeded. The Depositor shall repurchase any
EPD Mortgage Loan at the Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for the repurchased
Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Collection Account, and the Custodian,
upon receipt of written notice from the Servicer of such deposit, shall release
to the Depositor the related Mortgage File and shall execute (as agent of the
Trustee) and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse, as the Depositor shall furnish to it and as shall be necessary
to vest in the Depositor any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto and the
Custodian and the Trustee shall have no further responsibility with regard to
such Mortgage File.

Event, the Retained Mortgage File), and that it holds or will hold all such
assets and such other assets included in the definition of "Trust Fund" in trust
for the exclusive use and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders.

            The Custodian, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, shall
execute and deliver to the Servicer, the Securities Administrator, the Trustee
and the Depositor on or prior to the Closing Date an initial certification in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1 hereto, to the effect that, except as
may be specified in a list of exceptions attached thereto, it has received the
original Mortgage Notes (described in Section 2.01(a)(i)) relating to each
Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedules (other than any Mortgage
Loan that has been paid in full, liquidated or otherwise released as of the date
of such certification, and subject to any exceptions specifically identified in
the exception report annexed to such certification).

            The Custodian will review each Owner Mortgage File within 45 days
after execution of this Agreement. The Custodian will deliver no later than 30
days after completion of such review to the Seller and the Trustee a final
certification in the form of Exhibit F-2 hereto to the effect that, except as
may be specified in a list of exceptions attached thereto, all required
documents set forth in Section 2.01(a) have been executed and received and
appear regular on their face, and that such documents relate to the Mortgage
Loans identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule based on a comparison of the
Mortgage Loan identifying number, Mortgagor name and street address, and in so
doing the Custodian may rely on the purported due execution and genuineness of
any such document and on the purported genuineness of any signature thereon.

            If in the process of reviewing the Mortgage Files and making or
preparing, as the case may be, the certifications referred to above, the
Custodian finds any document or documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File
to be missing or defective in any material respect, at the conclusion of its
review the Custodian shall so notify the Depositor, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Servicer.

            The Depositor and the Trustee intend that the assignment and
transfer herein contemplated constitute a sale of the Mortgage Loans and the
Related Documents, conveying good title thereto free and clear of any liens and
encumbrances, from the Depositor to the Trustee and that such property not be
part of the Depositor's estate or property of the Depositor in the event of any
insolvency by the Depositor. In the event that such conveyance is deemed to be,
or to be made as security for, a loan, the parties intend that the Depositor
shall be deemed to have granted and does hereby grant to the Trustee, on behalf
of the Trust, a first priority perfected security interest in all of the
Depositor's right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans and the
Related Documents, and that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement
under applicable law.

            The Securities Administrator is hereby directed to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the Trust, the Yield Maintenance Agreements.

            Section 2.03 Repurchase or Substitution of Mortgage Loans by the
Depositor.

            (a) Upon discovery or receipt of written notice of any materially
defective document in, or that a document is missing from, an Owner Mortgage
File (or, if applicable, a Retained Mortgage File) or of a breach of a
representation of warranty of the Depositor in Section 2.04 hereof, in respect
of any Mortgage Loan and, except for a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in clause (ee) of Section 2.04, such breach materially
adversely affects the value of such Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Penalty or the
interest therein of the Certificateholders, the Trustee (or the Custodian) shall
promptly notify the Depositor and the Servicer of such defect, missing document
or breach and request that the Depositor cure such defect or breach or deliver
such missing document within 60 days from the date the Depositor was notified of
such missing document, breach or defect. If the Depositor does not deliver such
missing document or cure such defect or cure such breach in all material
respects during such period, the Depositor shall repurchase such Mortgage Loan
from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price on or prior to the Determination Date
following the expiration of such period (subject to Section 2.03(d)). The
Purchase Price for the repurchased Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the
Collection Account, and the Custodian, upon receipt of written notice from the
Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the Depositor the related Owner
Mortgage File (and, if applicable, Retained Mortgage File). The Trustee shall
execute and deliver such instrument of transfer or assignment (or, in the case
of a Mortgage Loan registered in the name of MERS or its designee, the Servicer
shall reflect such assignment on the records of MERS), in each case without
recourse, and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse, as the Depositor shall furnish to it and as shall be necessary
to vest in the Depositor any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto and the
Custodian and the Trustee shall have no further responsibility with regard to
such Owner Mortgage File (and, if applicable, Retained Mortgage File). In lieu
of repurchasing any such Mortgage Loan as provided above, the Depositor may
cause such Mortgage Loan to be removed from the Trust Fund (in which case it
shall become a Defective Mortgage Loan) and substitute one or more Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans in the manner and subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 2.03(d).

            It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 2.04 hereof shall survive delivery of the Owner Mortgage
Files (and, if applicable, Retained Mortgage Files) to the Custodian and shall
inure to the benefit of the Certificateholders notwithstanding any restrictive
or qualified endorsement or assignment. It is understood and agreed that the
obligations of the Depositor set forth in this Section 2.03(a) to cure,
substitute for or repurchase a Mortgage Loan and to pay the Reimbursement Amount
constitute the sole remedies available to the Certificateholders and to the
Trustee on their behalf respecting a breach of the representations and
warranties in Section 2.04 hereof.

            (b) In addition to the foregoing, in the case of a breach of the
Depositor's representation set forth in Section 2.04(i) and (dd) hereof, the
Depositor shall pay to the Trust the Reimbursement Amount. The Reimbursement
Amount shall be delivered to the Servicer for deposit into the Collection
Account within 10 days from the date the Depositor was notified by the Trustee
of the amount of such costs and damages.

            (c) Within 90 days of the earlier of discovery by the Servicer or
receipt of notice by the Servicer of the breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant of the Servicer set forth in Section 2.05 which materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan,
the Servicer shall cure such breach in all material respects.

            (d) Any substitution of Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans for
Defective Mortgage Loans made pursuant to Section 2.03(a) must be effected prior
to the last Business Day that is within two years after the Closing Date. As to
any Defective Mortgage Loan for which the Depositor substitutes an Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, such substitution shall be effected by the
Depositor delivering to the Custodian, on the Trustee's behalf for such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the documents required by Section 2.01,
together with an Officers' Certificate providing that each such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan satisfies the definition thereof and specifying the
Substitution Adjustment Amount (as described below), if any, in connection with
such substitution. The Custodian shall acknowledge receipt for such Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and, within ten Business Days thereafter, the
Custodian shall review such documents as specified in Section 2.02 and deliver
to the Servicer and the Trustee, with respect to such Eligible Substitute
Mortgage Loan or Loans, a certification substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F-1, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon. Within one
year of the date of substitution, the Custodian shall deliver to the Servicer
and the Trustee a certification substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 hereto
with respect to such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, with any
applicable exceptions noted thereon. Monthly Payments due with respect to
Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution are not part of
the Trust Fund and will be retained by the Depositor. For the month of
substitution, distributions to Certificateholders will reflect the collections
and recoveries in respect of such Defective Mortgage Loan in the Collection
Period or Prepayment Period, as applicable, preceding the date of substitution
and the Depositor shall thereafter be entitled to retain all amounts
subsequently received in respect of such Defective Mortgage Loan. The Depositor
shall give or cause to be given written notice to the Certificateholders that
such substitution has taken place, shall amend the applicable Mortgage Loan
Schedule to reflect the removal of such Defective Mortgage Loan from the terms
of this Agreement and the substitution of the Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan
or Loans and shall deliver a copy of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the
Trustee. Upon such substitution, such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans
shall constitute part of the Mortgage Pool and shall be subject in all respects
to the terms of this Agreement, including all applicable representations and
warranties as of the date of substitution.

            For any month in which the Depositor substitutes one or more
Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Defective Mortgage Loans,
including any substitution pursuant to Section 2.08, the Servicer will determine
the amount (the "Substitution Adjustment Amount"), if any, by which the
aggregate Purchase Price of all such Defective Mortgage Loans (or Mortgage Loan,
in the case of a substitution pursuant to Section 2.08) exceeds the aggregate,
as to each such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan, of the principal balance
thereof as of the date of substitution, together with one month's interest on
such principal balance at the applicable Net Mortgage Interest Rate. On the date
of such substitution, the Depositor will deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account an amount equal to the
Substitution Adjustment Amount, if any, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the
related Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and notice by the Servicer of
such deposit, shall release to the Depositor the related Owner Mortgage File
(and, if applicable, Retained Mortgage File) and shall execute and deliver such
instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as the
Depositor shall deliver to it and as shall be necessary to vest therein any
Defective Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto.

            In addition, the Depositor shall obtain at its own expense and
deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
substitution will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund,
including without limitation, any federal tax imposed on "prohibited
transactions" under Section 860F(a)(l) of the Code or on "contributions after
the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(l) of the Code, or (b) any REMIC to fail
to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding. If such
Opinion of Counsel can not be delivered, then such substitution may only be
effected at such time as the required Opinion of Counsel can be given.

            (e) Upon discovery by the Depositor, the Seller, the Servicer, the
Securities Administrator, the Custodian or the Trustee that any Mortgage Loan
does not constitute a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code, the party discovering such fact shall within two
Business Days give written notice thereof to the other parties. In connection
therewith, the Depositor shall repurchase or, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 2.03(d), substitute one or more Eligible Substitute Mortgage
Loans for the affected Mortgage Loan within 60 days of the earlier of discovery
or receipt of such notice with respect to such affected Mortgage Loan. In
addition, upon discovery that a Mortgage Loan is defective in a manner that
would cause it to be a "defective obligation" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations relating to REMICs, the Depositor shall cure the defect or make the
required purchase or substitution no later than 60 days after the discovery of
the defect. Any such repurchase or substitution shall be made in the same manner
as set forth in Section 2.03(a). The Trustee shall reconvey to the Depositor the
Mortgage Loan to be released pursuant hereto in the same manner, and on the same
terms and conditions, as it would a Mortgage Loan repurchased for breach of a
representation or warranty.

            Section 2.04 Representations and Warranties of the Depositor with
respect to the Mortgage Loans.

      The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Certificateholders that as of the Closing Date or as of such
other date specifically provided herein:

            (a) The information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedules was
true and correct in all material respects, including, without limitation, the
information regarding any Prepayment Penalty, at the date or dates respecting
which such information was furnished as specified in the Mortgage Loan
Schedules;

            (b) Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment contemplated
herein, the Depositor was the sole owner and holder of the Mortgage Loan free
and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any
nature and has full right and authority to sell and assign the same;

            (c) All payments required to be made up to the Due Date for such
Mortgage Loan immediately preceding the Closing Date under the terms of the
related Mortgage Note have been made and no Mortgage Loan had more than one
delinquency in the 12 months preceding the applicable Cut-off Date;

            (d) The Mortgage Note, the related Mortgage and other agreements
executed in connection therewith are genuine, and each is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the maker thereof, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by general equity principles (regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and, to the best
of the Depositor's knowledge, all parties to the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage
had legal capacity to execute the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and each
Mortgage Note and Mortgage has been duly and properly executed by the Mortgagor;

            (e) All taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums, and
water, sewer and municipal charges, which previously became due and owing have
been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established, to the extent permitted
by law, in an amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid;
and neither the Servicer nor the Depositor has advanced funds, or received any
advance of funds by a party other than the Mortgagor, directly or indirectly for
the payment of any amount required by the Mortgage, except for interest accruing
from the date of the Mortgage Note or date of disbursement of the Mortgage Loan
proceeds, whichever is later, to the day which precedes by thirty days the first
Due Date under the related Mortgage Note;

            (f) Neither the Depositor nor any prior holder of the Mortgage or
the related Mortgage Note has modified the Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note
in any material respect, satisfied, canceled or subordinated the Mortgage in
whole or in part, released the Mortgaged Property in whole or in part from the
lien of the Mortgage, or executed any instrument of release, cancellation,
modification or satisfaction, except in each case as is reflected in an
agreement delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian pursuant to Section 2.01;

            (g) No Mortgage Note or Mortgage is subject to any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury,
nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage Note or Mortgage, or
the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Mortgage Note or Mortgage
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject it to any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
respect thereto;

            (h) The Mortgage is a valid, subsisting and enforceable first lien
on the property therein described, and the Mortgaged Property is free and clear
of all encumbrances and liens having priority over the first lien of the
Mortgage except for liens for real estate taxes and special assessments not yet
due and payable and liens or interests arising under or as a result of any
federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance relating to hazardous
wastes or hazardous substances, and, if the related Mortgaged Property is a
condominium unit, any lien for common charges permitted by statute or homeowners
association fees; and any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent
document related to, and delivered to the Trustee or to the Custodian with, any
Mortgage establishes in the Depositor a valid and subsisting first lien on the
property described therein and the Depositor has full right to sell and assign
the same to the Trustee;

            (i) Each Mortgage Loan at the time it was originated complied in all
material respects with applicable federal, state and local laws including,
without limitation, truth-in-lending, real estate settlement procedures,
consumer credit protection, equal credit opportunity, predatory and abusive
lending laws and disclosure laws;

            (j) Each Mortgaged Property is located in the United States and
consists of a one- to four-unit residential property, which may include a
detached home, townhouse, condominium unit, a unit in a planned unit development
or a manufacturing housing unit which constitutes real property for purposes of
the applicable state law;

            (k) Except for Mortgage Loans secured by residential long-term
leases, the Mortgaged Property consists of a fee simple estate in real property;
all of the improvements which are included for the purpose of determining the
appraised value of the Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the boundaries and
building restriction lines of such property and no improvements on adjoining
properties encroach upon the Mortgaged Property (unless insured against under
the related title insurance policy); and to the best of the Depositor's
knowledge, the Mortgaged Property and all improvements thereon comply with all
requirements of any applicable zoning and subdivision laws and ordinances;

            (l) With respect to each Mortgage where a lost note affidavit has
been delivered to the Custodian on the Trustee's behalf in place of the related
Mortgage Note, the related Mortgage Note is no longer in existence;

            (m) The proceeds of the Mortgage Loans have been fully disbursed,
there is no requirement for future advances thereunder and any and all
requirements as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvements and as to
disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with (except for
escrow funds for exterior items which could not be completed due to weather and
escrow funds for the completion of swimming pools); and all costs, fees and
expenses incurred in making, closing or recording the Mortgage Loan have been
paid, except recording fees with respect to Mortgages not recorded as of the
Closing Date;

            (n) The Mortgage Loan (except any Mortgage Loan secured by a
Mortgaged Property located in any jurisdiction, as to which an opinion of
counsel of the type customarily rendered in such jurisdiction in lieu of title
insurance is instead received) is covered by an American Land Title Association
mortgagee title insurance policy or other generally acceptable form of policy or
insurance acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, issued by a title insurer
acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac insuring the originator, its successors
and assigns, as to the first priority lien of the Mortgage in the original
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and subject only to (A) the lien of
current real property taxes and assessments not yet due and payable, (B)
covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other
matters of public record as of the date of recording of such Mortgage acceptable
to mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the Mortgaged Property is
located or specifically referred to in the appraisal performed in connection
with the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, (C) liens created pursuant to
any federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance affording liens for the
costs of clean-up of hazardous substances or hazardous wastes or for other
environmental protection purposes and (D) such other matters to which like
properties are commonly subject which do not individually, or in the aggregate,
materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided
by the Mortgage; the Depositor is the sole insured of such mortgagee title
insurance policy, the assignment to the Trustee of the Depositor's interest in
such mortgagee title insurance policy does not require any consent of or
notification to the insurer which has not been obtained or made, such mortgagee
title insurance policy is in full force and effect and will be in full force and
effect and inure to the benefit of the Trustee, no claims have been made under
such mortgagee title insurance policy, and no prior holder of the related
Mortgage, including the Depositor, has done, by act or omission, anything which
would impair the coverage of such mortgagee title insurance policy;

            (o) To the best of the Depositor's knowledge, there is no default,
breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the
related Mortgage Note and no event which, with the passage of time or with
notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration; the Depositor has not
waived any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration; and no
foreclosure action is currently threatened or has been commenced with respect to
the Mortgage Loan;

            (p) The Mortgaged Property is free and clear of all mechanics' and
materialmen's liens or liens in the nature thereof; provided, however, that this
warranty shall be deemed not to have been made at the time of the initial
issuance of the Certificates if a title policy affording, in substance, the same
protection afforded by this warranty is furnished to the Trustee by the
Depositor;

            (q) The Mortgage Loan meets, or is exempt from, applicable state or
federal laws, regulations and other requirements, pertaining to usury, and the
Mortgage Loan is not usurious;

            (r) To the best of the Depositor's knowledge, all inspections,
licenses and certificates required to be made or issued with respect to all
portions of the Mortgaged Property and, with respect to the use and occupancy of
the same, including, but not limited to, certificates of occupancy and fire
underwriting certificates, have been made or obtained from the appropriate
authorities;

            (s) Each Mortgage Note (other than with respect to any Balloon
Loans) is payable in monthly payments, resulting in complete amortization of the
Mortgage Loan over a term of not more than 360 months;

            (t) Each Mortgage contains customary and enforceable provisions such
as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the
realization against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of the security,
including realization by judicial foreclosure (subject to any limitation arising
from any bankruptcy, insolvency or other law for the relief of debtors), and
there is no homestead or other exemption available to the Mortgagor which would
interfere with such right of foreclosure;

            (u) The Mortgaged Property is undamaged by water, fire, earthquake,
earth movement other than earthquake, windstorm, flood, tornado or similar
casualty (excluding casualty from the presence of hazardous wastes or hazardous
substances, as to which the Depositor makes no representations), so as to affect
adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan
or the use for which the premises were intended and to the best of the
Depositor's knowledge, there is no proceeding pending or threatened for the
total or partial condemnation of the Mortgaged Property;

            (v) The Mortgaged Property securing each Mortgage Loan is insured by
an insurer acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac against loss by fire and such
hazards as are covered under a standard extended coverage endorsement, in an
amount which is not less than the lesser of 100% of the insurable value of the
Mortgaged Property and the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan,
but in no event less than the minimum amount necessary to fully compensate for
any damage or loss on a replacement cost basis; if the Mortgaged Property is a
condominium unit, it is included under the coverage afforded by a blanket policy
for the project; if upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the improvements on
the Mortgaged Property were in an area identified in the Federal Register by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards, a flood
insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
Federal Insurance Administration is in effect with a generally acceptable
insurance carrier, in an amount representing coverage not less than the least of
(A) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (B) the full
insurable value of the Mortgaged Property and (C) the maximum amount of
insurance which was available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended; and each Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain all
such insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense;

            (w) To the best of the Depositor's knowledge, no Mortgagor is a
debtor in any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

            (x) If the Mortgage Loan is secured by a long-term residential
lease, (1) the lessor under the lease holds a fee simple interest in the land;
(2) the terms of such lease expressly permit the mortgaging of the leasehold
estate, the assignment of the lease without the lessor's consent and the
acquisition by the holder of the Mortgage of the rights of the lessee upon
foreclosure or assignment in lieu of foreclosure or provide the holder of the
Mortgage with substantially similar protections; (3) the terms of such lease do
not (a) allow the termination thereof upon the lessee's default without the
holder of the Mortgage being entitled to receive written notice of, and
opportunity to cure, such default, (b) allow the termination of the lease in the
event of damage or destruction as long as the Mortgage is in existence, (c)
prohibit the holder of the Mortgage from being insured (or receiving proceeds of
insurance) under the hazard insurance policy or policies relating to the
Mortgaged Property or (d) permit any increase in rent other than pre-established
increases set forth in the lease; (4) the original term of such lease is not
less than 15 years; (5) the term of such lease does not terminate earlier than
five years after the maturity date of the Mortgage Note; and (6) the Mortgaged
Property is located in a jurisdiction in which the use of leasehold estates in
transferring ownership in residential properties is a widely accepted practice;

            (y) None of the Mortgage Loans are classified as "high cost"
Mortgage Loans under Section 32 of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
of 1994 as amended or any comparable state law;

            (z) With respect to each Mortgage Loan that has a Prepayment
Penalty, each such Prepayment Penalty shall be enforceable, and each Prepayment
Penalty shall be permitted pursuant to federal, state and local law. Each such
Prepayment Penalty is in an amount less than or equal to the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law;

            (aa) Each Mortgage Loan is a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning
of Section 860G of the Code and Treas. Reg. ss.1.860G-2;

            (bb) No Mortgage Loan is a "high cost" loan as defined under any
federal, state or local law applicable to such Mortgage Loan at the time of its
origination;

            (cc) No Mortgage Loan is serviced by the Trustee or an affiliate of
the Trustee;

            (dd) No Mortgage Loan (other than a Mortgage Loan that is a New
Jersey covered purchase loan) is a High Cost Loan or Covered Loan, as applicable
(as such terms are defined in S&P's LEVELS(R) Glossary Version 5.6 Revised,
Appendix E), no Mortgage Loan originated on or after October 1, 2002 through
March 6, 2003 is governed by the Georgia Fair Lending Act and no Mortgage Loan
originated on or after March 7, 2003 is a "high cost home loan" as defined under
the Georgia Fair Lending Act; and

            (ee) In addition to the foregoing representations and warranties
made in subparagraphs (a) through (dd) above, the Depositor further represents
and warrants upon delivery of the Group II Mortgage Loans, as to each, that:

            (i) No mortgage loan is covered by the Home Ownership and Equity
      Protection Act of 1994;

            (ii) With respect to each Group II Mortgage Loan, none of the
      proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to finance single-premium credit
      life insurance policies;

            (iii) With respect to each Group II Mortgage Loan, the Servicer has
      furnished accurate and complete information on the related borrower credit
      files to Equifax, Experian and Trans Union Credit Information Company, in
      accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing
      regulations;

            (iv) The unpaid principal balance of each Group II Mortgage Loan
      does not exceed the applicable maximum original loan amount limitations
      with respect to first lien one- to four-family residential mortgage loans
      as set forth in the Freddie Mac Selling Guide;

            (v) With respect to each Group II Mortgage Loan that has a
      Prepayment Penalty, no such Prepayment Penalty may be imposed for a term
      in excess of five (5) years with respect to Mortgage Loans originated
      prior to October 1, 2002 and three (3) years with respect to Mortgage
      Loans originated on or after October 1, 2002;

            (vi) No Group II Mortgage Loan is a "high-cost," "high-cost home,"
      "covered" (excluding home loans defined as "covered home loans" pursuant
      to clause (1) of the definition of that term in the New Jersey Home
      Ownership Security Act of 2002), "high-risk home" or "predatory" loan
      under any applicable federal, state or local predatory or abusive lending
      law; and

            (vii) With respect to any Group II Mortgage Loan originated on or
      after August 1, 2004, neither the related Mortgage nor the related
      Mortgage Note requires the borrower to submit to arbitration to resolve
      any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the mortgage loan
      transaction.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representations or warranties are
made by the Depositor as to the environmental condition of any Mortgaged
Property; the absence, presence or effect of hazardous wastes or hazardous
substances on any Mortgaged Property; any casualty resulting from the presence
or effect of hazardous wastes or hazardous substances on, near or emanating from
any Mortgaged Property; the impact on Certificateholders of any environmental
condition or presence of any hazardous substance on or near any Mortgaged
Property; or the compliance of any Mortgaged Property with any environmental
laws, nor is any agent, person or entity otherwise affiliated with the Depositor
authorized or able to make any such representation, warranty or assumption of
liability relative to any Mortgaged Property. In addition, no representations or
warranties are made by the Depositor with respect to the absence or effect of
fraud in the origination of any Mortgage Loan.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in this Section 2.04 shall survive delivery of the respective Owner
Mortgage Files (and, if applicable, Retained Mortgage Files) to the Custodian
and shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee notwithstanding any restrictive or
qualified endorsement or assignment.

            Section 2.05 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the
Servicer.

            The Servicer hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the
Trustee, for the benefit of each of the Trustee and the Certificateholders and
to the Depositor and the Securities Administrator that as of the Closing Date or
as of such date specifically provided herein:

            (i) The Servicer is a national banking association duly chartered
      and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the United States
      and has all licenses necessary to carry on its business as now being
      conducted, except for such licenses, certificates and permits the absence
      of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material
      adverse effect on the ability of the Servicer to conduct its business as
      it is presently conducted, and is licensed, qualified and in good standing
      in the states where the Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such
      state require licensing or qualification in order to conduct business of
      the type conducted by the Servicer or to ensure the enforceability or
      validity of each Mortgage Loan; the Servicer has the power and authority
      to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform in accordance
      herewith; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
      (including all instruments of transfer to be delivered pursuant to this
      Agreement) by the Servicer and the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized; and all
      requisite corporate action has been taken by the Servicer to make this
      Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in accordance with its
      terms;

            (ii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement are in the ordinary course of business of the Servicer and will
      not result in the breach of any term or provision of the articles of
      incorporation or by-laws of the Servicer or result in the breach of any
      term or provision of, or conflict with or constitute a default under or
      result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any agreement,
      indenture or loan or credit agreement or other instrument to which the
      Servicer or its property is subject, or result in the violation of any
      law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Servicer or
      its property is subject;

            (iii) The Servicer is an approved seller/servicer of conventional
      residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the
      facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for the sound
      servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. The
      Servicer is a HUD approved mortgagee pursuant to Section 203 of the
      National Housing Act and is in good standing to sell mortgage loans to and
      service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and no event has
      occurred, including but not limited to a change in insurance coverage,
      which would make the Servicer unable to comply with Fannie Mae or Freddie
      Mac eligibility requirements or which would require notification to either
      Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;

            (iv) This Agreement, and all documents and instruments contemplated
      hereby which are executed and delivered by the Servicer, constitute and
      will constitute valid, legal and binding obligations of the Servicer,
      enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as the
      enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
      reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement
      of creditors' rights generally (whether considered in a proceeding at law
      or in equity);

            (v) The Servicer does not believe, nor does it have any reason or
      cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant contained
      in this Agreement;

            (vi) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending
      or, to its knowledge, threatened against the Servicer that, either
      individually or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse
      change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or
      assets of the Servicer, or in any material impairment of the right or
      ability of the Servicer to carry on its business substantially as now
      conducted, or in any material liability on the part of the Servicer, or
      that would draw into question the validity or enforceability of this
      Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in connection with the
      obligations of the Servicer contemplated herein, or that would be likely
      to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the
      terms of this Agreement;

            (vii) No consent, approval or order of any court or governmental
      agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by
      the Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with this Agreement or the
      consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
      for such consents, approvals, authorizations and orders, if any, that have
      been obtained; and

            (viii) No information in this Agreement provided by the Servicer nor
      any information, certificate of an officer, statement furnished in writing
      or report delivered to the Trustee or the Securities Administrator by the
      Servicer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby contains
      or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will
      omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
      contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
      made, not misleading.

            (ix) The Servicer has fully furnished, and shall continue to fully
      furnish for so long as it is servicing the Mortgage Loans hereunder, in
      accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing
      regulations, accurate and complete information on the Mortgagor credit
      files to Equifax, Experian and Trans Union Credit Information Company on a
      monthly basis.

            It is understood and agreed that the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Section 2.05 shall survive delivery of the Mortgage
Files to the Custodian and shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee, the
Depositor, the Securities Administrator and the Certificateholders. Upon
discovery by any of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator or
the Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing representations, warranties and
covenants which materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan,
Prepayment Penalty or the interests therein of the Certificateholders, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice (but in no event later
than two Business Days following such discovery) to the other parties hereto.

            Section 2.06 Representations and Warranties of the Depositor.

            The Depositor represents and warrants to the Trust and the Trustee
on behalf of the Certificateholders and to the Servicer and Securities
Administrator as follows:

            (i) This agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
      of the Depositor, enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its
      terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or
      hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in
      general and except as such enforceability may be limited by general
      principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
      equity);

            (ii) Immediately prior to the sale and assignment by the Depositor
      to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust of each Mortgage Loan, the Depositor
      had good and marketable title to each Mortgage Loan (insofar as such title
      was conveyed to it by the Seller) subject to no prior lien, claim,
      participation interest, mortgage, security interest, pledge, charge or
      other encumbrance or other interest of any nature;

            (iii) As of the Closing Date, the Depositor has transferred all
      right, title interest in the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee on behalf of
      the Trust;

            (iv) The Depositor has not transferred the Mortgage Loans to the
      Trustee on behalf of the Trust with any intent to hinder, delay or defraud
      any of its creditors;

            (v) The Depositor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing
      as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
      with full corporate power and authority to own its assets and conduct its
      business as presently being conducted;

            (vi) The Depositor is not in violation of its certificate of
      incorporation or by-laws or in default in the performance or observance of
      any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any
      contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other
      instrument to which the Depositor is a party or by which it or its
      properties may be bound, which default might result in any material
      adverse changes in the financial condition, earnings, affairs or business
      of the Depositor or which might materially and adversely affect the
      properties or assets, taken as a whole, of the Depositor;

            (vii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
      the Depositor, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
      thereby, do not and will not result in a material breach or violation of
      any of the terms or provisions of, or, to the knowledge of the Depositor,
      constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
      agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Depositor is a
      party or by which the Depositor is bound or to which any of the property
      or assets of the Depositor is subject, nor will such actions result in any
      violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
      of the Depositor or, to the best of the Depositor's knowledge without
      independent investigation, any statute or any order, rule or regulation of
      any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the
      Depositor or any of its properties or assets (except for such conflicts,
      breaches, violations and defaults as would not have a material adverse
      effect on the ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under
      this Agreement);

            (viii) To the best of the Depositor's knowledge without any
      independent investigation, no consent, approval, authorization, order,
      registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency
      or body of the United States or any other jurisdiction is required for the
      issuance of the Certificates, or the consummation by the Depositor of the
      other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such consents,
      approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as (a) may be
      required under State securities or Blue Sky laws, (b) have been previously
      obtained or (c) the failure of which to obtain would not have a material
      adverse effect on the performance by the Depositor of its obligations
      under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement; and

            (ix) There are no actions, proceedings or investigations pending
      before or, to the Depositor's knowledge, threatened by any court,
      administrative agency or other tribunal to which the Depositor is a party
      or of which any of its properties is the subject: (a) which if determined
      adversely to the Depositor would have a material adverse effect on the
      business, results of operations or financial condition of the Depositor;
      (b) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or the Certificates; (c)
      seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the consummation by
      the Depositor of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
      as the case may be; or (d) which might materially and adversely affect the
      performance by the Depositor of its obligations under, or the validity or
      enforceability of, this Agreement.

            Section 2.07 Issuance of Certificates and the Uncertificated Regular
Interests.

            The Trustee acknowledges the assignment to it of the Mortgage Loans
and the delivery to the Custodian on its behalf of the Mortgage Files, subject
to the provisions of Sections 2.01 and 2.02, and the Trustee acknowledges the
assignment to it of all other assets included in the Trust Fund, receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged. Concurrently with such assignment and delivery and
in exchange therefor, the Securities Administrator, pursuant to the Written
Order to Authenticate executed by an officer of the Depositor, has executed, and
the Certificate Registrar has authenticated and delivered to or upon the order
of the Depositor, the Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R
Certificates) in minimum dollar denominations of $25,000 and integral dollar
multiples of $1 in excess. The Class CE and Class P Certificates are issuable
only in minimum Percentage Interests of 10%. The Class R Certificate is issuable
only as a single certificate. The Trustee acknowledges the issuance of the
uncertificated REMIC 1 Regular Interests and declares that it hold such regular
interests as assets of REMIC 2. The Trustee acknowledges the obligation of the
Class CE Certificates to pay Cap Carryover Amounts, and declares that it hold
the same as assets of the Grantor Trust on behalf of the Holders of the Class
AI-1A, Class AII-1A, Class AII-1B, Class AIII-1, Class AIII-2, Class AIII-3,
Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6, Class M-7,
Class M-8A and Class M-9 Certificates, respectively. In addition to the assets
described in the preceding sentence, the assets of the Grantor Trust shall also
include (i) Prepayment Penalties, any Servicer Prepayment Penalty Payment
Amounts, any Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts and the beneficial
interest of the Class P Certificates with respect thereto and (ii) the Yield
Maintenance Agreements, the Reserve Accounts and the beneficial interest of the
Class CE Certificates with respect thereto, subject to the obligation to pay Cap
Carryover Amounts. The interests evidenced by the Certificates constitute the
entire beneficial ownership interest in the Trust Fund.

            Section 2.08 Optional Substitution of Mortgage Loans.

            During the three-month period beginning on the Closing Date, the
Depositor shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion
for any reason, to substitute for any Mortgage Loan, an Eligible Substitute
Mortgage Loan. Any such substitution shall be carried out in the manner
described in Section 2.03. The Substitution Adjustment Amount, if any, plus
accrued interest thereon and the other amounts referred to in Section 2.03,
shall be deposited in the Certificate Account. For purposes of determining the
Substitution Adjustment Amount for any Mortgage Loan substituted pursuant to

                                   ARTICLE III

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                                OF THE TRUST FUND

            Section 3.01 Servicer to Act as Servicer.

            The Servicer, as independent contract servicer, shall service and
administer the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement and the normal
and usual standards of practice of sub-prime mortgage servicers servicing
similar mortgage loans in the same respective jurisdictions as the Mortgaged
Properties, and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do or
cause to be done any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which the Servicer may deem necessary or desirable and consistent
with the terms of this Agreement (the "Servicing Standards").

            Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may waive,
modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of
strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any
Mortgagor if in the Servicer's reasonable determination such waiver,
modification, postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the
Certificateholders; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not make future
advances and (unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage
Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer, reasonably
foreseeable) the Servicer shall not permit any modification with respect to any
Mortgage Loan that would (i) change the Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive
the payment thereof of any principal or interest payments, reduce the
outstanding principal amount (except for actual payments of principal) or extend
the final maturity date with respect to such Mortgage Loan, (ii) affect
adversely the status of any REMIC as a REMIC or (iii) cause any REMIC to be
subject to a tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant to the
REMIC Provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not permit
any modification with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would both (x) effect an
exchange or reissuance of such Mortgage Loan under Section 1.860G-2(b) of the
Treasury Regulations and (y) cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust Fund
to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code or the imposition of any tax on
"prohibited transactions" or "contributions" after the Startup Day under the
REMIC Provisions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer
shall continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on
behalf of itself and the Trustee, all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable
instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the
Mortgaged Properties. The Servicer shall make all required Servicing Advances
and shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans in accordance with
Applicable Regulations, and shall provide to the Mortgagor any reports required
to be provided to them thereby. By the execution of this Agreement, the Trustee
hereby grants to the Servicer, a power of attorney to enable the Servicer to
carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder; provided, however,
that the Trustee shall not be held liable for any misuse of any such power of
attorney by the Servicer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Servicer shall not, without the Trustee's written consent: (i)
initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without
indicating the Servicer's representative capacity; or (ii) take any action with
the intent to cause, and that actually causes, the Trustee to be registered to
do business in any state.

            In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer
shall employ procedures including collection procedures and exercise the same
care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account giving due consideration to accepted mortgage
servicing practices of prudent lending institutions and the Certificateholders'
reliance on the Servicer.

            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of a voluntary Principal Prepayment in full of a Mortgage Loan, the
Servicer may not waive any Prepayment Penalty or portion thereof required by the
terms of the related Mortgage Note unless (i)(a) the Servicer determines that
such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar mortgage loans, (b)
such waiver relates to a default or a reasonably foreseeable default and (c)
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, maximize recovery of
Liquidation Proceeds for such Mortgage Loan, taking into account the value of
such Prepayment Penalty, or (ii) the enforceability thereof is limited (1) by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, or other similar law relating
to creditors' rights generally or (2) due to acceleration in connection with a
foreclosure or other involuntary payment. If the Servicer has waived or does not
collect all or a portion of a Prepayment Penalty relating to a voluntary
Principal Prepayment in full due to any action or omission of the Servicer,
other than as provided above, the Servicer shall, on the date on which the
Principal Prepayment in full is remitted to the Securities Administrator,
deliver to the Securities Administrator the Servicer Prepayment Penalty Amount
with respect to such Mortgage Loan for distribution in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

            In the event that a Prepayment Penalty due with respect to any
Mortgage Loan is not timely received by the Servicer, the Servicer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to determine whether the Originator is obligated
to pay a related Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amount, and if the
Servicer determines that a Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amount is due,
the Servicer shall promptly notify the Originator, and the Servicer shall
enforce the Originator's obligations to pay in a timely manner any such
Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts and, to the extent that such amounts are
received by the Servicer, shall cause such amounts to be deposited into the
Collection Account within one Business Day of receipt.

            Section 3.02 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

            Continuously from the date hereof until the principal and interest
on all Mortgage Loans are paid in full or as long as the Mortgage Loan remains
subject to this Agreement, the Servicer will diligently collect all payments due
under each Mortgage Loan when the same shall become due and payable and shall,
to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with the Servicing Standards
set forth in this Agreement and Applicable Regulations, follow such collection
procedures as it follows with respect to mortgage loans comparable to the
Mortgage Loans and held for its own account. Further, where applicable, the
Servicer will take special care in ascertaining and estimating annual Escrow
Payments that, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, will become due and payable
to that end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient
to pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

            Section 3.03 Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

            In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not
paid when the same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails
to perform any other covenant or obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such
failure continues beyond any applicable grace period, the Servicer shall take
such action as it shall deem to be in the best interest of the
Certificateholders.

            In connection with a foreclosure or other conversion, the Servicer
shall exercise such rights and powers vested in it hereunder and use the same
degree of care and skill in its exercise as it would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of its own affairs and consistent with Applicable
Regulations and the Servicing Standards, including, without limitation,
advancing funds for the payment of taxes and insurance premiums with respect to
first lien Mortgage Loans.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.03, with
respect to any Mortgage Loan as to which the Servicer has received actual notice
of, or has actual knowledge of, the presence of any toxic or hazardous substance
on the related Mortgaged Property, the Servicer shall not either (i) obtain
title to such Mortgaged Property as a result of or in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise, or (ii) otherwise acquire possession of, or take any other action
with respect to, such Mortgaged Property if, as a result of any such action, the
Trust would be considered to hold title to, to be a mortgagee-in-possession of,
or to be an owner or operator of such Mortgaged Property within the meaning of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended from time to time, or any comparable law, unless the Servicer
has also previously determined, based on its reasonable judgment and a report
prepared by a Person who regularly conducts environmental audits using customary
industry standards, stating that:

            A. such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable
environmental laws or, if not, that it would be in the best economic interest of
the Certificateholders to take such actions as are necessary to bring the
Mortgaged Property into compliance therewith; and

            B. there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged Property
relating to the use, management or disposal of any hazardous substances,
hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based materials for which
investigation, testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could
be required under any federal, state or local law or regulation, or that if any
such materials are present for which such action could be required, that it
would be in the best economic interest of the Certificateholders to take such
actions with respect to the affected Mortgaged Property.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such environmental audit reveals,
or if the Servicer has actual knowledge or notice, that such Mortgaged Property
contains such wastes or substances, the Servicer shall not foreclose or accept a
deed in lieu of foreclosure without the prior written consent of the NIMS
Insurer.

            The cost of the environmental audit report contemplated by this
Section 3.03 shall be advanced by the Servicer, subject to the Servicer's right
to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as provided in Section
3.05(ii).

            If the Servicer determines, as described above, that it is in the
best economic interest of the Certificateholders to take such actions as are
necessary to bring any such Mortgaged Property into compliance with applicable
environmental laws, or to take such action with respect to the containment,
clean-up or remediation of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous
wastes, or petroleum-based materials affecting any such Mortgaged Property, then
the Servicer shall take such action as it deems to be in the best economic
interest of the Certificateholders. The cost of any such compliance,
containment, cleanup or remediation shall be advanced by the Servicer, subject
to the Servicer's right to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as
provided in Section 3.05(ii).

            Section 3.04 Collection Account, Distribution Account and Reserve
Accounts.

            (a) The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to each Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own
funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more accounts
(such account or accounts, the "Collection Account"). Each Collection Account
shall be an Eligible Account.

            The Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account within three
Business Days of receipt, and retain therein, the following payments and
collections received or made by it after the applicable Cut-off Date with
respect to the Mortgage Loans, without duplication:

            (i) all payments on account of principal, including Principal
      Prepayments, on the Mortgage Loans;

            (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
      adjusted to the Mortgage Interest Rate less the Servicing Fee Rate;

            (iii) all Net Liquidation Proceeds and Subsequent Recoveries;

            (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be
      deposited pursuant to Section 3.10, other than proceeds to be held in the
      Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
      Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Servicer's
      normal servicing procedures, the loan documents or applicable law;

            (v) all Condemnation Proceeds affecting any Mortgaged Property which
      are not released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Servicer's normal
      servicing procedures, the loan documents or applicable law;

            (vi) any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer in
      connection with any REO Property pursuant to Section 3.13;

            (vii) all Prepayment Penalties collected by the Servicer in
      connection with the voluntary Principal Prepayment in full of any of the
      Mortgage Loans, all Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts paid by
      the Originator and all Servicer Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts
      required to be paid by the Servicer pursuant to Section 3.01 in connection
      with any such Principal Prepayment; and

            (viii) all amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer pursuant
      to Section 2.03.

            Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Collection Account,
subject to Section 3.23, shall accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the
Servicer shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.05(v). The foregoing requirements for
deposit from the Collection Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and
agreed that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the
nature of late payment charges, bad check fees, prepayment penalties that are
not Prepayment Penalties, Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts or
Servicer Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts, assumption fees and other similar
fees need not be deposited by the Servicer in the Collection Account. Amounts
deposited into the Collection Account in error may be withdrawn at any time.

            (b) On behalf of the Trust Fund, the Securities Administrator shall
establish and maintain one or more accounts (such account or accounts, the
"Distribution Account"), on behalf of the Trustee, held in trust for the benefit
of the Certificateholders. On behalf of the Trust Fund, the Servicer shall
deliver to the Securities Administrator in immediately available funds for
deposit in the Distribution Account by 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the
Servicer Remittance Date, (i) that portion of the Available Funds (calculated
without regard to the references in the definition thereof to amounts that may
be deposited to the Distribution Account from a different source as provided
herein) then on deposit in the Collection Account, (ii) the amount of all
Prepayment Penalties collected by the Servicer in connection with the voluntary
Principal Prepayment in full of any of the Mortgage Loans then on deposit in the
Collection Account (other than any such Prepayment Penalties received after the
related Prepayment Period), (iii) any Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment

related Prepayment Period and (iv) amounts reimbursable or payable to the
Trustee pursuant to Section 7.01 and Section 8.05 and amounts reimbursable or
payable to the Securities Administrator pursuant to Section 8.05 or Section

as otherwise provided in Section 3.04(f), amounts in the Distribution Account
shall be deemed to be held on behalf of the related REMICs in accordance with
the REMIC distributions set forth in Section 4.08. The Securities Administrator
may, from time to time, withdraw from the Distribution Account for the following
purposes:

            (i) to pay to itself and to the Trustee any amounts owed to itself
      and the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.05, any amounts owed to itself
      pursuant to Section 9.01(c) and any amounts owed to the Trustee pursuant
      to Section 7.01;

            (ii) to pay to itself as compensation any interest earned on funds
      in the Distribution Account (all such interest to be withdrawn monthly on

      termination of this Agreement.

            (c) Funds in the Collection Account and the Distribution Account may
be invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with the provisions set forth
in Section 3.23. The Servicer shall give notice to the Securities Administrator
(and the Securities Administrator shall give such notice to the NIMS Insurer and
the Trustee) of the location of the Collection Account maintained by it when
established and prior to any change thereof. The Securities Administrator shall
give notice to the Servicer, the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and the Depositor of
the location of the Distribution Account when established and prior to any
change thereof.

            (d) In the event the Servicer shall deliver to the Securities
Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account any amount not required to
be deposited therein, it may at any time request that the Securities
Administrator withdraw such amount from the Distribution Account and remit to
the Servicer any such amount, any provision herein to the contrary
notwithstanding. In addition, the Servicer shall deliver to the Securities
Administrator from time to time for deposit, and the Securities Administrator
shall so deposit, in the Distribution Account in respect of REMIC 1:

            (i) any Advances, as required pursuant to Section 4.07;

            (ii) any Stayed Funds, as soon as permitted by the federal
      bankruptcy court having jurisdiction in such matters;

            (iii) any Prepayment Penalties or amounts in connection with the
      waiver of such Prepayment Penalties, in each case required to be deposited
      pursuant to Section 3.01;

            (iv) any amounts required to be deposited in the Distribution
      Account pursuant to Sections 2.03, 3.04, 3.16, 3.23 or 4.07; and

            (v) any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer pursuant to
      Section 3.11 in connection with the deductible clause in any blanket
      hazard insurance policy, such deposit being made from the Servicer's own
      funds, without reimbursement therefor.

            (e) Promptly upon receipt of any Stayed Funds, whether from the
Servicer, a trustee in bankruptcy, or federal bankruptcy court or other source,
the Securities Administrator shall, unless such funds have been received from
the Servicer, notify the Servicer of such receipt and deposit such funds in the
Distribution Account, subject to withdrawal thereof as permitted hereunder. In
addition, the Securities Administrator shall deposit in the Distribution Account
any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section 3.23(b) in connection
with losses realized on Permitted Investments with respect to funds held in the
Distribution Account.

            (f) Any Prepayment Penalties, Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment
Amounts and Servicer Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts deposited pursuant to
Section 3.04(a)(vii) shall not be assets of any REMIC created hereunder, but
shall be considered assets of the Grantor Trust held by the Securities
Administrator, on behalf of the Trustee, for the benefit of the Class P
Certificateholders. In addition, any Cap Carryover Amounts that are paid with
respect to the Class A or Class M Certificates will be treated as first having
been distributed with respect to the Class CE Certificates and then having been
paid outside of the REMICs to the Class A or Class M Certificateholders.

            (g) The Securities Administrator shall establish and maintain (I)
the Class AI Reserve Account, held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of

            (h) The Securities Administrator shall account for the Reserve
Accounts as assets of a grantor trust under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of
the Code and not assets of any REMIC created pursuant to this Agreement. The
beneficial owner of the Reserve Accounts is the Class CE Certificateholder. For
all federal tax purposes, amounts transferred or reimbursed by REMIC 2 to the
Reserve Accounts shall be treated as distributions by the Securities
Administrator to the Class CE Certificateholder.

            (i) Any Cap Carryover Amounts paid by the Securities Administrator
pursuant to Section 3.04(g) to the Regular Certificates (other than the Class CE

paid first to the Class CE Certificates and then to the respective Class or
Classes of Regular Certificates (other than the Class CE Certificates). In
addition, the Securities Administrator shall account for the Regular
Certificates' (other than the Class CE Certificates) rights to receive payments
of Cap Carryover Amounts as rights in a limited recourse interest rate cap
contract written by the Class CE Certificates in favor of the Regular
Certificates (other than the Class CE Certificates).

            (j) For federal tax return and information reporting, the right of
the Holders of the Regular Certificates (other than the Class CE Certificates)

Payment, the Upper Mezzanine Yield Maintenance Agreement, the Middle Mezzanine

            Section 3.05 Permitted Withdrawals From the Collection Account.

            The Servicer may, from time to time, withdraw from the Collection
Account for the following purposes:

            (i) to remit to the Securities Administrator for deposit in the
      Distribution Account the amounts required to be so remitted pursuant to
      Section 3.04(b) or permitted to be so remitted pursuant to the first
      sentence of Section 3.04(d);

            (ii) first, to the extent the Servicer has not previously reimbursed
      the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.07(e), to reimburse the Trustee for any
      unreimbursed Advances made by the Trustee and second, to reimburse itself
      for any unreimbursed Advances and Servicing Advances; the Servicer's right
      to reimburse itself and the Trustee pursuant to this subclause (ii) being
      limited to amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent
      payments of (a) principal and/or interest respecting which any such
      Advance was made or (b) Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or
      Liquidation Proceeds respecting which any such Servicing Advance was made;

            (iii) first, to the extent the Servicer has not previously
      reimbursed the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.07(e), to reimburse the
      Trustee for any unreimbursed Advances made by the Trustee and second to
      reimburse itself for any unreimbursed Servicing Advances, any unpaid
      Servicing Fees and for unreimbursed Advances, in each case, to the extent
      that such amounts are deemed to be Nonrecoverable Advances, and to
      reimburse itself and the Trustee for such amounts to the extent that such
      amounts are nonrecoverable from the disposition of REO Property pursuant
      to Section 3.03 or Section 3.13 hereof;

            (iv) to reimburse itself for any amounts paid or expenses incurred
      pursuant to Section 3.03 (and not otherwise previously reimbursed);

            (v) to pay to itself as servicing compensation (a) any interest
      earned on funds in the Collection Account (all such interest to be
      withdrawn monthly not later than each Servicer Remittance Date) and (b)
      the Servicing Fee from that portion of any payment or recovery as to
      interest to a particular Mortgage Loan to the extent not retained pursuant
      to Section 3.04(ii);

            (vi) to reimburse itself for any amounts paid pursuant to Section
      6.03 (and not otherwise previously reimbursed);

            (vii) to reimburse the NIMS Insurer, the Servicer (if the Servicer
      is not an Affiliate of the repurchasing party), the Securities
      Administrator or the Trustee, as the case may be, for enforcement expenses
      reasonably incurred in respect of the breach or defect giving rise to the
      purchase obligation under Section 2.03 of this Agreement that were
      included in the Purchase Price of the Mortgage Loan, including any
      expenses arising out of the enforcement of the purchase obligation;

            (viii) to reimburse the Depositor, the Servicer or the NIMS Insurer
      for expenses and costs reimbursable to them pursuant to Section 3.24(b);
      and

            (ix) to clear and terminate the Collection Account upon the
      termination of this Agreement.

            The foregoing requirements for withdrawal from the Collection
Account shall be exclusive. In the event the Servicer shall deposit in the
Collection Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at
any time withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision herein
to the contrary notwithstanding.

            Section 3.06 Establishment of Escrow Accounts; Deposits in Escrow
Accounts.

            The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to each Mortgage Loan which constitute Escrow Payments
separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall
establish and maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit
or demand accounts. A copy of such letter agreement shall be furnished to the
Trustee upon request. The Escrow Account shall be an Eligible Account.

            The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts within
three Business Days of receipt, and retain therein, (i) all Escrow Payments
collected on account of the Mortgage Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely
payment of any such items as required under the terms of this Agreement, and
(ii) all Insurance Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or repair
of any Mortgaged Property. The Servicer shall make withdrawals therefrom only to
effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, and for such other
purposes as shall be set forth in, or in accordance with, Section 3.07. The
Servicer shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on funds deposited in the
Escrow Account by the depository institution other than interest on escrowed
funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor and, to the extent required by
the related Mortgage Loan or Applicable Regulations, the Servicer shall pay
interest on escrowed funds to the Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow
Account is non-interest bearing or that interest paid thereon is insufficient
for such purposes.

            Section 3.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

            Withdrawals from the Escrow Account may be made by the Servicer (i)
to effect timely payments of Escrow Payments, (ii) to reimburse the Servicer for
any Servicing Advance made by the Servicer with respect to a related Mortgage
Loan but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent
late payments or Late Collections of Escrow Payments thereunder, (iii) to refund
to the Mortgagor any funds as may be determined to be overages, (iv) for
transfer to the Collection Account in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
Property, (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or to the Mortgagor to the extent
required by the related Mortgage Loan or Applicable Regulations, any interest
paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account, (vii) to clear and terminate
the Escrow Account on the termination of this Agreement, or (viii) to transfer
to the Collection Account any Insurance Proceeds. As part of its servicing
duties, the Servicer shall pay to the Mortgagor interest on funds in the Escrow
Account, to the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan or Applicable
Regulations, and to the extent that interest earned on funds in the Escrow
Account is insufficient, shall pay such interest from its own funds, without any
reimbursement therefor.

            In the event the Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account any
amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such
amount from the Escrow Account, any provision herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

            Section 3.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges;
Collections Thereunder; Primary Mortgage Insurance.

            (a) With respect to each Mortgage Loan subject to an Escrow
Agreement, the Servicer shall maintain accurate records reflecting the status of
taxes, which are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the status
of fire, flood (if applicable) and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain,
from time to time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal
premiums) and shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or
termination date and at a time appropriate for securing maximum discounts
allowable, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow
Account which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in
amounts sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Escrow
Agreement or Applicable Regulations. To the extent that a Mortgage Loan is not
subject to an Escrow Agreement, the Servicer shall determine that any such
payments are made by the Mortgagor. The Servicer assumes full responsibility for
the payment of all such bills and shall effect payments of all such bills
irrespective of the Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or
the making of the Escrow Payments and shall make Servicing Advances from its own
funds to effect such payments.

            (b) For any Mortgage Loan with a Loan-to-Value Ratio at origination
of greater than 80%, if the Mortgage Loan Schedule indicates that such Mortgage
Loan has primary mortgage insurance, the Servicer shall maintain coverage under
a primary mortgage insurance policy until the Loan-to-Value Ratio on any such
Mortgage Loan is reduced to 78% or lower as a result of principal payments on
such Mortgage Loan or based upon an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Servicer shall be responsible for the payment of all primary mortgage insurance
premiums out of the Servicer's own funds, without any right to reimbursement
therefor. The Servicer shall not assign its obligation under any primary
mortgage insurance policy without the consent of each Rating Agency. In the
event that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is no longer Servicer hereunder, Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. agrees to continue pay all primary mortgage insurance premiums for
the Mortgage Loans.

            Section 3.09 Transfer of Accounts.

            The Servicer may transfer the Collection Account or the Escrow
Account to a different depository institution from time to time. Upon such
transfer, the Servicer shall deliver to the Securities Administrator (and the
Securities Administrator shall provide to the Depositor and the Trustee), a
certification or letter agreement, as the case may be, as required pursuant to
Sections 3.04 and 3.06.

            Section 3.10 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

            The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan
fire and hazard insurance with extended coverage as is customary in the area
where the Mortgaged Property is located in an amount which is at least equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to fully compensate for any damage or
loss to the improvements which are a part of such property on a replacement cost
basis or (ii) the Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan, in each case in an
amount not less than such amount as is necessary to prevent the Mortgagor and/or
the Mortgagee from becoming a co-insurer. If the Mortgaged Property is in an
area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood Emergency Management Agency
as having special flood hazards and flood insurance has been made available, the
Servicer will cause to be maintained a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
with a generally acceptable insurance carrier, in an amount representing
coverage not less than the least of (i) the Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Loan, (ii) the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing such
Mortgage Loan or (iii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. The Servicer shall also
maintain on the REO Property for the benefit of the Certificateholders, (x) fire
and hazard insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal
to the replacement cost of the improvements which are a part of such property
and (y) to the extent required and available under the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in an amount as provided above. Any
amounts collected by the Servicer under any such policies other than amounts to
be deposited in the Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of
the Mortgaged Property or REO Property, or released to the Mortgagor in
accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing procedures, shall be deposited
in the Collection Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05. It is
understood and agreed that no earthquake or other additional insurance is
required to be maintained by the Servicer or the Mortgagor or maintained on
property acquired in respect of the Mortgage Loan, other than pursuant to such
Applicable Regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall require
such additional insurance. All such policies shall be endorsed with standard
mortgagee clauses with loss payable to the Servicer and shall provide for at
least thirty days prior written notice of any cancellation, reduction in the
amount of or material change in coverage to the Servicer. The Servicer shall not
interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of choice in selecting either his
insurance carrier or agent, provided, however, that the Servicer shall not
accept any such insurance policies from insurance companies unless such
companies currently reflect a general policy rating of B:VI or better in Best's
Key Rating Guide and are licensed to do business in the state wherein the
property subject to the policy is located.

            Section 3.11 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance Policy.

            In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a blanket
policy issued by an insurer that has a general policy rating of B:VI or better
in Best's Key Rating Guide insuring against hazard losses on all of the Mortgage
Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an amount equal to
the amount required pursuant to Section 3.10 and otherwise complies with all
other requirements of Section 3.10, it shall conclusively be deemed to have
satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 3.10, it being understood and
agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case the
Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on the
related Mortgaged Property or REO Property a policy complying with Section 3.10,
and there shall have been a loss which would have been covered by such policy,
deliver to the Securities Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account
the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy because of such
deductible clause, which amount shall not be reimbursable to the Servicer from
the Trust Fund. In connection with its activities as servicer of the Mortgage
Loans, the Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of the Trustee,
claims under any such blanket policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such policy. Upon request of the Securities Administrator, the Servicer
shall cause to be delivered to the Custodian and the Securities Administrator a
certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder
that such policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without
thirty days prior written notice to the Trustee.

            Section 3.12 Fidelity Bond, Errors and Omissions Insurance.

            The Servicer shall maintain, at its own expense, a blanket fidelity
bond (the "Fidelity Bond") and an errors and omissions insurance policy, with
broad coverage with financially responsible companies on all officers, employees
or other persons acting in any capacity with regard to the Mortgage Loans to
handle funds, money, documents and papers relating to the Mortgage Loans. The
Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance shall be in the form of the
Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Servicer against
losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such persons. Such Fidelity Bond shall also protect and insure
the Servicer against losses in connection with the failure to maintain any
insurance policies required pursuant to this Agreement and the release or
satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without having obtained payment in full of the
indebtedness secured thereby. No provision of this Section 3.12 requiring the
Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance shall diminish or relieve the
Servicer from its duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The
minimum coverage under any such bond and insurance policy shall be in an amount
acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Upon request of the Trustee or the NIMS
Insurer, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the NIMS
Insurer a certified true copy of the Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions
insurance policy and a statement from the surety and the insurer that such
Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance policy shall in no event be
terminated or materially modified without thirty days' prior written notice to
the Trustee and the NIMS Insurer.

            Section 3.13 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property.

            (a) In the event that title to a Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken in the name of the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders,
or in the event the Trustee is not authorized or permitted to hold title to real
property in the state where the REO Property is located, or would be adversely
affected under the "doing business" or tax laws of such state by so holding
title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of such Person
or Persons as shall be consistent with an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the
Servicer from an attorney duly licensed to practice law in the state where the
REO Property is located. Any Person or Persons holding such title other than the
Trustee shall acknowledge in writing that such title is being held as nominee
for the benefit of the Trustee. Pursuant to the power of attorney granted in
Section 3.01, the Servicer is hereby authorized to acquire, transfer and dispose
of any REO Property taken in the name of the Trustee pursuant to this Section
3.13 without further documentation of its authority as attorney in fact for the
Trustee on behalf of the Trust.

            (b) In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property as
aforesaid or otherwise in connection with a default or imminent default on a
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall dispose of such REO Property before the end of
the third calendar year beginning after the year of its acquisition by the Trust
Fund for purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or, at the expense of the
Trust Fund, request from the Internal Revenue Service, more than 60 days before
the day on which the above-mentioned grace period would otherwise expire, an
extension of the above-mentioned grace period, unless the Servicer obtains an
Opinion of Counsel acceptable to the NIMS Insurer, addressed and delivered to
the Servicer, the NIMS Insurer and the Trustee, to the effect that the holding
by the Trust Fund of such REO Property subsequent to such period will not: (i)
result in the imposition of any tax on "prohibited transactions" as defined in
Section 860F of the Code; or (ii) cause any REMIC constituting any part of the
Trust Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are
outstanding, in which case the Trust Fund may continue to hold such REO Property
(subject to any conditions contained in such Opinion of Counsel). The Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Collection Account for any costs
incurred in obtaining such Opinion of Counsel, as provided in Section 3.05.

            Subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations as shall
at any time be in force, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, no REO Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or
allowed to continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust
Fund in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would: (i) cause such REO
Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code; or (ii) subject any REMIC constituting part of
the Trust Fund to the imposition of any federal income taxes on the income
earned from such REO Property, including any taxes imposed by reason of Sections
860F or 860G(c) of the Code, unless the Servicer has agreed to indemnify and
hold harmless the Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

            The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO
Property for the Certificateholders and the Trust Fund solely for the purpose of
its prompt disposition and sale in a manner which does not cause such REO
Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or result in the receipt by the related REMIC of
any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning of Section
860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, or any "net income from foreclosure property" which
is subject to taxation under the REMIC Provisions. The Servicer shall cause each
REO Property to be inspected promptly upon the acquisition of title thereto and
possession thereof and shall cause each REO Property to be inspected at least
annually thereafter. The Servicer shall make or cause to be made a written or
electronic report of each such inspection. Such reports shall be retained in the
Mortgage File and copies thereof shall be forwarded by the Servicer to the
Trustee upon request. The Servicer shall attempt to sell the same (and may
temporarily rent the same) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer deems to
be in the best interest of the Certificateholders and the Trust Fund.

            With respect to each REO Property, the Servicer shall segregate and
hold all funds collected and received in connection with the operation of the
REO Property separate and apart from its own funds or general assets and shall
deposit or cause to be deposited, on a daily basis, within three Business Days
of receipt, into the Collection Account, all revenues received with respect to
the related REO Property and shall withdraw therefrom funds necessary for the
proper operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property, including the
cost of maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to Section 3.10 hereof and the
fees of any managing agent acting on behalf of the Servicer.

            The Servicer shall furnish to the Securities Administrator and the
Trustee, on each Servicer Remittance Date, an operating statement for each REO
Property covering the operation of each REO Property for the previous month, if
applicable. Such operation statement shall be accompanied by such other
information as the Securities Administrator or the Trustee shall reasonably
request.

            The Servicer shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as promptly as is practically consistent with protecting the
Certificateholders' interests.

            Each REO Disposition shall be carried out by the Servicer at such
price and upon such terms and conditions as the Servicer deems to be in the best
interest of the Certificateholders. If as of the date title to any REO Property
was acquired by the Servicer there were outstanding unreimbursed Servicing
Advances with respect to the REO Property, the Servicer, upon an REO Disposition
of such REO Property, shall be entitled to reimbursement for any related
unreimbursed Servicing Advances from proceeds received in connection with such
REO Disposition. The Servicer shall be entitled to an REO Disposition Fee upon
each REO Disposition, and may withhold and retain the REO Disposition Fee from
Liquidation Proceeds. The proceeds from the REO Disposition, net of any payments
to the Servicer as provided above, shall be deposited in the Collection Account
and shall be distributed to the Trust in the month following receipt thereof in
accordance with Section 4.01.

            Any REO Disposition shall be for cash only (unless changes in the
REMIC Provisions made subsequent to the Startup Day allow a sale for other
consideration and an Opinion of Counsel is obtained by the Servicer to the
effect that such sale shall not cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust
Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC).

            Section 3.14 Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption and Substitution
Agreements.

            When a Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be conveyed by the
Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance
or prospective conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of the
related Mortgage Loan under any "due-on-sale" clause contained in the related
Mortgage or Mortgage Note; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not
exercise any such right if the "due-on-sale" clause, in the reasonable belief of
the Servicer, is not enforceable under applicable law. In such event, the
Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to enter into an assumption and
modification agreement with the Person to whom such property has been or is
about to be conveyed, pursuant to which such Person becomes liable under the
Mortgage Note and, unless prohibited by applicable law or the Mortgage, the
Mortgagor remains liable thereon. If the foregoing is not permitted under
applicable law, the Servicer is authorized to enter into a substitution of
liability agreement with such Person, pursuant to which the original Mortgagor
is released from liability and such Person is substituted as Mortgagor and
becomes liable under the Note. The Mortgage Loan, as assumed, shall conform in
all respects to the requirements, representations and warranties of this
Agreement. The Servicer shall notify the Trustee that any such assumption or
substitution agreement has been completed by forwarding to the Trustee (or the
Custodian, as the case may be) the original copy of such assumption or
substitution agreement (indicating the Mortgage File to which it relates) which
copy shall be added by the Trustee (or the Custodian, as the case may be) to the
related Mortgage File and which shall, for all purposes, be considered a part of
such Mortgage File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments
constituting a part thereof. The Servicer shall be responsible for recording any
such assumption or substitution agreements. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.01, in connection with any such assumption or substitution agreement,
the Monthly Payment on the related Mortgage Loan shall not be changed but shall
remain as in effect immediately prior to the assumption or substitution, the
stated maturity or outstanding principal amount of such Mortgage Loan shall not
be changed nor shall any required monthly payments of principal or interest be
deferred or forgiven. Any fee collected by the Servicer for consenting to any
such conveyance or entering into an assumption or substitution agreement shall
be retained by or paid to the Servicer as additional servicing compensation.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph or any other provision of
this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default, breach or any
other violation of its obligations hereunder by reason of any assumption of a
Mortgage Loan by operation of law or any assumption which the Servicer may be
restricted by law from preventing, for any reason whatsoever.

            Section 3.15 Duties of the Credit Risk Manager.

            For and on behalf of the Depositor, the Credit Risk Manager shall
provide reports and recommendations as to loss mitigation activities concerning
Mortgage Loans that are past due, are in default, as to which there has been
commencement of foreclosure, as to which there has been forbearance in exercise
of remedies, as to which any obligor is the subject of bankruptcy, receivership,
or an arrangement of creditors, or which have become REO Properties. Such
reports and recommendations will be based upon information provided pursuant to
the Credit Risk Management Agreement. The Credit Risk Manager shall look solely
to the Servicer for all information and data (including loss and delinquency
information and data) and loan-level information and data relating to the
servicing of the Mortgage Loans.

            The Credit Risk Manager may be removed at any time by a vote of
Certificateholders holding Certificates evidencing at least 66 2/3% of the
aggregate Voting Interests of the Certificates. After any such termination, the
Credit Risk Manager shall have no further obligations hereunder, and shall no
longer be entitled to the Credit Risk Manager Fee.

            Section 3.16 Optional Purchases of 60+ Day Delinquent Loans.

            (a) The NIMS Insurer may, at its option, purchase a Mortgage Loan
which is a 60+ Day Delinquent Loan or for which the Servicer has accepted a deed
in lieu of foreclosure. Prior to purchase pursuant to this Section 3.16(a), the
Servicer shall be required to continue to make Advances pursuant to Section
4.07. The NIMS Insurer shall not use any procedure in selecting Mortgage Loans
to be repurchased which is materially adverse to the interests of the
Certificateholders. The NIMS Insurer shall purchase such delinquent Mortgage
Loan at a price equal to the Purchase Price of such Mortgage Loan. Any such
purchase of a Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 3.16(a) shall be
accomplished by remittance to the Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account
of the amount of the Purchase Price. The Trustee shall immediately effectuate
the conveyance of such delinquent Mortgage Loan to the NIMS Insurer to the
extent necessary to vest in the NIMS Insurer title to such Mortgage Loan,
including the prompt delivery of all documentation to the NIMS Insurer.

            (b) The Depositor may, at its option, with the consent of the NIMS
Insurer, purchase any 60+ Day Delinquent Loan or any Mortgage Loan or REO
Property for which the Servicer has accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure
during the following time periods: (i) beginning on the first day of the second
month following the month in which the Servicer has reported that it has
initiated foreclosure proceedings with respect to such 60+ Day Delinquent Loan,
with such repurchase option expiring on the last day of such second following
month; (ii) beginning on the first day of the second month following the month
in which the Servicer has reported that such defaulted Mortgage Loan has become
an REO Property, with such repurchase option expiring on the last day of such
second following month; and (iii) beginning on the day on which the Servicer
accepts a contractual commitment by a third party to purchase the Mortgaged
Property related to the 60+ Day Delinquent Loan or REO Property, with such
repurchase option expiring on the earlier of the last day of the month in which
such contractual commitment was accepted by the Servicer or the day immediately
prior to the day on which the closing occurs with respect to such third party
purchase of the Mortgaged Property related to the 60+ Day Delinquent Loan or REO
Property.

                  Prior to purchase pursuant to this Section 3.16, the Servicer
shall be required to continue to make monthly Advances pursuant to Section 4.07.
The Depositor shall not use any procedure in selecting Mortgage Loans to be
purchased which is materially adverse to the interests of the
Certificateholders. The Depositor shall purchase any such 60+ Day Delinquent
Loan or REO Property that it elects to purchase at a price equal to the Purchase
Price. The Purchase Price for the repurchased Mortgage Loan or REO Property
shall be deposited in the Collection Account, and the Trustee, upon receipt of
written certification from the Depositor of such deposit, shall release to, or
at the direction of, the Depositor, the related Mortgage File and shall execute
and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without
recourse, as the Depositor shall furnish to it and as shall be necessary to vest
in the Depositor any Mortgage Loan or REO Property released pursuant hereto and
the Trustee shall have no further responsibility with regard to such Mortgage
File.

            Section 3.17 Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Files.

            (a) Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan (including any
liquidation of any Mortgage Loan through foreclosure or otherwise, or the
receipt by the Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed
in a manner customary for such purposes), the Servicer shall confirm to the
Trustee and the Securities Administrator that all amounts required to be
remitted to the Distribution Account in connection with such Mortgage Loan have
been so deposited, and the Servicer shall deliver two copies of such Request for
Release to the Custodian. The Custodian shall, within five Business Days of its
receipt of such a Request for Release, release the related Owner Mortgage File
(and Retained Mortgage File, if applicable) to the Servicer, as requested by the
Servicer. No expenses incurred in connection with any instrument of satisfaction
or deed of reconveyance shall be chargeable to the Distribution Account.

            From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or
foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, including but not limited to, collection under
any insurance policies, or to effect a partial release of any Mortgaged Property
from the lien of the Mortgage, the Servicer shall deliver to the Custodian two
copies of a Request for Release. The Custodian shall, within five Business Days,
release the related Owner Mortgage File (and Retained Mortgage File, if
applicable) to the Servicer. Any such Request for Release shall obligate the
Servicer to return the Owner Mortgage File (and Retained Mortgage File, if
applicable) to the Custodian by the twenty-first day following the release
thereof, unless (i) the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated and the Liquidation
Proceeds relating to the Mortgage Loan have been deposited in the Distribution
Account or (ii) the Owner Mortgage File, Retained Mortgage File, if applicable,
or such document has been delivered to an attorney, or to a public trustee or
other public official as required by law, for purposes of initiating or pursuing
legal action or other proceedings for the foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property
either judicially or non-judicially. Upon receipt of two copies of a Request for
Release stating that such Mortgage Loan was liquidated and that all amounts
received or to be received in connection with such liquidation which are
required to be deposited into the Distribution Account have been so deposited,
or that such Mortgage Loan has become an REO Property, the Custodian shall amend
its records.

            Upon the occurrence of the event specified in clause (ii) of the
preceding paragraph, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Servicer, as
directed by the Servicer, court pleadings, requests for trustee's sale or other
documents necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale in respect of a
Mortgaged Property or to any legal action brought to obtain judgment against any
Mortgagor on the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or to obtain a deficiency judgment,
or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the Mortgage Note or
Mortgage or otherwise available at law or in equity. Each such direction shall
include a request that such pleadings or documents be executed by the Trustee
and a statement as to the reason such documents or pleadings are required and a
certification that the execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee will not
invalidate or otherwise affect the lien of the Mortgage, except for the
termination of such a lien upon completion of the foreclosure proceeding or
trustee's sale.

            (b) Subject to Section 3.01, the Servicer shall have the right to
accept applications of Mortgagors for consent to (i) partial releases of
Mortgages, (ii) alterations, and (iii) removal, demolition or division of
properties subject to Mortgages. No application for approval shall be considered
by the Servicer unless: (w) either (A) it has received an Opinion of Counsel,
addressed to the Trustee (which opinion shall not be an expense of the Trustee
or the Trust Fund) that such sale, disposition, substitution, acquisition or
contribution will not affect adversely the status of any REMIC constituting part
of the Trust Fund as a REMIC or cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust
Fund to be subject to a tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions"
pursuant to the REMIC Provisions or (B) other evidence satisfactory to the
Servicer; (x) the provisions of the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage have been
complied with; (y) the Loan-to-Value Ratio and debt-to-income ratio after any
release does not exceed the maximum Loan-to-Value Ratio and debt-to-income ratio
established in accordance with the underwriting standards of the Mortgage Loans;
and (z) the lien priority of the related Mortgage is not affected. Upon receipt
by the Trustee of a Servicing Officer's certificate setting forth the action
proposed to be taken in respect of a particular Mortgage Loan and certifying
that the criteria set forth in the immediately preceding sentence have been
satisfied, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Servicer the consent or
partial release so requested by, and furnished to it by, the Servicer. A
proposed form of consent or partial release, as the case may be, shall accompany
any Servicing Officer's certificate delivered by the Servicer pursuant to this
paragraph.

            Section 3.18 Servicing Compensation.

            As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Servicer shall be
entitled to retain the amount of the Servicing Fee with respect to each Mortgage
Loan (including REO Properties). The Servicer shall be entitled to retain
additional servicing compensation in the form of release fees, bad check
charges, assumption fees, modification or extension fees, late payment charges,
prepayment penalties that are not Prepayment Penalties, Originator Prepayment
Penalty Payment Amounts, Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts or REO
Disposition Fees, or any other service-related fees, Insurance Proceeds and
Liquidation Proceeds not required to be deposited in the Collection Account and
similar items, to the extent collected from Mortgagors. In addition, the
Servicer shall be entitled to the investment income on funds on deposit in the
Collection Account.

            Section 3.19 Annual Statement as to Compliance.

            (a) The Servicer, at its own expense, will deliver to the Securities
Administrator, not later than February 28 following the end of each calendar
year, commencing in February 2005, a Servicing Officer's certificate stating, as
to each signer thereof, that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer
during such preceding fiscal year (or such shorter period in the case of the
first such report) and of performance under this Agreement or similar agreements
has been made under such officers' supervision, and (ii) to the best of such
officer's knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its
obligations under this Agreement for such year, or, if there has been a default
in the fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each such default known
to such officers and the nature and status thereof including the steps being
taken by the Servicer to remedy such default. The Securities Administrator shall
forward such certificate to the Depositor, the Trustee and the NIMS Insurer
immediately upon receipt.

            (b) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the
Securities Administrator is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's,
Securities Administrator's and Depositor's receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable, from
information contained therein, including the Servicer's compliance with any of
its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee, the Securities Administrator
and the Depositor are entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

            Section 3.20 Annual Independent Certified Public Accountants'
Reports.

            (a) Not later than February 28 following the end of each calendar
year commencing with 2005, the Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants to
furnish to the Securities Administrator a report stating that (i) it has
obtained a letter of representation regarding certain matters from the
management of the Servicer which includes an assertion that the Servicer has
complied with certain minimum residential mortgage loan servicing standards,
identified in either the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers
established by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America or the Audit Program
for Mortgages serviced by FHLMC, with respect to the servicing of residential
mortgage loans during the most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) on the
basis of an examination conducted by such firm in accordance with standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, such
representation is fairly stated in all material respects, subject to such
exceptions and other qualifications that may be appropriate. The Securities
Administrator shall furnish a copy of such report to the Trustee, the NIMS
Insurer, the Depositor and each Rating Agency immediately upon receipt. Copies
of such statement shall be provided by the Trustee to any Certificateholder upon
request, provided that such statement has been delivered by the Servicer to the
Trustee.

            (b) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the
Trustee and the Securities Administrator is for informational purposes only and
the Trustee's and Securities Administrator's receipt of such shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable, from information contained therein, including the Servicer's
compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee and the
Securities Administrator are entitled to rely exclusively on Officers'
Certificates).

            Section 3.21 Access to Certain Documentation and Information
Regarding the Mortgage Loans.

            The Servicer shall provide to the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator, the NIMS Insurer, Certificateholders that are federally insured
savings and loan associations, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the FDIC and
the supervisory agents and examiners of each of the foregoing (which, in the
case of supervisory agents and examiners, may be required by applicable state
and federal regulations) access to the available documentation regarding the
Mortgage Loans, such access being afforded without charge but only upon
reasonable advance request and during normal business hours at the offices of
the Servicer designated by it.

            Upon request, the Servicer shall furnish to the Securities
Administrator its most recent financial statements and such other information
relating to the Servicer's capacity to perform its obligations under this
Agreement as it possesses. The Securities Administrator shall deliver such
financial statements to the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and the Trustee
immediately upon receipt. To the extent such information is not otherwise
available to the public, the Depositor, the Securities Administrator, the NIMS
Insurer and the Trustee shall not disseminate any information obtained pursuant
to the preceding sentence without the Servicer's written consent, except as
required pursuant to this Agreement or to the extent that it is appropriate to
do so (i) in working with legal counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other
governmental agencies or (ii) pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority
having jurisdiction over the Depositor and the Trustee or the Trust Fund, and in
any case, each of the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Securities Administrator
or the Trustee, as the case may be, shall use its best efforts to assure the
confidentiality of any such disseminated non-public information.

            Section 3.22 Obligations of the Servicer in Respect of Compensating
Interest.

            With respect to each Distribution Date, not later than the close of
business on the related Servicer Remittance Date, the Servicer shall deliver to
the Securities Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account an amount
("Compensating Interest") equal to the lesser of (A) the aggregate of the
Prepayment Interest Shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans for such Distribution Date
resulting from Principal Prepayments on the Mortgage Loans during the related
Prepayment Period and (B) its aggregate Servicing Fee received in the related
Collection Period. The Servicer shall apply Compensating Interest to offset any
Prepayment Interest Shortfalls attributable to Principal Prepayments in full on
the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall not have the right to reimbursement for
any amounts remitted to the Securities Administrator in respect of Compensating
Interest. Such amounts so remitted shall be included in the Available Funds and
distributed therewith on the next Distribution Date.

            Section 3.23 Investment of Funds in the Collection Account and the
Distribution Account.

            (a) The Servicer may direct in writing any depository institution
maintaining the Collection Account and the Securities Administrator may direct
in writing any depository institution maintaining the Distribution Account (for
purposes of this Section 3.23, each an "Investment Account"), to invest the
funds in such Investment Account in one or more Permitted Investments bearing
interest or sold at a discount, and maturing, unless payable on demand, (i) no
later than the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such funds
are required to be withdrawn from such account pursuant to this Agreement, if a
Person other than the Securities Administrator is the obligor thereon, and (ii)
no later than the date on which such funds are required to be withdrawn from
such account pursuant to this Agreement, if the Securities Administrator is the
obligor thereon. All such Permitted Investments shall be held to maturity,
unless payable on demand. Any investment of funds in an Investment Account shall
be made in the name of the Securities Administrator or the Servicer, as
applicable (in its capacity as such) or in the name of a nominee of the same.
The Servicer or the Securities Administrator, as applicable, shall be entitled
to sole possession over each such investment and the income thereon, and any
certificate or other instrument evidencing any such investment shall be
delivered directly to the Securities Administrator or its agent, together with
any document of transfer necessary to transfer title to such investment to the
Securities Administrator or its nominee. In the event amounts on deposit in an
Investment Account are at any time invested in a Permitted Investment payable on
demand, the Servicer or the Securities Administrator:

                  (x)   consistent with any notice required to be given
                        thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the
                        last day such Permitted Investment may otherwise mature
                        hereunder in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) all
                        amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount
                        required to be withdrawn on such date; and

                  (y)   demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly
                        upon determination by a Responsible Officer of the
                        Securities Administrator that such Permitted Investment
                        would not constitute a Permitted Investment in respect
                        of funds thereafter on deposit in the Investment
                        Account.

            (b) All income and gain realized from the investment of funds in the
Collection Account shall be for the benefit of the Servicer. The Servicer shall
deposit in the Collection Account the amount of any loss incurred in respect of
any such Permitted Investment made with funds in such account immediately upon
realization of such loss. All income and gain realized from the investment of
funds in the Distribution Account shall be for the benefit of the Securities
Administrator. The Securities Administrator shall deposit in the Distribution
Account the amount of any loss incurred on Permitted Investments in the
Distribution Account.

            (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any
default occurs in the making of a payment due under any Permitted Investment, or
if a default occurs in any other performance required under any Permitted
Investment, the Securities Administrator may and, subject to Section 8.01 and
Section 8.02(a)(v), upon the request of the NIMS Insurer or the Holders of
Certificates representing more than 50% of the Voting Rights allocated to any
Class of Certificates, shall take such action as may be appropriate to enforce
such payment or performance, including the institution and prosecution of
appropriate proceedings.

            Section 3.24 Liability of Servicer; Indemnification.

            (a) Subject to clause (b) below and Section 6.03, the Servicer
(except the Securities Administrator if it is required to succeed the Servicer
hereunder) indemnifies and holds the Trustee, the Securities Administrator, the
NIMS Insurer and the Depositor (and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates) and each Certificateholder harmless against any and all claims,
losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs,
judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the Trustee, the
Securities Administrator, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and any
Certificateholder may sustain in any way related to the failure of the Servicer
to perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in compliance with the
Servicing Standards. The Servicer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the
Securities Administrator, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and each
Certificateholder if a claim is made that may result in such claims, losses,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees or related costs, judgments, or any
other costs, fees and expenses, and the Servicer shall assume (with the consent
of the Securities Administrator) the defense of any such claim and pay all
expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable counsel fees, and
promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered
against the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator, the Depositor,
the NIMS Insurer and/or Certificateholder in respect of such claim. The
provisions of this Section 3.24 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the outstanding Certificates.

            (b) None of the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Servicer, or any of
the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer
or the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Trust Fund or the
Certificateholders for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of
any action, in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment;
provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Depositor, the NIMS
Insurer or the Servicer or any such Person against any breach of warranties or
representations made herein, or against any specific liability imposed on the
Servicer for a breach of the Servicing Standard, or against any liability which
would otherwise be imposed by reason of its respective willful misfeasance, bad
faith, fraud or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reasons of
negligent disregard of its respective obligations or duties hereunder.

            The Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Servicer and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer or the Servicer,
may rely in good faith on any document of any kind which, prima facie, is
properly executed and submitted by any appropriate Person with respect to any
matters arising hereunder. The Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Servicer and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer or the
Servicer shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Trust Fund against any
loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any legal action relating
to this Agreement or the Certificates, other than any loss, liability or expense
incurred in connection with any legal action incurred by reason of its
respective misfeasance, bad faith, fraud or negligence, a breach of a
representation or warranty hereunder or (in the case of the Servicer) a breach
of the Servicing Standard in the performance of its respective duties or by
reason of negligent disregard of its respective obligations or duties hereunder.
Neither the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer nor the Servicer shall be under any
obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action unless such action
is related to its respective duties under this Agreement and in its opinion does
not expose it to any expense or liability; provided, however, that each of the
Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and the Servicer may in its discretion undertake any
action related to its obligations hereunder which it may deem necessary or
desirable with respect to this Agreement and the rights and duties of the
parties hereto and the interests of the Certificateholders hereunder. The
Servicer's right to indemnity or reimbursement pursuant to this Section shall
survive any resignation or termination of the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04
or 7.01 with respect to any losses, expenses, costs or liabilities arising prior
to such resignation or termination (or arising from events that occurred prior
to such resignation or termination). In such event, unless the Depositor or the
Servicer acts without the consent of Holders of Certificates entitled to at
least 51% of the Voting Rights, the legal expenses and costs of such action and
any liability resulting therefrom (except any loss, liability or expense
incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties hereunder) shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of
the Trust Fund, and the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and the Servicer shall be
entitled to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as and to the
extent provided in Section 3.05, any such right of reimbursement being prior to
the rights of the Certificateholders to receive any amount in the Collection
Account.

            Section 3.25 Reports of Foreclosure and Abandonment of Mortgaged
Properties.

            On or before April 30 of each year beginning in 2005, the Servicer
shall file the reports of foreclosure and abandonment of any Mortgaged Property
required by Section 6050J of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service and
provide an Officer's Certificate certifying its compliance with this Section
3.25 to the Trustee. The reports from the Servicer shall be in form and
substance sufficient to meet the reporting requirements imposed by such Section
6050J.

            Section 3.26 Limitation of Liability of the Credit Risk Manager.

            Neither the Credit Risk Manager, nor any of the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Credit Risk Manager, shall be under any liability to
the Trustee, the Securities Administrator, the Certificateholders or the
Depositor for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, in reliance upon information provided
by the Servicer under the Credit Risk Management Agreement or for errors in
judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Credit
Risk Manager or any such person against liability that would otherwise be
imposed by reason of willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in its
performance of its duties or by reason of reckless disregard for its obligations
and duties under this Agreement or the applicable Credit Risk Management
Agreement. The Credit Risk Manager and any director, officer, employee or agent
of the Credit Risk Manager may rely in good faith on any document of any kind
prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising hereunder, and may rely in good faith upon the accuracy of information
furnished by the Servicer pursuant to the applicable Credit Risk Management
Agreement in the performance of its duties thereunder and hereunder.

            Section 3.27 No Personal Solicitation.

            From and after the Closing Date, the Servicer agrees that it will
not take any action or permit or cause any action to be taken by any of its
agents and Affiliates, or by any independent contractors or independent mortgage
brokerage companies on the Servicer's behalf, to personally, by telephone, mail
or electronic mail, solicit the Mortgagor under any Mortgage Loan for the
purpose of refinancing such Mortgage Loan; provided, that the Servicer may
solicit any Mortgagor for whom the Servicer has received a request for
verification of mortgage, a request for demand for payoff, a mortgagor initiated
written or verbal communication indicating a desire to prepay the related
Mortgage Loan, or the mortgagor initiates a title search; provided further, it
is understood and agreed that promotions undertaken by the Servicer or any of
its Affiliates which (i) concern optional insurance products or other additional
products or (ii) are directed to the general public at large, including, without
limitation, mass mailings based on commercially acquired mailing lists,
newspaper, radio and television advertisements shall not constitute solicitation
under this Section, nor is the Servicer prohibited from responding to
unsolicited requests or inquiries made by a Mortgagor or an agent of a
Mortgagor. Furthermore, the Servicer shall be permitted to include in its
monthly statements to borrowers or otherwise, statements regarding the
availability of the Servicer's counseling services with respect to refinancing
mortgage loans.

            Section 3.28 Periodic Filings.

            (a) The Securities Administrator and the Servicer shall reasonably
cooperate with the Depositor in connection with the Trust's satisfying the
reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The Securities Administrator shall prepare on behalf of the Trust any Forms 8-K
(other than the Form 8-K to which this Agreement is attached as a exhibit
thereto) and 10-K customary for similar securities as required by the Exchange
Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission thereunder, and the
Securities Administrator shall file (via the Commission's Electronic Data
Gathering and Retrieval System) such Forms on behalf of the Depositor. The
Servicer shall be responsible for signing all 8-Ks (other than the Form 8-K to
which this Agreement is attached as an exhibit thereto) and 10-Ks required to be
filed.

            (b) The Securities Administrator shall file a Form 8-K within 15
days after each Distribution Date, including a Form 8-K with a copy of the
statement to the Certificateholders for such Distribution Date as an exhibit
thereto. Prior to March 30th of each year (or such earlier date as may be
required by the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission),
the Securities Administrator shall file a Form 10-K, in substance as required by
applicable law or applicable Commission staff interpretations. Such Form 10-K
shall include as exhibits the Servicer's annual statement of compliance
described under Section 3.19 and the accountant's report described under Section
3.20, in each case to the extent they have been timely delivered to the
Securities Administrator. The Securities Administrator shall have no liability
with respect to any failure to properly prepare or file such periodic reports
resulting from or relating to the Securities Administrator's inability or
failure to obtain any information not resulting from its own negligence or
willful misconduct. The Form 10-K and any amended Form 10-K shall also include a
certification of the Servicer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit O (the
"Sarbanes Oxley Certification"), which shall be signed by the senior officer of
the Servicer in charge of its servicing, and which the Servicer shall deliver to
the Securities Administrator prior to March 15th of each year in which a Form
10-K is to be filed with respect to the Trust.

            (c) Not later than 15 calendar days before the date on which the
Depositor's annual report on Form 10-K is required to be filed in accordance
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission (or, if
such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day), the
Securities Administrator shall sign and deliver to the Servicer a certification
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit P (the "Securities Administrator's
Certification") for the benefit of the Servicer and its officers, directors and
Affiliates as to items 1 through 3 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Certification;
provided, however, that the Securities Administrator shall not undertake an
analysis of the accountant's report attached as an exhibit to the Form 10-K. In
addition, the Securities Administrator shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Servicer and each Person, if any, who "controls" the Servicer within the meaning
of the Securities Act and its officers, directors and Affiliates from and
against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and
necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses
arising out of or based upon a breach of the Securities Administrator's
obligations under this Section 3.28(c) or the Securities Administrator's
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith or any
inaccuracy in the Securities Administrator's Certification. If the
indemnification provided for in this Section 3.28(c) is unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless such Persons, then the Securities Administrator
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Persons as a result of
the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such Persons in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Depositor or the Servicer on
the one hand and the Securities Administrator on the other. The Securities
Administrator acknowledges that the Servicer is relying on the Securities
Administrator's performance of its obligations under this Section 3.28(c) in
order to perform its obligations under Section 3.28(b) above.

            (d) Upon any filing with the Commission, the Securities
Administrator shall promptly deliver to the Depositor a copy of any such
executed report, statement or information.

            (e) If the Commission issues additional interpretative guidance or
promulgates additional rules or regulations, or if other changes in applicable
law occur, which would require the reporting arrangements, or the allocation of
responsibilities with respect thereto, described in this Section 3.28, to be
conducted differently than as described, the Depositor, the Servicer and the
Securities Administrator will reasonably cooperate to amend the provisions of
this Section 3.28 in order to comply with such amended reporting requirements
and such amendment of this Section 3.28. Any such amendment shall be made in
accordance with Section 11.01 without the consent of the Certificateholders, and
may result in a change in the reports filed by the Securities Administrator on
behalf of the Trust under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Depositor, the Servicer or the Securities Administrator shall be
obligated to enter into any amendment pursuant to this Section 3.28 that
adversely affects its obligations and immunities under this Agreement.

            (f) Prior to January 30 of the first year in which the Securities
Administrator is able to do so under applicable law, the Securities
Administrator shall file a Form 15D Suspension Notification with respect to the
Trust.

            Section 4.03 Allocation of Losses.

            Realized Losses shall be allocated, through the priority of
distributions in Section 4.02, first against the Monthly Excess Interest Amount
and then against the Overcollateralization Amount until such amount has been
reduced to zero. If, after giving effect to the distribution of the Principal

the Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates)
exceeds the Pool Balance as of the end of the related Collection Period, the
resulting Applied Realized Loss Amount will be allocated against the Class M-10,
Class M-9, Class M-8A and Class M-8B (pro rata), Class M-7, Class M-6, Class
M-5, Class M-4, Class M-3, Class M-2 and Class M-1 Certificates, in that order
and until the respective Principal Balances thereof are reduced to zero. In
addition, on any Distribution Date after the Principal Balance of the Class M-1
Certificates has been reduced to zero, if after giving effect to the
distribution of the Principal Distribution Amount on such Distribution Date, the
aggregate Principal Balance of the Class AII-1A and Class AII-1B Certificates
exceeds the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Group II Mortgage Loans as
of the end of the related Collection Period, the resulting Class AII-1B Applied
Realized Loss Amount shall be allocated against the Class AII-1B Certificates
until their Principal Balance has been reduced to zero.

            Section 4.07 Remittance Reports; Advances.

            (a) On the 15th calendar day of each month, or the following
Business Day if such 15th calendar day is not a Business Day, the Servicer shall
deliver to the Securities Administrator by telecopy (or by such other means as
the Servicer and the Securities Administrator may agree from time to time) a
Remittance Report with respect to the related Distribution Date. On the same
date, the Servicer shall electronically forward to the Securities Administrator
in such medium as may be agreed between the Servicer and the Securities
Administrator the information set forth in such Remittance Report with respect
to the related Distribution Date and such information reasonably available to
the Servicer necessary in order for the Securities Administrator to perform the
calculations necessary to make the distributions and allocations contemplated by
Section 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 and to prepare the Distribution Date Statement. The
Securities Administrator shall not be responsible to recompute, recalculate or
verify any information provided to it by the Servicer.

            (b) The amount of Advances to be made by the Servicer for any
Distribution Date shall equal, subject to Section 4.07(d), the sum of (i) the
aggregate amount of Monthly Payments (net of the related Servicing Fee), due
during the related Collection Period in respect of the Mortgage Loans, which
Monthly Payments were delinquent on a contractual basis as of the close of
business on the related Determination Date and (ii) with respect to each REO
Property, which REO Property was acquired during or prior to the related
Collection Period and as to which REO Property an REO Disposition did not occur
during the related Collection Period, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
the REO Imputed Interest on such REO Property for such Collection Period, over
the net income from such REO Property transferred to the Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 3.13 for distribution on such Distribution Date. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, the Monthly Payment on each Balloon Loan
with a delinquent Balloon Payment is equal to the assumed monthly payment that
would have been due on the related Due Date based on the original principal
amortization schedule for such Balloon Loan.

            On or before 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the Servicer Remittance
Date, the Servicer shall remit in immediately available funds to the Securities
Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of Advances, if any, to be made in respect of the Mortgage
Loans for the related Distribution Date either (i) from its own funds or (ii)
from the Collection Account, to the extent of funds held therein for future
distribution (in which case it will cause to be made an appropriate entry in the
records of the Collection Account that amounts held for future distribution have
been, as permitted by this Section 4.07, used by the Servicer in discharge of
any such Advance) or (iii) in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii)
aggregating the total amount of Advances to be made by the Servicer with respect
to the Mortgage Loans. Any amounts held for future distribution and so used
shall be appropriately reflected in the Servicer's records and replaced by the
Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account on or before any future Servicer
Remittance Date to the extent that the Available Funds for the related
Distribution Date (determined without regard to Advances to be made on the
Servicer Remittance Date) shall be less than the total amount that would be
distributed to the Classes of Certificateholders pursuant to Section 4.01 and
4.02 on such Distribution Date if such amounts held for future distributions had
not been so used to make Advances. The Securities Administrator will provide
notice to the Servicer by telecopy by 4:00 p.m. New York City time on any
Servicer Remittance Date in the event that (i) the Servicer fails to remit the
Advances required to be made by the Servicer for the related Distribution Date
or (ii) the amount remitted by the Servicer to the Securities Administrator on
such date is less than the Advances required to be made by the Servicer for the
related Distribution Date, as set forth in the related Remittance Report.

            (c) The obligation of the Servicer to make such Advances is
mandatory, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but subject to
(d) below, and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, shall continue until the
earlier of such time as the Trust acquires title to the related Mortgaged
Property or such Mortgage Loan is paid in full by the Mortgagor or disposed of
by the Trust, or until the recovery of all Liquidation Proceeds thereon.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Advance or
Servicing Advance shall be required to be made hereunder by the Servicer if such
Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance. The determination
by the Servicer that it has made a Nonrecoverable Advance or that any proposed
Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance, shall be evidenced
by an Officers' Certificate of the Servicer delivered to the Securities
Administrator and the Trustee.

            (e) In the event that the Servicer fails to remit any Advances as
required pursuant to this Section 4.07, the Securities Administrator shall
notify the Trustee by 4:00 p.m. on the Servicer Remittance Date identifying for
each Advance the related Mortgage Loan and the amount of the Advance. On or
before 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Distribution Date immediately
following the Servicer Remittance Date, the Trustee shall remit in immediately
available funds to the Securities Administrator such Advances that the Servicer
was required but failed to make for the related Distribution Date; provided that
the Trustee may conclusively rely upon any determination by the Servicer that an
Advance if made would be a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided further that the
Trustee is not obligated to make any Advance that the Trustee, in its good faith
business judgment, determines would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance, such
determination to be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of the Trustee
delivered to the Securities Administrator. So long as the Trustee has not
terminated all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to Section
7.01(b) as a result of a Servicer Event of Termination pursuant to
7.01(a)(i)(A), the Servicer shall pay to the Trustee an amount equal to the
Advance made by the Trustee plus interest at an annual rate equal to Prime Rate,
adjusted as of the date of each change, plus two percentage points, but in no
event greater than the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, on any
Advances made by the Trustee. Such interest shall be solely an obligation of the
Servicer and shall not be payable or reimbursable form any assets of the Trust
Fund.

            Section 4.08 REMIC Distributions.

            (a) On each Distribution Date, the Securities Administrator shall

                  (3) to REMIC 1 Regular Interest LT1ZZ, 1.00% of such
            remainder, until the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC

      Mortgage Loans in the related group of Mortgage Loans over (y) the
      aggregate current Principal Balance of the Class A Certificates in the
      related group of Mortgage Loans (except that if any such excess is a
      larger number than in the preceding distribution period, the least amount
      of principal shall be distributed to such REMIC 1 Regular Interests such
      that the REMIC 1 Subordinated Balance Ratio is maintained); and third, any
      remaining principal to REMIC 1 Regular Interest LT1XX.

                                THE CERTIFICATES

            Section 5.01 The Certificates.

            Each of the Class AI-1A, Class AI-1B, Class AI-2, Class AI-3, Class
AI-4, Class AI-5, Class AI-6, Class AI-7, Class AI-8, Class AI-9, Class AII-1A,
Class AII-1B, Class AIII-1, Class AIII-2, Class AIII-3, Class M-1, Class M-2,
Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6, Class M-7, Class M-8A, Class M-8B,
Class M-9, Class M-10, Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates shall be
substantially in the forms annexed hereto as exhibits, and shall, on original
issue, be executed by the Securities Administrator and authenticated and
delivered by the Certificate Registrar to or upon the receipt of a Written Order
to Authenticate from the Depositor concurrently with the sale and assignment to
the Trustee of the Trust Fund. Each Class of the Certificates (other than the
Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates) shall be initially evidenced by one
or more Certificates representing a Percentage Interest with a minimum dollar
denomination of $25,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The
Class CE and Class P Certificates are issuable only in minimum Percentage
Interests of 10%. The Class R Certificate is issuable only as a single
certificate.

            The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual
or facsimile signature on behalf of the Securities Administrator by a
Responsible Officer. Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
individuals who were, at the time when such signatures were affixed, authorized
to sign on behalf of the Securities Administrator shall bind the Trust,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to be so
authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did
not hold such offices at the date of such Certificate. No Certificate shall be
entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid for any purpose, unless
such Certificate shall have been manually authenticated by the Certificate
Registrar substantially in the form provided for herein, and such authentication
upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that
such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication. Subject to Section
5.02(c), the Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R
Certificates) shall be Book-Entry Certificates. The Class CE, Class P and Class
R Certificates shall not be Book-Entry Certificates but shall be issued in fully
registered certificate form.

            Section 5.02 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.

            (a) The Certificate Registrar shall cause to be kept at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Securities Administrator a Certificate Register in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the
Certificate Registrar shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of
transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The Securities
Administrator shall initially serve as Certificate Registrar for the purpose of
registering Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein
provided. The Securities Administrator as Certificate Registrar shall be subject
to the same standards of care, limitations on liability and rights to indemnity
as the Securities Administrator, and the provisions of Sections 8.01, 8.02,
8.03, 8.04, 8.05, 8.14, 8.15 and 8.16 shall apply to the Certificate Registrar
to the same extent as they apply to the Securities Administrator. Any
Certificate Registrar appointed in accordance with this Section 5.02(a) may at
any time resign by giving at least 30 days' advance written notice of
resignation to the Securities Administrator, the Trustee, the Servicer and the
Depositor, such resignation to become effective upon appointment of a successor
Certificate Registrar.

            Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at
any office or agency of the Certificate Registrar maintained for such purpose
pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and, in the case of the Class R Certificate,
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth below, the Securities
Administrator on behalf of the Trust shall execute and the Certificate Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Certificates of the same aggregate Percentage
Interest.

            At the option of the Certificateholders, Certificates may be
exchanged for other Certificates in authorized denominations and the same
aggregate Percentage Interests, upon surrender of the Certificates to be
exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange, the Securities Administrator shall execute on behalf
of the Trust and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver the
Certificates which the Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to
receive. Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange shall (if so required by the Securities Administrator or the
Certificate Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Securities Administrator and the
Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.

            (b) Upon original issuance, the Book-Entry Certificates shall be
issued in the form of one or more typewritten certificates, to be delivered to
the Depository by, or on behalf of, the Depositor; or to, and deposited with the
Certificate Custodian, on behalf of the Depository, if directed to do so
pursuant to instructions from the Depository. Except as provided in paragraph
(c) below, the Book-Entry Certificates shall at all times remain registered in
the name of the Depository or its nominee and at all times: (i) registration of
such Certificates may not be transferred by the Securities Administrator except
to another Depository; (ii) the Depository shall maintain book-entry records
with respect to the Certificate Owners and with respect to ownership and
transfers of such Certificates; (iii) ownership and transfers of registration of
such Certificates on the books of the Depository shall be governed by applicable
rules established by the Depository; (iv) the Depository may collect its usual
and customary fees, charges and expenses from its Depository Participants; (v)
the Securities Administrator shall for all purposes deal with the Depository as
representative of the Certificate Owners of the Certificates for purposes of
exercising the rights of Holders under this Agreement, and requests and
directions for and votes of such representative shall not be deemed to be
inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Certificate Owners; (vi)
the Securities Administrator may rely and shall be fully protected in relying
upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Depository
Participants and furnished by the Depository Participants with respect to
indirect participating firms and Persons shown on the books of such indirect
participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate Owners; and (vii) the
direct participants of the Depository shall have no rights under this Agreement
under or with respect to any of the Certificates held on their behalf by the
Depository, and the Depository may be treated by the Securities Administrator
and its agents, employees, officers and directors as the absolute owner of the
Certificates for all purposes whatsoever.

            All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates shall
be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository
Participant or brokerage firm representing such Certificate Owners. Each
Depository Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of
Certificate Owners that it represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as
agent in accordance with the Depository's normal procedures. The parties hereto
are hereby authorized to execute a Letter of Representations with the Depository
or take such other action as may be necessary or desirable to register a
Book-Entry Certificate to the Depository. In the event of any conflict between
the terms of any such Letter of Representation and this Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall control.

            (c) If the Depository advises the Securities Administrator in
writing that the Depository is no longer willing or able to discharge properly
its responsibilities as Depository and the Securities Administrator or the
Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor and upon surrender to the
Certificate Registrar of the Book-Entry Certificates by the Depository,
accompanied by registration instructions from the Depository for registration,
the Securities Administrator shall, at the Trust's expense, execute on behalf of
the Trust and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate definitive, fully
registered certificates (the "Definitive Certificates"). None of the Depositor
or the Securities Administrator shall be liable for any delay in delivery of
such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in
relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates, the
Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer, the
Securities Administrator, any Paying Agent and the Depositor shall recognize the
Holders of the Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

            (d) Except with respect to a transfer of the Private Certificates
between or among the Depositor, the Seller, their affiliates or both, no
transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Private Certificate shall be
made unless such disposition is exempt from the registration requirements of the
1933 Act, and any applicable state securities laws or is made in accordance with
the 1933 Act and laws. In the event of any such transfer, (i) unless such
transfer is made in reliance upon Rule 144A (as evidenced by the investment
letter delivered to the Certificate Registrar, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit J-2) under the 1933 Act, the Certificate Registrar
and the Depositor shall require a written Opinion of Counsel (which may be
in-house counsel) acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor that such transfer
may be made pursuant to an exemption, describing the applicable exemption and
the basis therefor, from the 1933 Act or is being made pursuant to the 1933 Act,
which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Certificate Registrar or
the Depositor or (ii) the Certificate Registrar shall require the transferor to
execute a transferor certificate (in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit L) and the transferee to execute an investment letter in substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J-1 or J-2 (in the case of the Class P,
Class CE or Class R Certificates) or in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J-2
(in the case of the Class M-8A, Class M-8B, Class M-9 or Class M-10
Certificates) acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar certifying to the Depositor and the
Certificate Registrar the facts surrounding such transfer, which investment
letter shall not be an expense of the Certificate Registrar or the Depositor.
The Holder of a Private Certificate desiring to effect such transfer shall, and
does hereby agree to, indemnify the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor
against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not
made in accordance with such federal and state laws. For purposes of this
Section 5.02(d) the representations required in any transferor certificate
(substantially in the form of Exhibit L hereto) and any investment letter
(substantially in the form of Exhibit J-2 hereto) shall be deemed to have been
made in connection with the transfer of any Private Certificate that is a
Book-Entry Certificate.

            No transfer of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate shall be made unless
the Certificate Registrar shall have received either (i) a representation from
the transferee of such Certificate, acceptable to and in form and substance
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor, (such requirement
is satisfied only by the Certificate Registrar's receipt of a representation
letter from the transferee substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto, as
appropriate), to the effect that such transferee is not an employee benefit plan
or arrangement subject to Section 406 of ERISA or a plan subject to Section 4975
of the Code or a plan subject to any federal, state or local law ("Similar Law")
materially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or of the Code, nor a
person acting on behalf of any such plan or arrangement nor using the assets of
any such plan or arrangement to effect such transfer or (ii) (except in the case
of the Class R Certificate) in the case of any such ERISA Restricted Certificate
presented for registration in the name of an employee benefit plan subject to
ERISA or a plan or arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Code (or
comparable provisions of any subsequent enactments), or a trustee of any such
plan or any other person acting on behalf of any such plan or arrangement or
using such plan's or arrangement's assets, an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to
the Certificate Registrar, to the effect that the purchase or holding of such
ERISA Restricted Certificate will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction within the meaning of ERISA Section 4975 of the Code on
Similar Law and will not subject the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the
Securities Administrator, the NIMS Insurer or the Certificate Registrar to any
obligation in addition to those expressly undertaken in this Agreement or to any
liability. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, such
representation shall be deemed to have been made to the Certificate Registrar by
the acceptance by a Certificate Owner of the beneficial interest in any such
Class of ERISA-Restricted Certificates, unless the Certificate Registrar shall
have received from the transferee an alternative representation acceptable in
form and substance to the Depositor. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary herein, any purported transfer of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate to or
on behalf of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code
or Similar Law without the delivery to the Certificate Registrar of an Opinion
of Counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar as described above shall be
void and of no effect.

            Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in the
Class R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such
Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to
have irrevocably appointed the Depositor or its designee as its attorney-in-fact
to negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale under clause (v) below and to
execute all instruments of transfer and to do all other things necessary in
connection with any such sale, and the rights of each Person acquiring any
Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the
following provisions:

            (i) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in the
      Class R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall promptly
      notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its
      status as a Permitted Transferee.

            (ii) No Person shall acquire an Ownership Interest in the Class R
      Certificate unless such Ownership Interest is a pro rata undivided
      interest.

            (iii) In connection with any proposed transfer of any Ownership
      Interest in the Class R Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall as a
      condition to registration of the transfer, require delivery to it, in form
      and substance satisfactory to it, of each of the following:

            A. an affidavit in the form of Exhibit K hereto from the proposed
transferee to the effect that, among other things, such transferee is a
Permitted Transferee and that it is not acquiring its Ownership Interest in the
Class R Certificate that is the subject of the proposed transfer as a nominee,
trustee or agent for any Person who is not a Permitted Transferee; and

            B. a covenant of the proposed transferee to the effect that the
proposed transferee agrees to be bound by and to abide by the transfer
restrictions applicable to the Class R Certificate.

            (iv) Any attempted or purported transfer of any Ownership Interest
      in the Class R Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section
      shall be absolutely null and void and shall vest no rights in the
      purported transferee. If any purported transferee shall, in violation of
      the provisions of this Section, become the Holder of the Class R
      Certificate, then the prior Holder of such Class R Certificate that is a
      Permitted Transferee shall, upon discovery that the registration of
      transfer of such Class R Certificate was not in fact permitted by this
      Section, be restored to all rights as Holder thereof retroactive to the
      date of registration of transfer of such Class R Certificate. The
      Certificate Registrar shall be under no liability to any Person for any
      registration of transfer of the Class R Certificate that is in fact not
      permitted by this Section or for making any distributions due on such
      Class R Certificate to the Holder thereof or taking any other action with
      respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement so long as
      the Certificate Registrar received the documents specified in clause
      (iii). The Securities Administrator shall be entitled to recover from any
      Holder of the Class R Certificate that was in fact not a Permitted
      Transferee at the time such distributions were made all distributions made
      on such Class R Certificate. Any such distributions so recovered by the
      Securities Administrator shall be distributed and delivered by the
      Securities Administrator to the prior Holder of such Class R Certificate
      that is a Permitted Transferee.

            (v) If any Person other than a Disqualified Organization acquires
      any Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate in violation of the
      restrictions in this Section, then the Certificate Registrar shall have
      the right but not the obligation, without notice to the Holder of the
      Class R Certificate or any other Person having an Ownership Interest
      therein, to notify the Depositor to arrange for the sale of the Class R
      Certificate. The proceeds of such sale, net of commissions (which may
      include commissions payable to the Depositor or its affiliates in
      connection with such sale), expenses and taxes due, if any, will be
      remitted by the Securities Administrator to the previous Holder of the
      Class R Certificate that is a Permitted Transferee, except that in the
      event that the Securities Administrator determines that the Holder of the
      Class R Certificate may be liable for any amount due under this Section or
      any other provisions of this Agreement, the Securities Administrator may
      withhold a corresponding amount from such remittance as security for such
      claim. The terms and conditions of any sale under this clause (v) shall be
      determined in the sole discretion of the Securities Administrator and it
      shall not be liable to any Person having an Ownership Interest in the
      Class R Certificate as a result of its exercise of such discretion.

            (vi) If any Person other than a Permitted Transferee acquires any
      Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate in violation of the
      restrictions in this Section, then the Securities Administrator will
      provide to the Internal Revenue Service, and to the persons specified in
      Sections 860E(e)(3) and (6) of the Code, information needed to compute the
      tax imposed under Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code on transfers of residual
      interests to disqualified organizations. The Securities Administrator
      shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for providing such
      information from the person to whom it is provided.

The foregoing provisions of this Section shall cease to apply to transfers
occurring on or after the date on which there shall have been delivered to the
Certificate Registrar, in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate
Registrar, (i) written notification from each Rating Agency that the removal of
the restrictions on Transfer set forth in this Section will not cause such
Rating Agency to downgrade its rating of the Certificates and (ii) an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such removal will not cause any REMIC hereunder to
fail to qualify as a REMIC.

            (e) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates of any Class, but the Certificate Registrar may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            All Certificates surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be cancelled by the Certificate Registrar and disposed of
pursuant to its standard procedures.

            Section 5.03 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

            If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate
Registrar or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate and (ii) there is delivered to
the Securities Administrator, the Trustee, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and
the Certificate Registrar such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Securities
Administrator or the Certificate Registrar that such Certificate has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Securities Administrator shall execute on
behalf of the Trust, and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and Percentage Interest.
Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Securities
Administrator or the Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar) in connection therewith.
Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section, shall constitute
complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust, as if originally
issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found
at any time.

            Section 5.04 Persons Deemed Owners.

            The Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator, the NIMS Insurer, the Certificate Registrar, any Paying Agent and
any agent of the Servicer, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Securities
Administrator, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any Paying Agent may
treat the Person, including a Depository, in whose name any Certificate is
registered as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions pursuant to Section 4.01 and 4.02 and for all other purposes
whatsoever, and none of the Servicer, the Trust, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator, the NIMS Insurer nor any agent of any of them shall be affected
by notice to the contrary.

            Section 5.05 Appointment of Paying Agent.

            The Paying Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from
the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 4.01 and 4.02 and shall report the
amounts of such distributions to the Securities Administrator. The duties of the
Paying Agent may include the obligation to distribute statements and provide
information to Certificateholders as required hereunder. The Paying Agent
hereunder shall at all times be an entity duly incorporated and validly existing
under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, authorized
under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or
examination by federal or state authorities. The Paying Agent shall initially be
the Securities Administrator. The Securities Administrator may appoint a
successor to act as Paying Agent, which appointment shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer and the Rating Agencies. The
Securities Administrator as Paying Agent shall be subject to the same standards
of care, limitations on liability and rights to indemnity as the Securities
Administrator, and the provisions of Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, 8.04, 8.05,
8.14, 8.15 and 8.16 shall apply to the Paying Agent to the same extent as they
apply to the Securities Administrator. Any Paying Agent appointed in accordance
with this Section 5.05 may at any time resign by giving at least 30 days'
advance written notice of resignation to the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator, the Servicer, the NIMS Insurer and the Depositor, such
resignation to become effective upon appointment of a successor Paying Agent.

                         THE SERVICER AND THE DEPOSITOR

            Section 6.01 Liability of the Servicer and the Depositor.

            The Servicer shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the
extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the
Servicer herein. The Depositor shall be liable in accordance herewith only to
the extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the
Depositor.

            Section 6.02 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the
Obligations of, the Servicer or the Depositor.

            Any entity into which the Servicer or the Depositor may be merged or
consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer or the Depositor shall be a party, or any
organization succeeding to the business of the Servicer or the Depositor, shall
be the successor of the Servicer or the Depositor, as the case may be,
hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that the successor servicer shall satisfy
all the requirements of Section 7.02 with respect to the qualifications of a
successor servicer.

            Section 6.03 Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others.

            Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or
employees or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Trust or
the Certificateholders for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of
any action by the Servicer in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for
errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the
Servicer or any such Person against any liability which would otherwise be
imposed by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in
the performance of duties of the Servicer or by reason of its reckless disregard
of its obligations and duties of the Servicer hereunder. The Servicer and any
director or officer or employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith
on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any
Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Servicer and any director
or officer or employee or agent of the Servicer shall be indemnified by the
Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred in
connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement or the Certificates,
other than any loss, liability or expense related to any specific Mortgage Loan
or Mortgage Loans (except as any such loss, liability or expense shall be
otherwise reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement) and any loss, liability or
expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of its reckless
disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. The Servicer may undertake any
such action which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this
Agreement, and the rights and duties of the parties hereto and the interests of
the Certificateholders hereunder. In such event, the reasonable legal expenses
and costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom shall be
expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust and the Servicer shall be entitled
to be reimbursed therefor pursuant to Section 3.05. The Servicer's right to
indemnity or reimbursement pursuant to this Section shall survive any
resignation or termination of the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04 or 7.01 with
respect to any losses, expenses, costs or liabilities arising prior to such
resignation or termination (or arising from events that occurred prior to such
resignation or termination). This paragraph shall apply to the Servicer solely
in its capacity as Servicer hereunder and in no other capacities.

Section 6.04      Servicer Not to Resign.

            Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 6.02, the
Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it
except (i) upon determination that the performance of its obligations or duties
hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material
conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried on by it
or its subsidiaries or Affiliates, the other activities of the Servicer so
causing such a conflict being of a type and nature carried on by the Servicer or
its subsidiaries or Affiliates at the date of this Agreement or (ii) upon
satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) the Servicer has proposed a
successor servicer to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator in writing
and such proposed successor servicer is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and
the Securities Administrator; and (b) each Rating Agency shall have delivered a
letter to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator prior to the appointment
of the successor servicer stating that the proposed appointment of such
successor servicer as Servicer hereunder will not result in the reduction or
withdrawal of the then current rating of the Regular Certificates or the ratings
that are in effect; provided, however, that no such resignation by the Servicer
shall become effective until such successor servicer or, in the case of (i)
above, the Trustee shall have assumed the Servicer's responsibilities and
obligations hereunder or the Trustee shall have designated a successor servicer
in accordance with Section 7.02. Any such resignation shall not relieve the
Servicer of responsibility for any of the obligations specified in Sections 7.01
and 7.02 as obligations that survive the resignation or termination of the
Servicer. Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer
shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the
Trustee and the Securities Administrator.

            Section 6.05 Delegation of Duties.

            In the ordinary course of business, the Servicer at any time may
delegate any of its duties hereunder to any Person, including any of its
Affiliates, who agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with standards
comparable to those set forth in Section 3.01. Such delegation shall not relieve
the Servicer of its liabilities and responsibilities with respect to such duties
and shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section 6.04. The
Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Rating Agencies with 60 days prior
written notice prior to the delegation of any of its duties to any Person other
than any of the Servicer's Affiliates or their respective successors and
assigns.

                                     DEFAULT

            Section 7.01 Servicer Events of Termination.

            (a) If any one of the following events ("Servicer Events of
Termination") shall occur and be continuing:

            (i) (A) The failure by the Servicer to make any Advance, Servicing
      Advance or to pay Compensating Interest and such failure described in this
      clause (A) continues unremedied until 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the
      Business Day immediately following the Distribution Date following such
      failure; or

                  (B) any other failure by the Servicer to deposit in the
Collection Account or Distribution Account any deposit required to be made under
the terms of this Agreement, which failure described in this clause (B)
continues unremedied for a period of three Business Days after the first date on
which written notice of such failure is given to the Servicer; or

            (ii) The failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform, in any
      material respect, any other covenants, obligations or agreements of the
      Servicer as set forth in this Agreement, which failure continues
      unremedied for a period of 60 days, after the date (A) on which written
      notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been
      given to the Servicer by the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or by
      any Holder of a Regular Certificate evidencing at least 25% of the Voting
      Interests or (B) actual knowledge of such failure by a Servicing Officer
      of the Servicer; or

            (iii) The entry against the Servicer of a decree or order by a court
      or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises for
      the appointment of a trustee, conservator, receiver or liquidator in any
      insolvency, conservatorship, receivership, readjustment of debt,
      marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the
      winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such
      decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 days; or

            (iv) The Servicer shall voluntarily go into liquidation, consent to
      the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or similar
      person in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and
      liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to the Servicer or of or
      relating to all or substantially all of its property; or a decree or order
      of a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the
      premises for the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator or
      similar person in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of
      assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or
      liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Servicer
      and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged,
      unbonded or unstayed for a period of 60 days; or the Servicer shall admit
      in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due,
      file a petition to take advantage of any applicable insolvency or
      reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its
      creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations; or

            (v) the Servicer becoming ineligible to service for both Fannie Mae
      and Freddie Mac (unless remedied within 90 days).

            (b) Then, and in each and every such case, so long as a Servicer
Event of Termination shall not have been remedied within the applicable grace
period, (x) with respect solely to clause (i)(A) above, if such Advance is not
made by 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the Business Day immediately following
the Distribution Date, the Trustee may terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Trustee shall assume
upon such termination (or, pursuant to Section 4.07(e), prior to such
termination in the case of the obligation to make Advances), pursuant to Section
7.02, the duties of a successor servicer (including, but not limited to, the
duty to make Advances required pursuant to this Agreement) and (y) in the case
of (i)(B), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) above, the Trustee shall, at the direction
of the NIMS Insurer or Holders of each Class of Regular Certificates evidencing
Voting Interests aggregating not less than 66 2/3%, by notice then given in
writing to the Servicer (and to the Trustee if given by Holders of
Certificates), terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer as
servicer under this Agreement. Any such notice to the Servicer shall also be
given to the Securities Administrator, each Rating Agency, the NIMS Insurer and
the Depositor. On or after the receipt by the Servicer (and by the Trustee if
such notice is given by the Holders) of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Certificates or the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in
the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section or successor servicer appointed
in connection with Section 7.02; and, without limitation, the Trustee or
successor servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents
and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination,
whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of each Mortgage Loan and
Related Documents or otherwise. The Servicer agrees to cooperate with the
Trustee (or the applicable successor servicer) in effecting the termination of
the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer hereunder, including, without
limitation, the delivery to the Trustee (or the applicable successor servicer)
of all documents and records requested by it to enable it to assume the
Servicer's functions under this Agreement within twenty Business Days subsequent
to such notice, the transfer within two Business Days subsequent to such notice
to the Trustee (or the applicable successor servicer) for the administration by
it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the Servicer and to be
deposited by it in the Collection Account, the Distribution Account or any
Escrow Account or that have been deposited by the Servicer in such accounts or
thereafter received by the Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans or any
REO Property received by the Servicer. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with transferring
the servicing to the successor servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect
such succession as Servicer pursuant to this Section shall be paid by the
predecessor servicer (or if the predecessor servicer is the Trustee, the initial
servicer) upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and
expenses, and if such predecessor Servicer defaults in its obligation to pay
such costs, such costs shall be paid by the successor Servicer or the Trustee
(in which case the successor Servicer or the Trustee shall be entitled to
reimbursement therefor from the assets of the Trust).

            Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of a Servicer
hereunder, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive payment of all accrued and
unpaid Servicing Fees and reimbursement for all outstanding Advances and
Servicing Advances properly made prior to the date of termination.

            Section 7.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

            (a) Within 90 days of the time the Servicer (and the Trustee, if
notice is sent by the Holders) receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.01 or 6.04, the Trustee (or such other successor servicer as is
approved in accordance with this Agreement) shall be the successor in all
respects to the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and
the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all
the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the
Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof arising on and after its succession.
As compensation therefor, the Trustee (or such other successor servicer) shall
be entitled to such compensation as the Servicer would have been entitled to
hereunder if no such notice of termination had been given. Notwithstanding the
above, (i) if the Trustee is unwilling to act as successor servicer or (ii) if
the Trustee is legally unable so to act, the Trustee shall appoint or petition a
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established housing and home
finance institution, bank or other mortgage loan or home equity loan servicer
having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 as the successor to the Servicer
hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties
or liabilities of the Servicer hereunder; provided, that the appointment of any
such successor servicer will not result in the qualification, reduction or
withdrawal of the ratings assigned to the Certificates or the ratings that are
in effect by the Rating Agencies as evidenced by a letter to such effect from
the Rating Agencies. Pending appointment of a successor to the Servicer
hereunder, unless the Trustee is prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee
shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided. In connection with such
appointment and assumption, the successor shall be entitled to receive
compensation out of payments on Mortgage Loans in an amount equal to the
compensation which the Servicer would otherwise have received pursuant to
Section 3.18 (or such other compensation as the Trustee and such successor shall
agree, not to exceed the Servicing Fee). The successor servicer shall be
entitled to withdraw from the Collection Account all costs and expenses
associated with the transfer of the servicing to the successor servicer,
including costs and expenses of the Trustee. The appointment of a successor
servicer shall not affect any liability of the predecessor servicer which may
have arisen under this Agreement prior to its termination as Servicer to pay any
deductible under an insurance policy pursuant to Section 3.11 or to indemnify
the parties indicated in Section 3.24 pursuant to the terms thereof, nor shall
any successor servicer be liable for any acts or omissions of the predecessor
servicer or for any breach by such servicer of any of its representations or
warranties contained herein or in any related document or agreement. The Trustee
and such successor shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as
shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

            (b) Any successor, including the Trustee, to the Servicer as
servicer shall during the term of its service as servicer continue to service
and administer the Mortgage Loans for the benefit of Certificateholders, and
maintain in force a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and
omissions in the performance of its obligations as Servicer hereunder and a
Fidelity Bond in respect of its officers, employees and agents to the same
extent as the Servicer is so required pursuant to Section 3.12.

            Section 7.03 Waiver of Defaults.

            The Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 66 2/3% of the
Voting Interests allocated to the Classes of Certificates affected by a Servicer
Event of Termination may, on behalf of all Certificateholders, waive any events
permitting removal of the Servicer as servicer pursuant to this Article VII,
provided, however, that such Holders may not waive a default in making a
required distribution on a Certificate without the consent of the Holder of such
Certificate. Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to
exist and any Servicer Event of Termination arising therefrom shall be deemed to
have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereto
except to the extent expressly so waived. Notice of any such waiver shall be
given by the Trustee to the Securities Administrator and the Rating Agencies.

            Section 7.04 Notification to Certificateholders.

            (a) On any termination or appointment of a successor to the Servicer
pursuant to this Article VII or Section 6.04, the Trustee shall give prompt
written notice thereof to the Securities Administrator and the
Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Certificate
Register and each Rating Agency.

            (b) No later than 60 days after the occurrence of any event which
constitutes or which, with notice or a lapse of time or both, would constitute a
Servicer Event of Termination for five Business Days after a Responsible Officer
of the Trustee becomes aware of the occurrence of such an event, the Trustee
shall transmit by mail to the Securities Administrator and all
Certificateholders notice of such occurrence unless such default or Servicer
Event of Termination shall have been waived or cured. Such notice shall be given
to the Rating Agencies promptly after any such occurrence.

            Section 7.05 Survival of Servicer Liabilities.

            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon termination of
the Servicer hereunder, any liabilities of the Servicer which accrued prior to
such termination shall survive such termination.

                  THE TRUSTEE AND THE SECURITIES ADMINISTRATOR

            Section 8.01 Duties of Trustee and Securities Administrator.

            The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
Termination of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual
knowledge and after the curing of all Servicer Events of Termination which may
have occurred, and the Securities Administrator, each undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement as
duties of the Trustee and the Securities Administrator, respectively. If a
Servicer Event of Termination has occurred (which has not been cured), of which
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has knowledge, the Trustee shall exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and use the same
degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise
or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

            Upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions,
reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the Trustee and the
Securities Administrator which are specifically required to be furnished
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, the Trustee and the Securities
Administrator shall examine them to determine whether they conform to the
requirements of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither the Trustee or
the Securities Administrator shall be responsible for the accuracy or content of
any resolution, certificate, statement, opinion, report, document, order or
other instrument furnished by the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor
hereunder. If any such instrument is found not to conform in any material
respect to the requirements of this Agreement, the Trustee shall notify the
Certificateholders of such instrument in the event that the Trustee, after so
requesting, does not receive a satisfactorily corrected instrument.

            No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee and the Securities Administrator from liability for its own negligent
action, its own negligent failure to act or its own misconduct; provided,
however, that:

            (i) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination, and
      after the curing of all such Servicer Events of Termination which may have
      occurred, the duties and obligations of the Trustee and the Securities
      Administrator shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
      Agreement, neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are
      specifically set forth in this Agreement, no implied covenants or
      obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee and the
      Securities Administrator and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of
      the Trustee or the Securities Administrator, the Trustee or the Securities
      Administrator, as the case may be, may conclusively rely, as to the truth
      of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein,
      upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee or the
      Securities Administrator and conforming to the requirements of this
      Agreement;

            (ii) neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      personally liable for an error of judgment made in good faith by a
      Responsible Officer of the Trustee or the Securities Administrator, unless
      it shall be proved that the Trustee or the Securities Administrator,
      respectively, was negligent in ascertaining or investigating the facts
      related thereto;

            (iii) neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      personally liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to
      be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the
      Majority Certificateholders relating to the time, method and place of
      conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or the
      Securities Administrator or exercising or omitting to exercise any trust
      or power conferred upon the Trustee or the Securities Administrator under
      this Agreement; and

            (iv) neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      charged with knowledge of any failure by the Servicer to comply with the
      obligations of the Servicer referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section
      7.01(a) or any Servicer Event of Termination unless a Responsible Officer
      of the Trustee or the Securities Administrator obtains actual knowledge of
      such failure or the Trustee or the Securities Administrator receives
      written notice of such failure from the Servicer or the Majority
      Certificateholders.

            Neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability
in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is
not reasonably assured to it, and none of the provisions contained in this
Agreement shall in any event require the Trustee or the Securities Administrator
to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance of, any of the
obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement, except during such time, if
any, as the Securities Administrator shall be the successor to, and be vested
with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

            Section 8.02 Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee and the
Securities Administrator.

            (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

            (i) the Trustee and the Securities Administrator may request and
      rely upon, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting
      upon, any resolution, Officer's Certificate, certificate of auditors or
      any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
      request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document
      reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
      presented by the proper party or parties;

            (ii) the Trustee and the Securities Administrator may consult with
      counsel and any advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
      authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or
      omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice
      or Opinion of Counsel;

            (iii) neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it
      by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation
      hereunder or in relation hereto, at the request, order or direction of the
      Certificateholders or the NIMS Insurer pursuant to the provisions of this
      Agreement, unless such Certificateholders or the NIMS Insurer shall have
      offered to the Trustee or the Securities Administrator, as the case may
      be, reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and
      liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; the right of the
      Trustee or the Securities Administrator, as the case may be, to perform
      any discretionary act enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed
      as a duty, and neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall
      be answerable for other than its negligence or willful misconduct in the
      performance of any such act;

            (iv) neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      personally liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good
      faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or
      rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement;

            (v) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination and
      after the curing of all Servicer Events of Termination which may have
      occurred, neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
      resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
      request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or documents,
      unless requested in writing to do so by the Majority Certificateholders or
      the NIMS Insurer; provided, however, that if the payment within a
      reasonable time to the Trustee or the Securities Administrator of the
      costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making
      of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Securities
      Administrator, not reasonably assured to the Trustee or the Securities
      Administrator by the security afforded to it by the terms of this
      Agreement, the Trustee and the Securities Administrator may require
      reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or liability as a
      condition to such proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such
      examination shall be paid by the Servicer or, if paid by the Trustee or
      the Securities Administrator, shall be reimbursed by the Servicer upon
      demand. Nothing in this clause (v) shall derogate from the obligation of
      the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of
      information regarding the Mortgagors;

            (vi) neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall be
      accountable, have any liability or make any representation as to any acts
      or omissions hereunder of the Servicer until such time as the Trustee may
      be required to act as Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02;

            (vii) each of the Trustee and the Securities Administrator may
      execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties
      hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys or a
      custodian and neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall
      be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such
      agent, attorney or custodian appointed by it with due care; and

            (viii) the right of the Trustee or the Securities Administrator to
      perform any discretionary act enumerated in this Agreement shall not be
      construed as a duty, and neither the Trustee nor the Securities
      Administrator shall be answerable for other than its negligence or willful
      misconduct in the performance of such act.

            Section 8.03 Trustee and Securities Administrator Not Liable for
Certificates or Mortgage Loans.

            The recitals contained herein and in the Certificates (other than
the authentication of the Trustee on the Certificates) shall be taken as the
statements of the Depositor, and neither the Trustee nor the Securities
Administrator assumes any responsibility for the correctness of the same.
Neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator makes any representations
as to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or of the Certificates
(other than the signature and authentication of the Securities Administrator on
the Certificates, in the case of the Securities Administrator) or of any
Mortgage Loan or Related Document. Neither the Trustee nor the Securities
Administrator shall be accountable for the use or application by the Servicer,
or for the use or application of any funds paid to the Servicer in respect of
the Mortgage Loans or deposited in or withdrawn from the Collection Account by
the Servicer. Neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator shall at any
time have any responsibility or liability for or with respect to the legality,
validity and enforceability of any Mortgage or any Mortgage Loan, or the
perfection and priority of any Mortgage or the maintenance of any such
perfection and priority, or for or with respect to the sufficiency of the Trust
or its ability to generate the payments to be distributed to Certificateholders
under this Agreement, including, without limitation: the existence, condition
and ownership of any Mortgaged Property; the existence and enforceability of any
hazard insurance thereon (other than the Trustee's responsibility if the Trustee
shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); the validity
of the assignment of any Mortgage Loan to the Trustee or of any intervening
assignment; the completeness of any Mortgage Loan; the performance or
enforcement of any Mortgage Loan (other than the Trustee's responsibility if the
Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); the
compliance by the Depositor or the Servicer with any warranty or representation
made under this Agreement or in any related document or the accuracy of any such
warranty or representation (except, in the case of the Trustee, after receipt of
notice of any non-compliance therewith or any breach thereof); any investment of
monies by or at the direction of the Servicer or any loss resulting therefrom,
it being understood that the Trustee shall remain responsible for any Trust
property that it may hold in its individual capacity; the acts or omissions of
any of the Servicer (other than the Trustee's responsibility if the Trustee
shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02), or any
Mortgagor; any action of the Servicer (other than the Trustee's responsibility
if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section
7.02), taken in the name of the Trust; the failure of the Servicer to act or
perform any duties required of it as agent of the Trust hereunder (other than
the Trustee's responsibility if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the
Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); or any action by the Trustee or the
Securities Administrator taken at the instruction of the Servicer (other than
the Trustee's responsibility if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the
Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not relieve the Trustee and the Securities Administrator of their obligation to
perform their respective duties under this Agreement. The Trustee shall have no
responsibility for filing any financing or continuation statement in any public
office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any
security interest or lien granted to it hereunder.

            Section 8.04 Trustee and Securities Administrator May Own
Certificates.

            Each of the Trustee and the Securities Administrator in its
individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates
with the same rights as it would have if it were not Trustee or Securities
Administrator and may transact any banking and trust business with the Servicer,
the Depositor or their Affiliates.

            Section 8.05 Trustee and Securities Administrator Fees and Expenses.

            The Securities Administrator shall be entitled to the investment
income on funds on deposit in the Distribution Account as set forth in Section
3.23. This shall constitute compensation to the Securities Administrator for its
activities hereunder. The fees and expenses of the Trustee shall be paid in
accordance with a side letter agreement between the Trustee and the Securities
Administrator. The Trust shall reimburse the Trustee and the Securities
Administrator for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred
or made by the Trustee or the Securities Administrator in accordance with any of
the provisions of this Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the
expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all persons not regularly in
its employ), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from
its gross negligence or bad faith or which is the responsibility of the Trustee
or Securities Administrator hereunder or that does not constitute an
"unanticipated expense" of the REMIC within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.860G(b)(3)(ii). In addition, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator
and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents shall be
indemnified by the Trust from, and held harmless against, any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims or expenses incurred in connection with any legal
action relating to this Agreement or the Certificates, other than any loss,
liability or expense (i) that constitutes a specific liability of the Trustee or
the Securities Administrator, as applicable, under this Agreement, (ii) incurred
by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of the Trustee
or Securities Administrator, as applicable, in the performance of its respective
duties hereunder or by reason of the Trustee's or the Securities
Administrator's, as the case may be, reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties hereunder or (iii) that does not constitute an "unanticipated expense" of
the REMIC within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G(b)(3)(ii).
The Trustee and its officers, directors, employees and agents shall be
indemnified by the Trust from, and held harmless against, any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Custodian in any way
related to or arising out of the Custodial Agreement or any action taken or not
taken by the Custodian and which the Trustee had paid to the Custodian pursuant
to the terms of the Custodial Agreement, other than any loss, liability or
expense (i) that constitutes a specific liability of the Custodian under the
Custodial Agreement or (ii) or incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence of the Custodian in the performance of its duties under the
Custodial Agreement or by reason of the Custodian's reckless disregard of its
obligations under the Custodial Agreement. Subject to the provisions of this
Article VIII, the Trustee and its officers, directors, employees and agents
shall be indemnified by the Securities Administrator from, and held harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims or expenses incurred
by the Trustee in connection with or arising out of the willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence of the Securities Administrator in the performance of its
duties under this Agreement or by reason of the Securities Administrator's
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. Subject
to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Securities Administrator and its
officers, directors, employees and agents shall be indemnified by the Trustee
from, and held harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims or expenses incurred by the Securities Administrator in connection with
or arising out of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Trustee in
the performance of its duties under this Agreement or by reason of the Trustee's
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. This
Section shall survive termination of this Agreement or the resignation or
removal of any Trustee or Securities Administrator hereunder.

            Section 8.06 Eligibility Requirements for Trustee and Securities
Administrator.

            Each of the Trustee and the Securities Administrator shall at all
times be (i) an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
United States of America or any state thereof, authorized under such laws to
exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $50,000,000 or a member of a bank holding system, the aggregate combined
capital surplus of which is at least $50,000,000, provided that its separate
capital and surplus shall at all times be at least the amount specified in
Section 310(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, (ii) be subject to
supervision or examination by federal or state authority and (iii) have a
minimum long-term debt rating of BBB by Fitch and S&P and Baa3 by Moody's and a
long term debt rating of at least A1 or better by Moody's, and subject to
supervision or examination by federal or state authority. The Trustee shall not
be an affiliate of the Depositor or the Servicer. If such entity publishes
reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements
of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of
this Section 8.06, the combined capital and surplus of such entity shall be
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. The principal office of the Trustee and the
Securities Administrator (other than the initial Trustee or Securities
Administrator) shall be in a state with respect to which an Opinion of Counsel
has been delivered to such Trustee or Securities Administrator at the time such
Trustee or Securities Administrator is appointed Trustee or Securities
Administrator, at such entity's expense, to the effect that the Trust will not
be a taxable entity under the laws of such state. In case at any time the
Trustee or Securities Administrator shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.06, the Trustee or Securities
Administrator shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
specified in Section 8.07. The Securities Administrator (i) may not be the
Originator, the Servicer, the Depositor or an affiliate of the Depositor unless
the Securities Administrator is in an institutional trust department, (ii) must
be authorized to exercise corporate trust powers under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, and (iii) must be rated at least "A/F1" by Fitch
and "A-1" by S&P, if Fitch and S&P, as applicable, is a Rating Agency, or the
equivalent rating by Moody's (or such other rating acceptable to Fitch and S&P
pursuant to a ratings confirmation). If no successor Securities Administrator
shall have been appointed and shall have accepted appointment within 60 days
after the Securities Administrator ceases to be the Securities Administrator
pursuant to this Section 8.06, then the Trustee shall perform the duties of the
Securities Administrator pursuant to this Agreement. The Trustee shall notify
the Rating Agencies of any change of Securities Administrator.

            Section 8.07 Resignation or Removal of Trustee and Securities
Administrator.

            The Trustee or the Securities Administrator may at any time resign
and be discharged from the trusts hereby created by giving written notice
thereof to the Depositor, the Servicer, the NIMS Insurer and each Rating Agency.
Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Depositor shall promptly appoint
a successor Trustee or Securities Administrator, as applicable, reasonably
acceptable to the NIMS Insurer by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of
which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee or Securities
Administrator, as applicable, and one copy to the successor Trustee or
Securities Administrator, as the case may be. If no successor Trustee or
Securities Administrator shall have been so appointed and having accepted
appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Trustee or Securities Administrator may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee or Securities
Administrator.

            If at any time the Trustee or the Securities Administrator shall
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.06 and shall
fail to resign after written request therefor by the Depositor, or if at any
time the Trustee or the Securities Administrator shall be legally unable to act,
or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or
the Securities Administrator or of its property shall be appointed, or any
public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or the Securities
Administrator or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation, then the Depositor may remove the Trustee or the
Securities Administrator, as the case may be. If the Depositor or the Servicer
removes the Trustee or the Securities Administrator under the authority of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor
Trustee or Securities Administrator by written instrument, in duplicate, one
copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee or Securities
Administrator so removed and one copy to the successor Trustee or Securities
Administrator.

            The Majority Certificateholders or the NIMS Insurer may at any time
remove the Trustee or the Securities Administrator by written instrument or
instruments delivered to the Servicer, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the
Securities Administrator and the Trustee; the Depositor shall thereupon use its
best efforts to appoint a successor Trustee or Securities Administrator, as the
case may be, reasonably acceptable to the NIMS Insurer in accordance with this
Section.

            Any resignation or removal of the Trustee or the Securities
Administrator and appointment of a successor Trustee or Securities Administrator
pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 8.07 shall not become
effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee or Securities
Administrator as provided in Section 8.08.

            Section 8.08 Successor Trustee and Successor Securities
Administrator.

            Any successor Trustee or Securities Administrator appointed as
provided in Section 8.07 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the
Depositor, the Rating Agencies, the Servicer and to its predecessor Trustee or
Securities Administrator an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and
thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee or Securities
Administrator shall become effective, and such successor Trustee or Securities
Administrator, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully
vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee or Securities
Administrator. The Depositor, the Servicer and the predecessor Trustee or
Securities Administrator shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such
other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and
confirming in the successor Trustee or Securities Administrator all such rights,
powers, duties and obligations.

            No successor Trustee or Securities Administrator shall accept
appointment as provided in this Section 8.08 unless at the time of such
acceptance such successor Trustee or Securities Administrator shall be eligible
under the provisions of Section 8.06 and the appointment of such successor
Trustee or Securities Administrator shall not result in a downgrading of the
Regular Certificates by any Rating Agency, as evidenced by a letter from each
Rating Agency.

            Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee or Securities
Administrator as provided in this Section 8.08, the successor Trustee or
Securities Administrator shall mail notice of the appointment of a successor
Trustee or Securities Administrator hereunder to all Holders of Certificates at
their addresses as shown in the Certificate Register and to each Rating Agency.

            Section 8.09 Merger or Consolidation of Trustee or Securities
Administrator.

            Any entity into which the Trustee or the Securities Administrator
may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee or
the Securities Administrator shall be a party, or any entity succeeding to the
business of the Trustee or the Securities Administrator, shall be the successor
of the Trustee or Securities Administrator hereunder, provided such entity shall
be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 and 8.08, without the execution
or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

            Section 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time,
for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which
any part of the Trust or any Mortgaged Property may at the time be located, the
Depositor and the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute
and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the
Trustee and the NIMS Insurer to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with
the Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the
Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, such title to the Trust, or any part thereof,
and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.10, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Servicer and the Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. Any such co-trustee or separate trustee shall be subject
to the written approval of the Servicer and the NIMS Insurer. If the Servicer
and the NIMS Insurer shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days
after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or in the case a Servicer Event
of Termination shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall
have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee
hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor
Trustee under Section 8.06, and no notice to Certificateholders of the
appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required under
Section 8.08.

            Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:

            (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
      upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
      performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly
      (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not
      authorized to act separately without the Trustee joining in such act),
      except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any
      particular act or acts are to be performed, the Trustee shall be
      incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event
      such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of
      title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall
      be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee,
      but solely at the direction of the Trustee;

            (ii) no trustee hereunder shall be held personally liable by reason
      of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

            (iii) the Securities Administrator and the Trustee, acting jointly
      may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee
      or co-trustee.

            Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees,
as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance
of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified
in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately,
as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and a copy thereof given to the
Depositor, the Securities Administrator, the Rating Agencies and the Servicer.

            Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time, constitute the
Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor Trustee.

            Section 8.11 Limitation of Liability.

            The Certificates are executed by the Securities Administrator, not
in its individual capacity but solely as Securities Administrator of the Trust,
in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred and vested in it by this
Agreement. Each of the undertakings and agreements made on the part of the
Securities Administrator in the Certificates is made and intended not as a
personal undertaking or agreement by the Securities Administrator but is made
and intended for the purpose of binding only the Trust.

            Section 8.12 Trustee or Securities Administrator May Enforce Claims
Without Possession of Certificates.

            (a) All rights of action and claims under this Agreement or the
Certificates may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee or the Securities
Administrator without the possession of any of the Certificates or the
production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and such proceeding
instituted by the Trustee or the Securities Administrator shall be brought in
its own name or in its capacity as Trustee or Securities Administrator for the
benefit of all Holders of such Certificates, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement. Any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursement and advances of the Trustee
or Securities Administrator, as the case may be, or their agents and counsel, be
for the ratable benefit of the Certificateholders in respect of which such
judgment has been recovered.

            (b) The Trustee shall afford the Depositor, the Servicer, the
Securities Administrator and each Certificateholder upon reasonable notice
during normal business hours, access to all records maintained by the Trustee in
respect of its duties hereunder and access to officers of the Trustee
responsible for performing such duties. The Trustee shall cooperate fully with
the NIMS Insurer, the Servicer, the Depositor, the Securities Administrator and
such Certificateholder and shall make available to the Servicer, the Depositor,
the Securities Administrator and such Certificateholder for review and copying
at the expense of the party requesting such copies, such books, documents or
records as may be requested with respect to the Trustee's duties hereunder. The
Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the
Certificateholders shall not have any responsibility or liability for any action
or failure to act by the Trustee and are not obligated to supervise the
performance of the Trustee under this Agreement or otherwise.

            (c) The Securities Administrator shall afford the Depositor, the
Trustee, the Servicer, the NIMS Insurer and each Certificateholder upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, access to all records maintained
by the Securities Administrator in respect of its duties hereunder and access to
officers of the Securities Administrator responsible for performing such duties.
The Securities Administrator shall cooperate fully with the Servicer, the
Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Depositor and such Certificateholder and shall
make available to the Servicer, the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Depositor and
such Certificateholder for review and copying at the expense of the party
requesting such copies, such books, documents or records as may be requested
with respect to the Securities Administrator's duties hereunder. The Depositor,
the Trustee, the Servicer, the NIMS Insurer and the Certificateholders shall not
have any responsibility or liability for any action or failure to act by the
Securities Administrator and are not obligated to supervise the performance of
the Securities Administrator under this Agreement or otherwise.

            Section 8.13 Suits for Enforcement.

            In case a Servicer Event of Termination or other default by the
Servicer hereunder shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee may proceed to
protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Certificateholders under
this Agreement by a suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law or otherwise,
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or in aid of the execution of any power granted in this Agreement
or for the enforcement of any other legal, equitable or other remedy, as the
Trustee, being advised by counsel, and subject to the foregoing, shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any of the rights of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders.

            Section 8.14 Waiver of Bond Requirement.

            The Trustee shall be relieved of, and each Certificateholder hereby
waives, any requirement of any jurisdiction in which the Trust, or any part

appraisal of the Trust with any court, agency or body at any time or in any
manner whatsoever.

            Section 8.16 Appointment of Custodian.

            Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., has been appointed Custodian by the Trustee
pursuant to the Custodial Agreement. If such entity resigns or is terminated as
Custodian pursuant to the Custodial Agreement, the Trustee shall serve as
Custodian or the Trustee may, with the consent of the Depositor and the
Servicer, appoint one or more Custodians to hold all or a portion of the
Mortgage Files as agent for the Trustee, by entering into a custodial agreement
in the form of the Custodial Agreement or otherwise in a form acceptable to the
Depositor and the Servicer. Subject to this Article VIII, the Trustee agrees to
comply with the terms of the Custodial Agreement and any such custodial
agreement and to enforce the terms and provisions thereof against the Custodian
for the benefit of the Certificateholders. Each Custodian will be a depositary
institution subject to supervision by federal or state authority, shall have a
combined capital and surplus of at least $10,000,000 and shall be qualified to
do business in the jurisdiction in which it holds any Mortgage File and afforded
the same protections hereunder as the Trustee.

                     REMIC AND GRANTOR TRUST ADMINISTRATION

            Section 9.01 REMIC Administration.

            (a) The Trustee shall make or cause to be made REMIC elections for
each of REMIC 1 and REMIC 2 as set forth in the Preliminary Statement on Forms
1066 as prepared by the Securities Administrator or other appropriate federal
tax or information return for the taxable year ending on the last day of the
calendar year in which the Certificates are issued. The Securities Administrator
shall prepare such Forms 1066 and any other appropriate federal tax or
information return and deliver them to the Trustee on a timely basis for the
Trustee's execution. The Trustee shall execute and the Securities Administrator
shall file such forms. The regular interests and residual interest in each REMIC
shall be as designated in the Preliminary Statement.

            (b) The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day" of
each REMIC within the meaning of section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.

            (c) The Securities Administrator shall pay any and all tax related
expenses (not including taxes) of each REMIC, including but not limited to any
professional fees or expenses related to audits or any administrative or
judicial proceedings with respect to such REMIC that involve the Internal
Revenue Service or state tax authorities, but only to the extent that (i) such
expenses are ordinary or routine expenses, including expenses of a routine audit
but not expenses of litigation (except as described in (ii)); or (ii) such
expenses or liabilities (including taxes and penalties) are attributable to the
negligence or willful misconduct of the Securities Administrator in fulfilling
its duties hereunder. The Securities Administrator shall be entitled to
reimbursement of expenses to the extent provided in clause (i) above from the
Trust.

            (d) The Securities Administrator shall prepare or cause to be
prepared, and cause the Trustee to sign and the Securities Administrator shall
file or cause to be filed, each REMIC's federal and state tax and information
returns as such REMIC's direct representative. The expenses of preparing and
filing such returns shall be borne by the Securities Administrator. The
Securities Administrator will apply for an Employer Identification Number from
the Internal Revenue Service via a form SS-4 or any other acceptable method for
all REMICs and other tax entities and will also file a Form 8811 with respect to
all such REMICs with the Internal Revenue Service.

            (e) The Holder of the Class R Certificate shall be the "tax matters
person" as defined in the REMIC Provisions (the "Tax Matters Person") with
respect to each REMIC, and the Securities Administrator is irrevocably
designated as and shall act as attorney-in-fact and agent for such Tax Matters
Person for each REMIC. The Securities Administrator, as agent for the Tax
Matters Person, shall perform, on behalf of each REMIC, all reporting and other
tax compliance duties that are the responsibility of such REMIC under the Code,
the REMIC Provisions, or other compliance guidance issued by the Internal
Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority. Among its other duties,
if required by the Code, the REMIC Provisions, or other such guidance, the
Securities Administrator, as agent for the Tax Matters Person, shall provide (i)
to the Treasury or other governmental authority such information as is necessary
for the application of any tax relating to the transfer of the Class R
Certificate to any disqualified person or organization and (ii) to the
Certificateholders such information or reports as are required by the Code or
REMIC Provisions.

            (f) The Trustee, the Securities Administrator, the Servicer, and the
Holders of Certificates shall take any action or cause any REMIC formed under
this Agreement to take any action necessary to create or maintain the status of
such REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions and shall assist each other as
necessary to create or maintain such status. None of the Trustee, the Servicer,
the Securities Administrator or the Holder of the Class R Certificate shall take
any action or cause any REMIC formed under this Agreement to take any action or
fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC
Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the
status of such REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon
such REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on prohibited transactions as
defined in Code Section 860F(a)(2) and the tax on prohibited contributions set
forth on Section 860G(d) of the Code) (either such event, an "Adverse REMIC
Event") unless the Securities Administrator, the Trustee and the Servicer have
received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such
action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such status
or result in the imposition of such a tax. In addition, prior to taking any
action with respect to any REMIC formed under this Agreement or the assets
therein, or causing such REMIC to take any action, which is not expressly
permitted under the terms of this Agreement, any Holder of the Class R
Certificate will consult with the Securities Administrator, the Trustee and the
Servicer, or their respective designees, in writing, with respect to whether
such action could cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect to such
REMIC, and no such Person shall take any such action or cause such REMIC to take
any such action as to which the Securities Administrator, the Trustee or the
Servicer has advised it in writing that an Adverse REMIC Event could occur.

            (g) The Holder of the Class R Certificate shall pay when due any and
all taxes imposed on any REMIC formed under this Agreement by federal or state
governmental authorities, but only from amounts, if any, distributable thereon.
To the extent that such REMIC taxes are not paid by the Class R
Certificateholder, the Securities Administrator shall pay any remaining REMIC
taxes out of future amounts otherwise distributable to the Holder of the Class R
Certificate or, if no such amounts are available, out of other amounts held in
the Distribution Account, and shall reduce amounts otherwise payable to Holders
of the REMIC Regular Interests or the Certificates, as the case may be.

            (h) The Securities Administrator, shall, for federal income tax
purposes, maintain or cause to be maintained books and records with respect to
each REMIC formed under this Agreement on a calendar year and on an accrual
basis.

            (i) No additional contributions of assets shall be made to any
REMIC, except as expressly provided in this Agreement with respect to Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans.

            (j) None of the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the
Servicer shall enter into any arrangement by which any REMIC will receive a fee
or other compensation for services.

            (k) On or before April 15 of each calendar year, beginning in 2005,
the Securities Administrator shall deliver to each Rating Agency an Officer's
Certificate stating the Securities Administrator's compliance with the
provisions of this Section 9.01.

            (l) The Securities Administrator shall treat (i) the rights of the
Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates) to
receive Cap Carryover Amounts as a right in interest rate cap contracts written
by the Class CE Certificateholders in favor of the Holders of the Certificates
(other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates) and (ii) the rights
of the Class CE Certificates under the Yield Maintenance Agreements in
accordance with the terms thereof and shall assign such rights for federal tax
return and information reporting a value of zero. The Securities Administrator
shall account for such as property held separate and apart from the regular
interests it holds in each of the REMICs created hereunder. The provisions of
this paragraph are intended to satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.860G-2(i) for the treatment of property rights coupled with regular
interests to be separately respected and shall be interpreted consistent with
such regulation. On each Distribution Date, to the extent the Certificates
(other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates) receive interest in
excess of their Pass-Through Rate, such interest will be treated as distributed
to the Class CE Certificates, together with any amount deposited in the Reserve
Accounts in respect of the Yield Maintenance Agreements, and then paid to the
respective Classes of Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R
Certificates) pursuant to the related interest rate cap agreement.

            Section 9.02 Prohibited Transactions and Activities.

            None of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator or
the Trustee shall sell, dispose of, or substitute for any of the Mortgage Loans,
except in a disposition pursuant to (i) the foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan, (ii)
the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund, (iii) the termination of any REMIC pursuant to
Article X of this Agreement, (iv) a substitution pursuant to Article II of this
Agreement, (v) a repurchase of Mortgage Loans pursuant to Article II of this
Agreement or (vi) an optional purchase by the NIMS Insurer and the Depositor
pursuant to Section 3.16 of this Agreement, nor acquire any assets for any REMIC
constituting part of the Trust Fund, nor sell or dispose of any investments in
the Distribution Account for gain, nor accept any contributions to any REMIC
constituting part of the Trust Fund after the Closing Date, unless it has
received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party causing such sale,
disposition, or substitution) that such disposition, acquisition, substitution,
or acceptance will not (a) affect adversely the status of such REMIC as a REMIC
or of the interests therein other than the Class R Certificate as the regular
interests therein, (b) affect the distribution of interest or principal on the
Certificates, (c) result in the encumbrance of the assets transferred or
assigned to the Trust Fund (except pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement)
or (d) cause such REMIC to be subject to a tax on prohibited transactions or
prohibited contributions pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.

            Section 9.03 Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and Loss
of REMIC Status.

            In the event that any REMIC formed hereunder fails to qualify as a
REMIC, loses its status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a
result of a prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC
Provisions due to the negligent performance by the Servicer, the Trustee or the
Securities Administrator of its duties and obligations set forth herein, such
person shall indemnify the Holder of the Class R Certificate against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from such
negligence; provided, however, that no such person shall be liable for any such
Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Trustee, the Depositor or
the Holder of the Class R Certificate, as applicable, nor for any such Losses
resulting from misinformation provided by the Holder of the Class R Certificate
on which such person has relied. The foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or
restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of the Class R Certificate now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
in no event shall the Servicer have any liability (1) for any action or omission
that is taken in accordance with and in compliance with the express terms of, or
which is expressly permitted by the terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses
other than arising out of a negligent performance by the Servicer, the Trustee
or the Securities Administrator of its duties and obligations set forth herein,
and (3) for any special or consequential damages to Certificateholders (in
addition to payment of principal and interest on the Certificates).

            Section 9.04 REO Property.

            (a) Subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations as
shall at any time be in force, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trust hereunder, shall not
rent, lease, or otherwise earn income on behalf of any REMIC with respect to any
REO Property which might cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as
"foreclosure" property within the meaning of section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or
result in the receipt by any REMIC of any "income from non-permitted assets"
within the meaning of section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or any "net income from
foreclosure property" which is subject to tax under the REMIC Provisions unless
the Servicer has advised the Trustee in writing to the effect that, under the
REMIC Provisions, such action would not adversely affect the status of any REMIC
as a REMIC and any income generated for such REMIC by the REO Property would not
result in the imposition of a tax upon such REMIC.

            (b) The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to sell any REO
Property for its fair market value. In any event, however, the Servicer shall
dispose of any REO Property before the close of the third calendar year
beginning after the year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund unless the
Servicer has received a grant of extension from the Internal Revenue Service to
the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant proposed
legislation and under applicable state law, any REMIC constituting part of the
Trust Fund may hold REO Property for a longer period without adversely affecting
its REMIC status or causing the imposition of a Federal or state tax upon any
REMIC constituting part of the Trust Fund. If the Servicer has received such an
extension, then the Servicer shall continue to attempt to sell the REO Property
for its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Servicer for such
longer period as such extension permits (the "Extended Period"). If the Servicer
has not received such an extension and the Servicer is unable to sell the REO
Property by September 30th of the third year after its acquisition by the Trust
Fund or if the Servicer has received such an extension, and the Servicer is
unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending three months before the
close of the Extended Period, the Servicer shall, before the end of the
applicable period, (i) purchase such REO Property at a price equal to the REO
Property's fair market value as determined in good faith by the Servicer or (ii)
auction the REO Property to the highest bidder (which may be the Servicer) in an
auction reasonably designed to produce a fair price prior to the expiration of
the applicable period.

            Section 9.05 Grantor Trust Administration.

            The parties intend that the portions of the Trust Fund consisting of
the right of the Class P Certificates to receive Prepayment Penalties,
Originator Prepayment Penalty Payment Amounts and Servicer Prepayment Penalty
Payment Amounts, the right of the Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P
and Class R Certificates) to receive Cap Carryover Amounts, the Reserve Accounts
and the right of the Class CE Certificates to receive Yield Maintenance
Agreement Payments subject to the obligation of the Class CE Certificates to pay
Cap Carryover Amounts, shall be treated as a "grantor trust" under the Code, and
the provisions hereof shall be interpreted consistently with this intention. In
furtherance of such intention, the Securities Administrator shall furnish or
cause to be furnished (i) the Holders of the Class P Certificates, (ii) to the
Holders of the Regular Certificates (other than the Class CE Certificates) and
(iii) to the Holders of the Class CE Certificates and shall file or cause to be
filed with the Internal Revenue Service together with Form 1041 or such other
form as may be applicable, their allocable shares of income and expenses with
respect to the property held by the Grantor Trust, at the time or times and in
the manner required by the Code.

                                   TERMINATION

            Section 10.01 Termination.

            (a) The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Servicer,
the Depositor, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate
Registrar created hereby (other than the obligation of the Trustee to make
certain payments to Certificateholders after the final Distribution Date and the
obligation of the Securities Administrator to send certain notices as
hereinafter set forth) shall terminate upon notice to the Trustee upon the
earliest of (i) the Distribution Date on which the Principal Balance of each
Class of Certificates has been reduced to zero, (ii) the final payment or other
liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan in the Trust, and (iii) the optional
purchase by the NIMS Insurer, if there is a NIMS Insurer, or if there is no NIMS
Insurer, the Majority Class CE Certificateholders, or if there is no Majority
Class CE Certificateholders, the Depositor of the Mortgage Loans as described
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the trust created hereby
continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor
of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late ambassador of the United
States to the Court of St. James, living on the date hereof.

            The NIMS Insurer, if there is a NIMS Insurer, or if there is no NIMS
Insurer, the Majority Class CE Certificateholders or Depositor may, at its
option, terminate the Trust Fund and retire the Certificates on the next
succeeding Distribution Date upon which the aggregate current Pool Balance is
less than 10% of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance by purchasing all
of the outstanding (i) Mortgage Loans in the Trust Fund at a price equal to the
sum of the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans and except
to the extent previously advanced by the Servicer, accrued and unpaid interest
thereon at the weighted average of the Mortgage Interest Rates through the end
of the Collection Period preceding the final Distribution Date plus unreimbursed
Servicing Advances, Advances and any unpaid Servicing Fees allocable to such
Mortgage Loans and (ii) REO Properties in the Trust Fund at a price equal to
their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Servicer (the
"Termination Price"). If the NIMS Insurer or the Majority Class CE
Certificateholder (or, if there is no Majority Class CE Certificateholder, the
Depositor or an affiliate of the Depositor) is subject to regulation by the OCC,
the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the Office of Thrift Supervision, however, the
option may not be exercised unless the aggregate fair market value of the
Mortgage Loans and REO Properties is greater than or equal to the Termination
Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party may exercise this optional
purchase right unless any Reimbursement Amount owed to the Trust pursuant to
Section 2.03 hereof has been paid.

            Any such purchase shall be accomplished by delivery by the party
exercising the optional purchase right on the Determination Date before such
Distribution Date of the Termination Price to the Securities Administrator for
deposit into the Distribution Account as part of Available Funds.

            (b) Notice of any termination, specifying the Distribution Date
(which shall be a date that would otherwise be a Distribution Date) upon which
the Certificateholders may surrender their Certificates to the Securities
Administrator for payment of the final distribution and cancellation, shall be
given promptly by the Securities Administrator upon the Securities Administrator
receiving notice of such date from the Depositor by letter to the
Certificateholders and the Securities Administrator mailed not earlier than the
15th day of the month preceding the month of such final distribution and not
later than the 15th day of the month of such final distribution specifying (1)
the Distribution Date upon which final distribution of the Certificates will be
made upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office or
agency of the Securities Administrator therein designated, (2) the amount of any
such final distribution and (3) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to
such Distribution Date is not applicable, distributions being made only upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office or agency of the
Securities Administrator therein specified. Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to such Determination Date relating to such Distribution Date, the
Securities Administrator shall notify the Depositor of the amount of any unpaid
Reimbursement Amount owed to the Trust.

            (c) Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the
Securities Administrator shall cause to be distributed to the Holders of the
Certificates on the Distribution Date for such final distribution, in proportion
to the Percentage Interests of their respective Class and to the extent that
funds are available for such purpose, an amount equal to the amount required to
be distributed to such Holders in accordance with the provisions of Sections
4.01 and 4.02 for such Distribution Date.

            (d) In the event that all Certificateholders shall not surrender
their Certificates for final payment and cancellation on or before such final
Distribution Date, the Securities Administrator shall promptly following such
date cause all funds in the Distribution Account not distributed in final
distribution to Certificateholders to be withdrawn therefrom and credited to the
remaining Certificateholders by depositing such funds in a separate escrow
account for the benefit of such Certificateholders, and the Servicer shall give
a second written notice to the remaining Certificateholders, to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect
thereto. If within nine months after the second notice all the Certificates
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Class R Certificateholder
shall be entitled to all unclaimed funds and other assets which remain subject
hereto (except with respect to the Class CE and Class P Certificates) and the
Securities Administrator upon transfer of such funds shall be discharged of any
responsibility for such funds, and all other Certificateholders shall look to
the Class R Certificateholder for payment.

            Section 10.02 Additional Termination Requirements.

            (a) In the event that the NIMS Insurer, the Majority Class CE
Certificateholders or the Depositor exercises its purchase option as provided in
Section 10.01, the Trust shall be terminated in accordance with the following
additional requirements, unless the Securities Administrator shall have been
furnished with an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the failure of the Trust
to comply with the requirements of this Section will not (i) result in the
imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" of the Trust as defined in
Section 860F of the Code or (ii) cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust
Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates (other than
the Class P Certificates) are outstanding:

            (i) The Securities Administrator shall designate a date within 90
      days prior to the final Distribution Date as the date of adoption of plans
      of complete liquidation of each of REMIC 1 and REMIC 2 and shall specify
      such date in the final federal income tax return of each REMIC;

            (ii) After the date of adoption of such plans of complete
      liquidation and at or prior to the final Distribution Date, the Securities
      Administrator shall sell all of the assets of the Trust to the NIMS
      Insurer, the Majority Class CE Certificateholders or Depositor for cash;
      and

            (iii) At the time of the making of the final payment on the
      Certificates, the Securities Administrator shall distribute or credit, or
      cause to be distributed or credited in the order of priority set forth in
      Section 4.02 and then to the Class R Certificateholder, all cash on hand
      in respect of the REMICs after such payment (other than cash retained to
      meet claims) and the Trust shall terminate at such time.

            (b) By their acceptance of Certificates, the Holders thereof hereby
agree to appoint the Securities Administrator as their attorney in fact to: (i)
designate such date of adoption of plans of complete liquidation and (ii) to
take such other action in connection therewith as may be reasonably required to
carry out such plans of complete liquidation all in accordance with the terms
hereof.

            Section 11.01 Amendment.

            This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Depositor,
the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the Trustee; with the consent of
the NIMS Insurer and without the consent of the Certificateholders, (i) to cure
any ambiguity or mistake, (ii) to correct, modify or supplement any provision
herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein or the
Prospectus Supplement, (iii) to make any other provisions with respect to
matters or questions arising under this Agreement, which shall not be
inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, (iv) to comply with any
requirements imposed by the Code or (v) to provide for the rights of the NIMS
Insurer; provided, however, that any such action listed in clause (iii) above
shall not adversely affect in any respect the interests of any
Certificateholder, as evidenced by (i) delivery to the Depositor, the Servicer,
the Securities Administrator and the Trustee of written notification from each
Rating Agency that provides, at the request of the Depositor, a rating for each
outstanding Class of Certificates (other than the Class CE, Class P and Class R
Certificates) to the effect that such amendment will not cause such Rating
Agency to lower or withdrawal of the then current rating of such outstanding
Classes of Certificates with respect to which it is a Rating Agency, or (ii) an
Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and
the Trustee.

            In addition, this Agreement may be amended from time to time by the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the Trustee, with the
consent of the NIMS Insurer and the Majority Certificateholders for the purpose
of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the
Holders of Certificates; provided, however, that no such amendment or waiver
shall (x) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments
on the Certificates which are required to be made on any Certificate without the
consent of the Holder of such Certificate, (y) adversely affect in any material
respect the interests of the Holders of any Class of Certificates in a manner
other than as described in clause (x) above, without the consent of the Holders
of Certificates of such Class aggregating at least 66 2/3% of the Voting
Interests evidenced by such Class, or (z) reduce the percentage of Voting
Interests required by clause (y) above without the consent of the Holders of all
Certificates of such Class then outstanding. Upon approval of an amendment, a
copy of such amendment shall be sent to the Rating Agencies. Prior to the
execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Trustee and the Securities
Administrator will not consent to any amendment of the applicable Agreement
unless it shall first have received an Opinion of Counsel stating that the
execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement. Each
of the Securities Administrator and Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to,
enter into any such amendment which affects the Trustee's or Securities
Administrator's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Securities Administrator, the Trustee or the NIMS Insurer shall
consent to any amendment to this Agreement unless it shall have first received
an Opinion of Counsel, delivered by (and at the expense of) the Person seeking
such Amendment, to the effect that such amendment will not result in the
imposition of a tax on any REMIC constituting part of the Trust Fund pursuant to
the REMIC Provisions or cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust Fund to
fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor
trust at any time that any Certificates are outstanding and that the amendment
is being made in accordance with the terms hereof.

            Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Securities
Administrator shall furnish, at the expense of the Person that requested the
amendment if such Person is the Servicer (but in no event at the expense of the
Trustee), otherwise at the expense of the Trust, a copy of such amendment and
the Opinion of Counsel referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph to the
Servicer and each Rating Agency.

            It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders
under this Section 11.01 to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment; instead it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject to
such reasonable regulations as the Securities Administrator may prescribe.

            Section 11.02 Recordation of Agreement; Counterparts.

            To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement is subject
to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property records in
all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or all of the
properties subject to the Mortgages are situated, and in any other appropriate
public recording office or elsewhere, such recordation to be effected by the
Servicer at the expense of the Trust, but only upon direction of
Certificateholders, accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
recordation materially and beneficially affects the interests of the
Certificateholders.

            For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this Agreement as
herein provided and for other purposes, this Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall together constitute but
one and the same instrument.

            Section 11.03 Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders.

            The death or incapacity of any Certificateholder shall not (i)
operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust, (ii) entitle such
Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the
Trust, or (iii) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties hereto or any of them.

            Except as expressly provided for herein, no Certificateholder shall
have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the operation and
management of the Trust, or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall
anything herein set forth or contained in the terms of the Certificates be
construed so as to constitute the Certificateholders from time to time as
partners or members of an association; nor shall any Certificateholder be under
any liability to any third person by reason of any action taken by the parties
to this Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.

            No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any provision
of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at
law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless such Holder
previously shall have given to the Trustee a written notice of default and of
the continuance thereof, as herein provided, and unless also the Holders of
Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Interests shall have made
written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in
its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such
reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for 60 days after
its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected
or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding. It is understood
and intended, and expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with every
other Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of
Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of any
provision of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the
Holders of any other of such Certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain
priority over or preference to any other such Holder, which priority or
preference is not otherwise provided for herein, or to enforce any right under
this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable
and common benefit of all Certificateholders. For the protection and enforcement
of the provisions of this Section 11.03 each and every Certificateholder and the
Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in
equity.

            Section 11.04 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

            This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such laws. With respect to any
claim arising out of this Agreement, each party irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United
States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New
York, and each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may have at any
time to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating hereto brought in any such courts, irrevocably waives any claim that
any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in any inconvenient forum and further irrevocably waives the right to object,
with respect to such claim, suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party, provided that
service of process has been made by any lawful means.

such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Servicer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action
embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the
"act" of the Certificateholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of

waiver or other action by any Certificateholder shall bind every future Holder

Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Securities

the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Certificate Registrar in writing at least seven Business Days prior to the

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Securities Administrator of the pendency of such
distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the

provided in the Agreement.

designated as Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Asset Backed
Certificates of the Series specified on the face hereof (herein called the
"Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest in the Class AI-1A
Certificates.

            The Class AI-1A Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the Trustee and the
rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of Certificates entitled to the Voting Interests
identified in the agreement. Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate
shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in
exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is
made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also permits the amendment thereof, in
certain limited circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of any of the
Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Securities Administrator as
provided in the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in
the form below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Securities Administrator and required to be paid to
them pursuant to the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or
other liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage
Loan remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated
in the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the
Trust Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such
Mortgage Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party
designated in the Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans
and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined
as provided in the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early
retirement of the Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to
the aggregate Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase
being 10% or less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made

Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Record Date, from funds in the Distribution
Account in an amount equal to the product of the Percentage Interest evidenced
by this Certificate and the amount required to be distributed to the Holders of

            All distributions to the Holder of this Certificate under the
Agreement will be made or caused to be made by or on behalf of the Securities
Administrator by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of
the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Certificate Registrar in writing at least seven Business Days prior to the
Record Date immediately prior to such Distribution Date and is the registered

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Securities Administrator of the pendency of such
distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the

provided in the Agreement.

designated as Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Asset Backed
Certificates of the Series specified on the face hereof (herein called the
"Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest in the Class AI-7
Certificates.

            The Class AI-7 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the Trustee and the
rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities Administrator and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of Certificates entitled to the Voting Interests
identified in the agreement. Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate
shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in
exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is
made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also permits the amendment thereof, in
certain limited circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of any of the
Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Securities Administrator as
provided in the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in
the form below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement. This
Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Certificate
by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, distributions will be made
on the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day immediately following (a "Distribution Date"), commencing on the
first Distribution Date specified above, to the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered on the Record Date, from funds in the Distribution
Account in an amount equal to the product of the Percentage Interest evidenced
by this Certificate and the amount required to be distributed to the Holders of

coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified

or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust

Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the

writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate

less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

provided in the Agreement.

each Distribution Date will be the lesser of (i) the Class M-5 Formula Rate and
(ii) the Pool Cap. Interest will accrue on the Class M-5 Certificates during
each Interest Accrual Period at the Certificate Interest Rate.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Asset Backed
Certificates of the Series specified on the face hereof (herein called the
"Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest in the Class M-5
Certificates.

            The Class M-5 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            This certificate is subordinated in right of payment to the Class A,
Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3 and Class M-4 Certificates as described in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement referred to herein.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders
under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities
Administrator and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Interests identified in the agreement. Any such consent
by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Securities Administrator as
provided in the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in
the form below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in

less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

the Person entitled thereto if such Person shall have so notified the
Certificate Registrar in writing at least seven Business Days prior to the
Record Date immediately prior to such Distribution Date and is the registered
owner of Class M-9 Certificates, or by check mailed by first class mail to the

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Securities Administrator of the pendency of such
distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the
office or agency appointed by the Securities Administrator for that purpose as
provided in the Agreement.

            The Certificate Interest Rate for the Class M-9 Certificates for
each Distribution Date will be the lesser of (i) the Class M-9 Formula Rate and
(ii) the Pool Cap. Interest will accrue on the Class M-9 Certificates during

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Asset Backed
Certificates of the Series specified on the face hereof (herein called the
"Certificates") and representing a Percentage Interest in the Class M-9
Certificates.

            The Class M-9 Certificates are limited in right of payment to
certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            This certificate is subordinated in right of payment to the Class A,
Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6, Class M-7,
Class M-8A and Class M-8B Certificates as described in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement referred to herein.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders
under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities
Administrator and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Interests identified in the agreement. Any such consent
by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Securities Administrator as
provided in the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in
the form below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be
made after due notice by the Securities Administrator of the pendency of such
distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the

provided in the Agreement.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Asset Backed
Certificates of the Series specified on the face hereof (herein called the
"Certificates") and representing the Percentage Interest specified on the face
hereof.

            The Class CE Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain
collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders
under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities
Administrator and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Interests identified in the agreement. Any such consent
by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Securities Administrator as
provided in the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in
the form below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Trustee, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No transfer of this Certificate shall be made unless that transfer
is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and
effective registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws,
or is made in a transaction that does not require such registration or
qualification. In the event that a transfer is to be made without registration
or qualification, the Certificate Registrar shall require, in order to assure
compliance with such laws, either (i) that the Certificateholder desiring to
effect the transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee each
execute a representation letter in the form described by the Agreement
certifying to the Certificate Registrar the facts surrounding the transfer, or
(ii) unless such transfer is made in reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act,
that the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar receive an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to them that such transfer may be made without such registration or
qualification, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the
Depositor, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate
Registrar, in their respective capacities as such. None of the Depositor, the
Certificate Registrar or the Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the
Class of Certificates specified on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any
other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the
Agreement to permit the transfer of such Certificates without registration or
qualification. Any such Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer
shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the Depositor, the
Certificate Registrar and any Servicer against any liability that may result if
the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and
state laws.

            No transfer of a Certificate or any interest therein may be made to
employee benefit plans and certain other retirement plans and arrangements,
including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and
collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans, accounts
or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any materially similar
provisions of applicable federal, state or local law (collectively, "Plans") or
any person who is directly or indirectly purchasing the Certificate or interest
therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a
Plan, unless the proposed transferee provides the Certificate Registrar the
Opinion of Counsel described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Securities Administrator and required to be paid to
them pursuant to the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or
other liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage
Loan remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated
in the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the
Trust Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such
Mortgage Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party
designated in the Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans
and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined
as provided in the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early
retirement of the Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to
the aggregate Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase
being 10% or less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assume no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be

distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the

provided in the Agreement.

            This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates
designated as Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Asset Backed

"Certificates") and representing the Percentage Interest specified on the face

            The Class R Certificate is limited in right of payment to certain
collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

            The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders
under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the Servicer, the Securities
Administrator and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to the Voting Interests identified in the agreement. Any such consent
by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder
and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

            As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in the
Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below
or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Securities
Administrator, the Securities Administrator and the Certificate Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only without
coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests specified
in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

            No transfer of this Certificate shall be made unless that transfer
is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and
effective registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws,
or is made in a transaction that does not require such registration or
qualification. In the event that a transfer is to be made without registration
or qualification, the Certificate Registrar shall require, in order to assure
compliance with such laws, either (i) that the Certificateholder desiring to
effect the transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee each
execute a representation letter in the form described by the Agreement
certifying to the Certificate Registrar the facts surrounding the transfer, or
(ii) unless such transfer is made in reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act,
that the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar receive an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to them that such transfer may be made without such registration or
qualification, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the
Depositor, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate
Registrar, in their respective capacities as such. None of the Depositor, the
Certificate Registrar or the Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the
Class of Certificates specified on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any
other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the
Agreement to permit the transfer of such Certificates without registration or
qualification. Any such Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer
shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the Depositor, the
Certificate Registrar and any Servicer against any liability that may result if
the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and
state laws.

            No transfer of this Certificate or any interest therein may be made
to employee benefit plans and certain other retirement plans and arrangements,
including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and
collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans, accounts
or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any materially similar
provisions of applicable federal, state or local law (collectively, "Plans") or
any person who is directly or indirectly purchasing the Certificate or interest
therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a
Plan.

            The Holder of this Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, shall be
deemed for all purposes to have consented to the provisions of Section 5.02 of
the Agreement and to any amendment of the Agreement deemed necessary by counsel
of the Depositor to ensure that the transfer of this Certificate to any Person
other than a Permitted Transferee or any other Person will not cause the Trust
to cease to qualify as two separate REMICs or cause the imposition of a tax upon
the Trust.

            No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

            The Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities
Administrator and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Trustee, the Securities Administrator or the Certificate Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee,
the Securities Administrator, the Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

            The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund created
thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all amounts
held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to
the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other
liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in
the Agreement at a price determined as provided in the Agreement from the Trust
Fund of all Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage
Loans. The Agreement permits, but does not require, the party designated in the
Agreement to purchase from the Trust Fund all Mortgage Loans and all property
acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in
the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the
Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans at the time of purchase being 10% or
less of the Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance.

            The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of the
Depositor and the Securities Administrator assumes no responsibility for their
correctness.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis by the Buyer, the Buyer used the

            vi. Until the date of purchase of the Rule 144A Securities, the
Buyer will notify each of the parties to which this certification is made of any
changes in the information and conclusions herein. Until such notice is given,
the Buyer's purchase of the Certificates will constitute a reaffirmation of this
certification as of the date of such purchase. In addition, if the Buyer is a
bank or savings and loan is provided above, the Buyer agrees that it will
furnish to such parties updated annual financial statements promptly after they
become available.

COUNTY OF               )

            The undersigned, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as
follows:

            1. The undersigned is [an officer of] , the proposed Transferee of
an Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificates (the "Certificate") issued
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (the "Agreement"), relating to
the above-referenced Certificates, among Wells Fargo Asset Securities
Corporation, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as servicer, Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, as securities administrator, and
[_______________________________], as trustee (the "Trustee"). Capitalized terms
used, but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Agreement. The Transferee has authorized the undersigned to make this
affidavit on behalf of the Transferee.

            2. The Transferee is, as of the date hereof, and will be, as of the
date of the Transfer, a Permitted Transferee. The Transferee is acquiring its
Ownership Interest in the Certificates either (i) for its own account or (ii) as
nominee, trustee or agent for another Person and has attached hereto an
affidavit from such Person in substantially the same form as this affidavit. The
Transferee has no knowledge that any such affidavit is false.

            3. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that (i) a
tax will be imposed on Transfers of the Certificate to Persons that are

if such Transfer is through an agent (which includes a broker, nominee or
middleman) for a Person that is a Disqualified Organization, on the agent; and

the tax if the subsequent Transferee furnished to such Person an affidavit that
such subsequent Transferee is not a Disqualified Organization and, at the time
of Transfer, such Person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is
false.

            4. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that a tax
will be imposed on a "pass-through entity" holding the Certificate if at any
time during the taxable year of the pass-through entity a Person that is a
Disqualified Organization is the record holder of an interest in such entity.
The Transferee understands that such tax will not be imposed for any period with
respect to which the record holder furnishes to the pass-through entity an
affidavit that such record holder is not a Disqualified Organization and the
pass-through entity does not have actual knowledge that such affidavit is false.
(For this purpose, a "pass-through entity" includes a regulated investment
company, a real estate investment trust or common trust fund, a partnership,
trust or estate, and certain cooperatives and, except as may be provided in
Treasury Regulations, persons holding interests in pass-through entities as a
nominee for another Person.)

            5. The Transferee has reviewed the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of
the Agreement and understands the legal consequences of the acquisition of an
Ownership Interest in the Certificate including, without limitation, the
restrictions on subsequent Transfers and the provisions regarding voiding the
Transfer and mandatory sales. The Transferee expressly agrees to be bound by and
to abide by the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the Agreement and the
restrictions noted on the face of the Certificate. The Transferee understands
and agrees that any breach of any of the representations included herein shall
render the Transfer to the Transferee contemplated hereby null and void.

            6. The Transferee agrees to require a Transfer Affidavit from any
Person to whom the Transferee attempts to Transfer its Ownership Interest in the
Certificate, and in connection with any Transfer by a Person for whom the
Transferee is acting as nominee, trustee or agent, and the Transferee will not
Transfer its Ownership Interest or cause any Ownership Interest to be
Transferred to any Person that the Transferee knows is not a Permitted
Transferee. In connection with any such Transfer by the Transferee, the
Transferee agrees to deliver to the Trustee a certificate substantially in the
form set forth in this Exhibit L to the Agreement (a "Transferor Certificate")
to the effect that such Transferee has no actual knowledge that the Person to
which the Transfer is to be made is not a Permitted Transferee.

            7. The Transferee does not have the intention to impede the
assessment or collection of any tax legally required to be paid with respect to
the Certificate.

            8. The Transferee's taxpayer identification number is .

            9. The Transferee is a U.S. Person as defined in Code Section
7701(a)(30).

            10. The Transferee is aware that the Certificate may be a
"noneconomic residual interest" within the meaning of Treasury regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Code and that the transferor of a noneconomic
residual interest will remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the
income on such residual interest, unless no significant purpose of the transfer
was to impede the assessment or collection of tax.

            11. That the Transferee will not cause income from the Class R
Certificate to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed
base, within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty, of the Transferee
or any other U.S. Person.

            12. That, if the Transferee is purchasing the Class R Certificate in
a transfer intended to meet the safe harbor provisions of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.860E-1(c), the Transferee has executed and attached Attachment A
hereto.

            13. The Transferee is not an employee benefit plan that is subject
to ERISA or a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or a plan or
arrangement subject to any materially similar provisions of applicable federal,
state or local law, nor are we acting on behalf of such a plan.
