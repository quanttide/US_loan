ITEM 8.01.  Other Events
            ------------

            On September 29, 2004, Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), sold Home Equity Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-2, Class AI-1A, Class AI-1B, Class AI-2, Class AI-3,
Class AI-4, Class AI-5, Class AI-6, Class AI-7, Class AI-8, Class AI-9, Class
AII-1A, Class AII-1B, Class AIII-1, Class AIII-2, Class AIII-3, Class M-1, Class
M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6 and Class M-7 (the "Offered
Certificates"), having an aggregate original principal balance of
$4,803,904,000. The Offered Certificates were issued pursuant to a Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2004, among the Registrant, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., as Servicer (the "Servicer" or "Wells Fargo Bank"), HSBC Bank
USA, National Association, as trustee, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as securities
administrator (the "Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto.
Home Equity Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2004-2, Class M-8A, Class M-8B,
Class M-9, Class M-10, Class CE, Class P and Class R Certificates, having an
aggregate initial principal balance of $1,238,111,000 the "Private Certificates"
and, together with the Offered Certificates, the "Certificates", were also
issued pursuant to the Agreement.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 97.00% undivided interest in a trust fund (the "Trust
Estate"), consisting principally of a pool of fixed and adjustable interest
rate, conventional, monthly pay, one-to four-family residential first mortgage
loans. The remaining undivided interests in the Trust Estate are evidenced by
the Private Certificates. Distributions on the Private Certificates are
subordinated to distributions on the Offered Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement. Distributions of interest and in reduction of principal balance on
any Distribution Date will be made to the extent that Available Funds are
sufficient therefor.

            An election will be made to treat certain assets of the Trust Estate
as two REMICs for federal income tax purposes.
