                         AMB FINANCIAL CORP. TO TRANSFER
                   STOCK LISTING FROM NASDAQ SMALLCAP TO OTCBB

            Munster, Indiana: AMB Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: AMFC) announced today
that it filed a notice with NASDAQ to terminate the listing of its shares on the
NASDAQ SmallCap Market and that an application has been filed with the-Counter
Electronic Bulletin Board to trade its shares on the OTCBB. According to AMB's
President and Chief Executive Officer, Clement B. Knapp, Jr., "by transferring
our stock listing from the NASDAQ SmallCap Market to the OTCBB, we will be able
to save the Company significant compliance, professional and listing costs. At
the same time, based on our discussions with securities brokerage firms, we do
not feel that this action will result in a material decline in the liquidity of
the market for our stock, although there can be no assurance that this will not
occur."

            AMB Financial Corp. is the holding company of the American Savings,
FSB, a thrift institution which serves its customers through three offices
located in Munster, Dyer, and Hammond, Indiana. At September 30, 2004, the
