<PAGE>

                                THE MORTGAGE POOL

General

      The mortgage pool consists of four groups of mortgage loans, referred to
in the prospectus supplement as "Loan Group 1", "Loan Group 2", "Loan Group 3"
and "Loan Group 4" (and each, a "Loan Group"), and also designated as the "Group
1 Loans", the "Group 2 Loans", the "Group 3 Loans" and the "Group 4 Loans",
respectively. The Group 1 Loans are one- to four-family, adjustable-rate and
fixed-rate, residential mortgage loans secured by first liens on mortgaged
properties that conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan limits. The Group 2
Loans are one- to four-family, adjustable-rate and fixed-rate, residential
mortgage loans secured by first liens on mortgaged properties and one- to
four-family, fixed-rate, residential mortgage loans secured by second liens on
mortgaged properties that may or may not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
loan limits. The Group 3 Loans are one- to four-family, adjustable-rate and
fixed-rate, residential mortgage loans secured by first liens on mortgaged
properties that may or may not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan limits.
The Group 4 Loans are adjustable-rate, multifamily mortgage loans secured by
first liens on mortgaged properties. The mortgage loans will have original terms
to maturity of not greater than 30 years.

      The Group 2 Loans and Group 3 Loans consist of mortgage loans which had
principal balances at origination which may or may not be greater than Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac conforming balances and the Group 1 Loans consist of mortgage
loans which had principal balances at origination which are less than or equal
to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac conforming balances. The conforming balance for
mortgage loans secured by a single family property is $333,700 for all mortgage
loans other than those originated in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the U.S. Virgin
Islands, for which it is $500,550. The conforming balance is higher for mortgage
loans secured by two- to four-family properties. Notwithstanding these
conforming balances, the Group 1 Loans have been originated according to
underwriting standards that do not satisfy Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
underwriting criteria.

      The company conveyed the initial mortgage loans to the trust on the
Closing Date pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Seller made certain
representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans in the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement. The company conveyed the Group 2 subsequent
mortgage loans to the trust during the Funding Period. The Group 2 subsequent
mortgage loans were acquired with amounts on deposit in the Group 2 Pre-Funding
Account pursuant to the Group 2 Subsequent Transfer Instrument. The Seller made
certain representations and warranties with respect to the initial mortgage
loans in the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and with respect to the Group 2
subsequent mortgage loans in the Group 2 subsequent mortgage loan purchase
agreement. These representations and warranties were assigned to the indenture
trustee for the benefit of the Bondholders and the Bond Insurer. As more
particularly described in the prospectus, the Seller has certain repurchase or
substitution obligations in connection with a breach of any such representation
or warranty, as well as in connection with an omission or defect in respect of
certain constituent documents required to be delivered with respect to the
mortgage loans, if such breach, omission or defect cannot be cured and it
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Bondholders or the Bond
Insurer. See "The Mortgage Pools -- Representations by Sellers" in the
prospectus.

      None of the initial mortgage loans were 30 days or more delinquent as of
the Cut-off Date.


                                       1
<PAGE>

      Substantially all of the mortgage loans have scheduled monthly payments
due on the first of the month. Each adjustable-rate Group 1 Loan, Group 2 Loan,
Group 3 Loan and Group 4 Loan is generally assumable in accordance with the
terms of the related mortgage note.

      Each mortgage loan is required to be covered by a standard hazard
insurance policy. See "Primary Mortgage Insurance, Hazard Insurance; Claims
Thereunder - Hazard Insurance Policies" in the prospectus.

Mortgage Rate Adjustment

      The mortgage rate on substantially all of the adjustable-rate mortgage
loans will generally adjust semi-annually or annually commencing after an
initial period after origination of generally six months, two years, three years
or five years, in each case on each applicable adjustment date to a rate equal
to the sum, generally rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percentage point
(12.5 basis points), of (i) the related index and (ii) the gross margin. In
addition, the mortgage rate on each adjustable-rate mortgage loan is subject on
its first adjustment date following its origination to an initial rate cap and
on each adjustment date thereafter to a Subsequent rate cap. All of the
adjustable-rate mortgage loans are also subject to maximum and minimum lifetime
mortgage rates. The adjustable-rate mortgage loans were generally originated
with an initial mortgage rate below the sum of the index at origination and the
gross margin. Due to the application of the initial rate caps, Subsequent rate
caps, maximum mortgage rates and minimum mortgage rates, the mortgage rate on
any adjustable-rate mortgage loan, as adjusted on any related adjustment date,
may not equal the sum of the index and the gross margin.

      The mortgage rate on substantially all of the adjustable-rate mortgage
loans in Loan Group 1, substantially all of the mortgage loans in Loan Group 2,
substantially all of the mortgage loans in Loan Group 3 and substantially all of
the mortgage loans in Loan Group 4 adjusts based on an index equal to Six-Month
LIBOR or One-Year LIBOR. In the event that the related index is no longer
available, an index that is based on comparable information will be selected by
the Master Servicer, to the extent that it is permissible under the terms of the
related mortgage and mortgage note.

      Substantially all of the adjustable-rate mortgage loans will not have
reached their first adjustment date as of the Closing Date. The initial mortgage
rate is generally lower than the rate that would have been produced if the
applicable gross margin had been added to the index in effect at origination.
Mortgage loans that have not reached their first adjustment date are subject to
the initial rate cap on their first adjustment date, and Subsequent rate caps
thereafter.

Indices on the Mortgage Loans

      The index applicable to the determination of the mortgage rate on
approximately 95.73% of the adjustable-rate mortgage loans is the average of the
interbank offered rates for six-month United States dollar deposits in the
London market as published by Fannie Mae or The Wall Street Journal and, in most
cases, as most recently available as of the first business day of the month
preceding such adjustment date, or Six-Month LIBOR.

      The table below sets forth historical average rates of Six-Month LIBOR for
the months indicated as made available from Fannie Mae. The rates are determined
from information that is available as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second
to last business day of each month. Such average rates may fluctuate
significantly from month to month as well as over longer periods and may not
increase or decrease in a constant pattern from period to period. There can be
no


                                       2
<PAGE>

assurance that levels of Six-Month LIBOR published by Fannie Mae, or published
on a different reference date would have been at the same levels as those set
forth below. The following does not purport to be representative of future
levels of Six-Month LIBOR (as published by Fannie Mae). No assurance can be
given as to the level of Six-Month LIBOR on any adjustment date or during the
life of any adjustable-rate mortgage loan based on Six-Month LIBOR.

Prepayment Charges

      Approximately 50.62%, 40.92%, 52.70% and 100.00% of the Group 1 Loans,
Group 2 Loans, Group 3 Loans and Group 4 Loans, respectively (in each case, by
aggregate outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage loans as of the
Cut-off Date), provide for payment by the mortgagor of a prepayment charge in
limited circumstances on prepayments. Generally, mortgage loans with prepayment
charges provide for payment of a prepayment charge on some partial or full
prepayments made within six months, one year, two years, three years, five
years, seven years or ten years or other period as provided in the related
mortgage note from the date of origination of the mortgage loan. No mortgage
loan provides for payment of a prepayment charge on partial or full prepayments
made more than ten years from the date of origination of that mortgage loan. The
amount of the prepayment charge is as provided in the related mortgage note. The
prepayment charge will generally apply if, in any twelve-month period during the
first year, five years or other period as provided in the related mortgage note
from the date of origination of the mortgage loan, the mortgagor prepays an
aggregate amount exceeding 20% of the original principal balance of the mortgage
loan. The amount of the prepayment charge on these loans will generally be equal
to 6 months' advance interest calculated on the basis of the mortgage rate in
effect at the time of the prepayment on the amount prepaid in excess of 20% of
the original principal balance of the mortgage loan. For the multifamily "ARM 3
Year LIB6MO 2/1/1" loans, the amount of the prepayment charge for the first year
is 2% of the principal balance of the related mortgage loan for the first year
after origination, declining by 1% after the first year and remaining until such
charge terminates at the end of the third year. For the multifamily "ARM 3 Year
LIB6MO 3/2/1" loans, the amount of the prepayment charge for the first year is
3% of the


                                       3
<PAGE>

principal balance of the related mortgage loan for the first year after
origination, declining by 1% each year until such charge terminates at the end
of the third year. For the multifamily "ARM 3 Year LIB6MO 4/3/2" loan, the
amount of the prepayment charge for the first year is 4% of the principal
balance of the related mortgage loan for the first year after origination,
declining by 1% each year until such charge terminates at the end of the third
year. For the "ARM 5 Year LIB6MO 3/2/1/1/1" loans, the amount of the prepayment
charge for the first year is 3% of the principal balance of the related mortgage
loan for the first year after origination, declining by 1% after the first and
second year and remaining until such charge terminates at the end of the fifth
year. For the multifamily "ARM 5 Year LIB6MO 5/4/3/2/1" loans, the amount of the
prepayment charge for the first year is 5% of the principal balance of the
related mortgage loan for the first year after origination, declining by 1% each
year until such charge terminates at the end of the fifth year. For the
multifamily "ARM 7 Year LIB6MO 3/3/2/2/1/1/0" loan, the amount of the prepayment
charge for the first year is 3% of the principal balance of the related mortgage
loan for the first and second year after origination, declining by 1% every two
years until such charge terminates at the end of the sixth year. For the
multifamily "ARM 7 Year LIB6MO 5/4/3/2/1/1/1" loans, the amount of the
prepayment charge for the first year is 5% of the principal balance of the
related mortgage loan for the first year after origination, declining by 1% each
year for each of the following four years and remaining until such charge
terminates at the end of the seventh year. For the multifamily "ARM 10 Year
LIB6MO 3/3/3/2/2/2/1/1/1/0" loans, the amount of the prepayment charge for the
first year is 3% of the principal balance of the related mortgage loan for the
first three years after origination, declining by 1% after every three years
until such charge terminates at the end of the tenth year. The prepayment
charges may, in certain circumstances, be waived by the Master Servicer or the
related subservicer. Some of these prepayment charges may not be enforceable in
cases where the mortgagor sells the related mortgaged property. There can be no
assurance that the prepayment charges will have any effect on the prepayment
performance of the mortgage loans. The Master Servicer will deposit all
prepayment charges received on the Group 1 Loans, Group 2 Loans and Group 3
Loans into the Payment Account to be included in the related Available Funds.
The Master Servicer or the related subservicer will be entitled to all
prepayment charges received on the mortgage loans, and these amounts will not be
available for payment on the Securities.

Primary Mortgage Insurance and the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy

      Substantially all of the Group 1 Loans, Group 2 Loans and Group 3 Loans
with a loan-to-value ratio at origination in excess of 80.00% will be insured by
one of the following: (1) a Primary Insurance Policy issued by a private
mortgage insurer (other than a Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy) or (2) the Radian
Lender-Paid PMI Policy.

      Each Primary Insurance Policy will insure against default under each
insured mortgage note as follows: (A) for which the outstanding principal
balance at origination of such mortgage loan is greater than or equal to 80.01%
and up to and including 90.00% of the lesser of the Appraised Value and the sale
price, such mortgage loan is covered by a Primary Insurance Policy in an amount
equal to at least 12.00% of the Allowable Claim and (B) for which the
outstanding principal balance at origination of such mortgage loan exceeded
90.00% of the lesser of the Appraised Value and the sales price, such mortgage
loan is covered by a Primary Insurance Policy in an amount equal to at least
30.00% of the Allowable Claim.

      The Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy will insure against default under each
insured mortgage note as follows: (A) for which the outstanding principal
balance at origination of such mortgage loan is greater than or equal to 80.01%
and up to and including 89.99% of the lesser of the Appraised Value and the
sales price, such mortgage loan is covered in an amount equal to at least 22.00%
of the Allowable Claim, (B) for which the outstanding principal balance at
origination of such mortgage loan is at least 90.00% and up to and including
95.00% of the lesser of the Appraised Value and the sales price, such mortgage
loan is covered in an amount equal to at least 22.00% of the Allowable Claim and
(C) for which the outstanding principal balance at origination of such mortgage
loan is at least 95.01% and up to and including 97.00% of the lesser


                                       4
<PAGE>

of the Appraised Value and the sales price, such mortgage loan is covered in an
amount equal to at least 35.00% of the Allowable Claim.

      With respect to the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy, the premium will be
payable by the Master Servicer out of interest collections on the mortgage loans
at a rate equal to the related Radian PMI Rate. The Radian PMI Rates for the
mortgage loans will range from 0.33% per annum to 3.06% per annum of the Stated
Principal Balance of the related Radian PMI Insured Loan.

      To the extent of a default by Radian under the Radian Lender-Paid PMI
Policy, the Master Servicer will use its best efforts to find a replacement
policy with substantially similar terms, with the approval of the Bond Insurer.
See "Primary Mortgage Insurance, Hazard Insurance; Claims Thereunder - Hazard
Insurance Policies" in the Prospectus.

Mortgage Loan Characteristics

      The Mortgage Pool is comprised of 7,855 mortgage loans, 5,112 of which are
in Loan Group 1, 2,003 of which are in Loan Group 2, 592 of which are in Loan
Group 3, and 148 of which are in Loan Group 4. References to percentages of the
mortgage loans unless otherwise noted are calculated based on the aggregate
principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the Cut-off Date.

      The original mortgages for some of the mortgage loans have been, or in the
future may be, at the sole discretion of the Master Servicer, recorded in the
name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., or MERS, solely as
nominee for the Seller and its successors and assigns, and subsequent
assignments of those mortgages have been, or in the future may be, at the sole
discretion of the Master Servicer, registered electronically through the MERS(R)
System. In some other cases, the original mortgage was recorded in the name of
the originator of the mortgage loan, record ownership was later assigned to
MERS, solely as nominee for the owner of the mortgage loan, and subsequent
assignments of the mortgage were, or in the future may be, at the sole
discretion of the Master Servicer, registered electronically through the MERS(R)
System. For each of these mortgage loans, MERS serves as mortgagee of record on
the mortgage solely as a nominee in an administrative capacity on behalf of the
indenture trustee, and does not have any interest in the mortgage loan. Some of
the Group 1 Loans, Group 2 Loans, Group 3 Loans and Group 4 Loans were recorded
in the name of MERS. For additional information regarding the recording of
mortgages in the name of MERS see "Yield on the Securities-Yield Sensitivity of
the Grantor Trust Certificates" in this prospectus supplement.

Loan Group 1

      The Group 1 Loans had an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off
Date of approximately $1,000,027,380, after application of scheduled payments
due on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received. Approximately 91.73%
of the Group 1 Loans have adjustable rates and are secured by first liens on the
related mortgaged property. Approximately 8.27% of the Group 1 Loans have fixed
rates and are secured by first liens on the related mortgaged property.

      The average principal balance of the Group 1 Loans at origination was
approximately $195,722. No Group 1 Loan had a principal balance at origination
of greater than approximately $608,300 or less than approximately $18,450. The
average principal balance of the Group 1 Loans as of the Cut-off Date was
approximately $195,624. No Group 1 Loan had a principal


                                       5

balance as of the Cut-off Date of greater than approximately $608,300 or less
than approximately $18,407.

      As of the Cut-off Date, the Group 1 Loans had mortgage rates ranging from
approximately 2.750% per annum to approximately 11.750% per annum and the
weighted average mortgage rate was approximately 5.952% per annum. The weighted
average remaining term to stated maturity of the Group 1 Loans was approximately
357 months as of the Cut-off Date. None of the Group 1 Loans will have a first
Due Date prior to May 1, 2001, or after January 1, 2005, or will have a
remaining term to maturity of less than 120 months or greater than 360 months as
of the Cut-off Date. The latest maturity date of any Group 1 Loan is December 1,
2034.

      Approximately 2.55%, 1.29%, 55.77% and 5.09% of the Group 1 Loans have
initial interest only periods of two, three, five and ten years, respectively.

      The loan-to-value ratio of a mortgage loan secured by a first lien is
equal to the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the principal amount of the
loan at origination, to the lesser of the appraised value of the related
mortgaged property at the time of origination and the sales price. The weighted
average of the loan-to-value ratios and combined loan-to-value ratios, as
applicable, at origination of the Group 1 Loans was approximately 76.93%. No
loan-to-value ratio at origination of any Group 1 Loan was greater than
approximately 100.00% or less than approximately 9.98%.

      Approximately 0.01% of the Group 1 Loans are balloon loans. The amount of
the balloon payment on each of these mortgage loans is substantially in excess
of the amount of the scheduled monthly payment on such mortgage loan for the
period prior to the Due Date of the balloon payment. These mortgage loans have a
weighted average remaining term to maturity of approximately 359 months.

      None of the Group 1 Loans are buydown mortgage loans.

      Approximately 99.36% of the Group 1 Loans will not have reached their
first adjustment date as of the Closing Date.

      Approximately 50.62% of the Group 1 Loans provide for prepayment charges.

      Approximately 3.72% and 8.62% of the Group 1 Loans are covered by a
Primary Insurance Policy and the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy, respectively.
For the Group 1 Loans, the weighted average of the Radian PMI Rates for the
mortgage loans covered by the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy is approximately
1.275% per annum.

      Set forth below is a description of certain additional characteristics of
the Group 1 Loans as of the Cut-off Date, except as otherwise indicated. All
percentages of the Group 1 Loans are approximate percentages by aggregate
principal balance as of the Cut-off Date, except as otherwise indicated. Dollar
amounts and percentages may not add up to totals due to rounding.

(1)   All of these Group 1 Loans were reviewed and placed into risk categories
      based on the credit standards of the Progressive Series Program. Credit
      grades of A+, A, A-, B, C and CX correspond to Progressive Series I+, I
      and II, III and III+, IV, V and VI, respectively.

(2)   These Group 1 Loans were originated under the Seller's Progressive
      Express(TM) Program. The underwriting for these Group 1 Loans is generally
      based on the borrower's "Credit Score" score and therefore these Group 1
      Loans do not correspond to the alphabetical risk categories listed above.
      Each mortgage loan originated pursuant to the Express Priority Refi(TM)
      Program has been placed in either Progressive Express(TM) Program II or
      III.

   See "--Underwriting Standards" below for a description of the Seller's risk

      In general, in the case of a mortgage loan made for "rate and term"
refinance purposes, substantially all of the proceeds are used to pay in full
the principal balance of a previous mortgage loan of the mortgagor with respect
to a mortgaged property and to pay origination and closing costs associated with
such refinancing. Mortgage loans made for "cash-out" refinance purposes may
involve the use of the proceeds to pay in full the principal balance of a
previous mortgage loan and related costs except that a portion of the proceeds
are generally retained by the mortgagor for uses unrelated to the mortgaged
property. The amount of these proceeds retained by the mortgagor may be
substantial.

Loan Group 2

      The Group 2 Loans had an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off
Date of approximately $670,000,501, after application of scheduled payments due
on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received. Approximately 88.70% of
the Group 2 Loans have adjustable rates and are secured by first liens on the
related mortgaged property. Approximately 11.30% of the Group 2 Loans have fixed
rates and are secured by second liens on the related mortgaged property.


                                       22
<PAGE>

      The average principal balance of the Group 2 Loans at origination was
approximately $334,632. No Group 2 Loan had a principal balance at origination
of greater than approximately $1,440,000 or less than approximately $18,000. The
average principal balance of the Group 2 Loans as of the Cut-off Date was
approximately $334,499. No Group 2 Loan had a principal balance as of the
Cut-off Date of greater than approximately $1,440,000 or less than approximately
$17,993.

      As of the Cut-off Date, the Group 2 Loans had mortgage rates ranging from
approximately 3.500% per annum to approximately 13.500% per annum and the
weighted average mortgage rate was approximately 5.856% per annum. The weighted
average remaining term to stated maturity of the Group 2 Loans was approximately
358 months as of the Cut-off Date. None of the Group 2 Loans will have a first
Due Date prior to August 1, 2001, or after January 1, 2005, or will have a
remaining term to maturity of less than 176 months or greater than 360 months as
of the Cut-off Date. The latest maturity date of any Group 2 Loan is December 1,
2034.

      Approximately 1.30%, 1.27%, 61.49%, 0.23% and 13.67% of the Group 2 Loans
have initial interest only periods of two, three, five, seven and ten years,
respectively.

      The loan-to-value ratio of a mortgage loan secured by a first lien is
equal to the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the principal amount of the
loan at origination, to the lesser of the appraised value of the related
mortgaged property at the time of origination and the sales price. The combined
loan-to-value ratio of a mortgage loan secured by a second lien is equal to the
ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the principal amount of the loan at
origination, plus the outstanding principal balance of the related senior lien,
to the appraised value of the related mortgaged property at the time of
origination. The weighted average of the loan-to-value ratios and combined
loan-to-value ratios, as applicable, at origination of the Group 2 Loans was
approximately 75.18%. No loan-to-value ratio or combined loan-to-value ratio, as
applicable, at origination of any Group 2 Loan was greater than approximately
100.00% or less than approximately 10.00 %.

      Approximately 2.73% of the Group 2 Loans are balloon loans. The amount of
the balloon payment on each of these mortgage loans is substantially in excess
of the amount of the scheduled monthly payment on such mortgage loan for the
period prior to the Due Date of the balloon payment. These mortgage loans have a
weighted average remaining term to maturity of approximately 359 months.

      None of the Group 2 Loans are buydown mortgage loans.

      Approximately 95.57% of the Group 2 Loans will not have reached their
first adjustment date as of the Closing Date.

      Approximately 40.92% of the Group 2 Loans provide for prepayment charges.

      Approximately 1.29% and 8.85% of the Group 2 Loans are covered by a
Primary Insurance Policy and the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy, respectively.
For the Group 2 Loans, the weighted average of the Radian PMI Rates for the
mortgage loans covered by the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy is approximately
1.124% per annum.

      Set forth below is a description of certain additional characteristics of
the Group 2 Loans as of the Cut-off Date, except as otherwise indicated. All
percentages of the Group 2 Loans are


                                       23

approximate percentages by aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off Date,
except as otherwise indicated. Dollar amounts and percentages may not add up to
totals due to rounding. All references to loan-to-value ratio or LTV in the
following tables refer to the combined-loan-to-value ratio in the case of
mortgage loans secured by second liens.

(1)   All of these Group 2 Loans were reviewed and placed into risk categories
      based on the credit standards of the Progressive Series Program. Credit
      grades of A+, A, A-, B, C and CX correspond to Progressive Series I+, I
      and II, III and III+, IV, V and VI, respectively.

(2)   These Group 2 Loans were originated under the Seller's Progressive
      Express(TM) Program. The underwriting for these Group 2 Loans is generally
      based on the borrower's "Credit Score" score and therefore these Group 2
      Loans do not correspond to the alphabetical risk categories listed above.
      Each mortgage loan originated pursuant to the Express Priority Refi(TM)
      Program has been placed in either Progressive Express(TM) Program II or
      III.

   See "--Underwriting Standards" below for a description of the Seller's risk
                                  categories.

      In general, in the case of a mortgage loan made for "rate and term"
refinance purposes, substantially all of the proceeds are used to pay in full
the principal balance of a previous mortgage loan of the mortgagor with respect
to a mortgaged property and to pay origination and closing costs associated with
such refinancing. Mortgage loans made for "cash-out" refinance purposes may
involve the use of the proceeds to pay in full the principal balance of a
previous mortgage loan and related costs except that a portion of the proceeds
are generally retained by the mortgagor for uses unrelated to the mortgaged
property. The amount of these proceeds retained by the mortgagor may be
substantial.

Loan Group 3

      The Group 3 Loans had an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off
Date of approximately $250,725,039, after application of scheduled payments due
on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received. Approximately 95.40% of
the Group 3 Loans have adjustable rates and are secured by first liens on the
related mortgaged property. Approximately 4.60% of


                                       39
<PAGE>

the Group 3 Loans have fixed rates and are secured by first liens on the related
mortgaged property.

      The average principal balance of the Group 3 Loans at origination was
approximately $423,646. No Group 3 Loan had a principal balance at origination
of greater than approximately $1,000,000 or less than approximately $23,225. The
average principal balance of the Group 3 Loans as of the Cut-off Date was
approximately $423,522. No Group 3 Loan had a principal balance as of the
Cut-off Date of greater than approximately $1,000,000 or less than approximately
$23,212.

      As of the Cut-off Date, the Group 3 Loans had mortgage rates ranging from
approximately 2.750% per annum to approximately 12.125% per annum and the
weighted average mortgage rate was approximately 5.868% per annum. The weighted
average remaining term to stated maturity of the Group 3 Loans was approximately
357 months as of the Cut-off Date. None of the Group 3 Loans will have a first
Due Date prior to February 1, 2004, or after January 1, 2005, or will have a
remaining term to maturity of less than 179 months or greater than 360 months as
of the Cut-off Date. The latest maturity date of any Group 3 Loan is December 1,
2034.

      Approximately 2.37%, 72.20% and 4.35% of the Group 3 Loans have initial
interest only periods of three, five and ten years, respectively.

      The loan-to-value ratio of a mortgage loan secured by a first lien is
equal to the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the principal amount of the
loan at origination, to the lesser of the appraised value of the related
mortgaged property at the time of origination and the sales price. The weighted
average of the loan-to-value ratios and combined loan-to-value ratios, as
applicable, at origination of the Group 3 Loans was approximately 78.49%. No
loan-to-value ratio at origination of any Group 3 Loan was greater than
approximately 100.00% or less than approximately 15.00%.

      Approximately 0.04% of the Group 2 Loans are balloon loans. The amount of
the balloon payment on each of these mortgage loans is substantially in excess
of the amount of the scheduled monthly payment on such mortgage loan for the
period prior to the Due Date of the balloon payment. These mortgage loans have a
weighted average remaining term to maturity of approximately 358 months.

      None of the Group 3 Loans are buydown mortgage loans.

      Approximately 98.98% of the Group 3 Loans will not have reached their
first adjustment date as of the Closing Date.

      Approximately 52.70% of the Group 3 Loans provide for prepayment charges.

      Approximately 4.02% and 12.92% of the Group 3 Loans are covered by a
Primary Insurance Policy and the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy, respectively.
For the Group 3 Loans, the weighted average of the Radian PMI Rates for the
mortgage loans covered by the Radian Lender-Paid PMI Policy is approximately
1.024% per annum.

      Set forth below is a description of certain additional characteristics of
the Group 3 Loans as of the Cut-off Date, except as otherwise indicated. All
percentages of the Group 3 Loans are approximate percentages by aggregate
principal balance as of the Cut-off Date, except as

(1)   All of these Group 3 Loans were reviewed and placed into risk categories
      based on the credit standards of the Progressive Series Program. Credit
      grades of A+, A, and A- correspond to Progressive Series I+, I and II, and
      III and III+, respectively.

(2)   These Group 3 Loans were originated under the Seller's Progressive
      Express(TM) Program. The underwriting for these Group 3 Loans is generally
      based on the borrower's "Credit Score" score and therefore these Group 3
      Loans do not correspond to the alphabetical risk categories listed above.
      Each mortgage loan originated pursuant to the Express Priority Refi(TM)
      Program has been placed in either Progressive Express(TM) Program II or
      III.

      In general, in the case of a mortgage loan made for "rate and term"
refinance purposes, substantially all of the proceeds are used to pay in full
the principal balance of a previous mortgage loan of the mortgagor with respect
to a mortgaged property and to pay origination and closing costs associated with
such refinancing. Mortgage loans made for "cash-out" refinance purposes may
involve the use of the proceeds to pay in full the principal balance of a
previous mortgage loan and related costs except that a portion of the proceeds
are generally retained by the mortgagor for uses unrelated to the mortgaged
property. The amount of these proceeds retained by the mortgagor may be
substantial.

Loan Group 4

      The Group 4 Loans had an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off
Date of approximately $164,913,484, after application of scheduled payments due
on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received. Approximately 100.00% of
the Group 4 Loans have adjustable rates and are secured by first liens on the
related mortgaged property.

      The average principal balance of the Group 4 Loans at origination was
approximately $1,115,809. No Group 4 Loan had a principal balance at origination
of greater than approximately $3,900,000 or less than approximately $255,000.
The average principal balance of


                                       55
<PAGE>

the Group 4 Loans as of the Cut-off Date was approximately $1,114,280. No Group
4 Loan had a principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of greater than
approximately $3,891,602 or less than approximately $254,237.

      As of the Cut-off Date, the Group 4 Loans had mortgage rates ranging from
approximately 4.000% per annum to approximately 6.625% per annum and the
weighted average mortgage rate was approximately 5.276% per annum. The weighted
average remaining term to stated maturity of the Group 4 Loans was approximately
358 months as of the Cut-off Date. None of the Group 4 Loans will have a first
Due Date prior to September 1, 2004, or after December 1, 2004, or will have a
remaining term to maturity of less than 356 months or greater than 359 months as
of the Cut-off Date. The latest maturity date of any Group 4 Loan is November 1,
2034.

      The loan-to-value ratio of a mortgage loan secured by a first lien is
equal to the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the principal amount of the
loan at origination, to the lesser of the appraised value of the related
mortgaged property at the time of origination and the sales price. The weighted
average of the loan-to-value ratios and combined loan-to-value ratios, as
applicable, at origination of the Group 4 Loans was approximately 66.80%. No
loan-to-value ratio or combined loan-to-value ratio, as applicable, at
origination of any Group 4 Loan was greater than approximately 80.00% or less
than approximately 22.67%.

      None of the Group 4 Loans are buydown mortgage loans.

      None of the Group 4 Loans will be subject to the Home Ownership Act or any
comparable state law.

      Approximately 100.00% of the Group 4 Loans will not have reached their
first adjustment date as of the Closing Date.

      Approximately 100.00% of the Group 4 Loans provide for prepayment charges.

      The Group 4 Loans had debt service coverage ratios as of the Cut-off Date
of at least 1.15x but not more than 2.67x, with a weighted average debt service
coverage ratio of approximately 1.31x. The Group 4 Loans had occupancy rates,
determined as of the most recent date information was available, ranging from
approximately 80% to approximately 100%, with a weighted average occupancy rate
at origination of approximately 97.73%.

      All of the Group 4 Loans accrue interest on an actual number of days in
the prior calendar month and a year consisting of 360 days. As a result, the
portion of the scheduled monthly payment in respect of interest received on the
Group 4 Loans will be greater if the prior calendar month has 31 days, and will
be reduced if the prior calendar month is February. However, all of the Group 4
Loans are treated as if they paid interest on a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months.

      None of the Group 4 Loans are cross-collateralized with other multifamily
loans. None of the Group 4 Loans involve borrowers that are bankruptcy-remote
special purpose entities. As a result, defaults and losses could occur for
reasons unrelated to the financial condition or operation of the related
mortgaged property.

      Set forth below is a description of certain additional characteristics of
the Group 4 Loans as of the Cut-off Date, except as otherwise indicated. All
percentages of the Group 4 Loans are


                                       56

approximate percentages by aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off Date,
except as otherwise indicated. Dollar amounts and percentages may not add up to

(1)   All of these Group 4 Loans were reviewed and placed into risk categories
      based on the credit standards of the Progressive Series Program. Credit
      grades of A and correspond to Progressive Series I and II.

(2)   These Group 4 Loans were originated under the Seller's Progressive
      Express(TM) Program. The underwriting for these Group 4 Loans is generally
      based on the borrower's "Credit Score" score and therefore these Group 4
      Loans do not correspond to the alphabetical risk categories listed above.
      Each mortgage loan originated pursuant to the Express Priority Refi(TM)
      Program has been placed in either Progressive Express(TM) Program II or
      III.

      In general, in the case of a mortgage loan made for "rate and term"
refinance purposes, substantially all of the proceeds are used to pay in full
the principal balance of a previous mortgage loan of the mortgagor with respect
to a mortgaged property and to pay origination and closing costs associated with
such refinancing. Mortgage loans made for "cash-out" refinance purposes may
involve the use of the proceeds to pay in full the principal balance of a
previous mortgage loan and related costs except that a portion of the proceeds
are generally retained by the mortgagor for uses unrelated to the mortgaged
property. The amount of these proceeds retained by the mortgagor may be
substantial.
