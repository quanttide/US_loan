INITIAL RESULTS FROM GSK EUROPEAN PHASE 3 STUDY OF ALVIMOPAN </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>EXTON, PA,
December 23, 2004</B> &#151; Adolor Corporation (Nasdaq: ADLR) reported today initial top-line results from a Phase 3 clinical study (SB-767905/001), Study 001, of alvimopan capsules for the management of postoperative ileus (POI). Study 001 was
conducted in Europe, Australia and New Zealand by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to support a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the European Union. GSK and Adolor are collaborating on the worldwide development and commercialization of alvimopan.

COLOR="#000000"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">) of the study is the time to recovery of GI function, as defined by the later of the following two events: time from surgery until the patient first tolerates
solid foods (an indicator of upper GI recovery) and time from surgery until the patient first passes flatus or has a bowel movement (indicators of lower GI recovery). Primary endpoint results were (Cox proportional hazard model) for the 6 mg group,
hazard ratio = 1.22 (P=0.042); and for the 12 mg group, hazard ratio = 1.13 (P=0.20), each as compared to the placebo group. These results are not statistically significant; due to the multiple dose comparison to a single placebo group, a P-value of
less than 0.025 would be required in the 6 mg dose group to be considered statistically significant. Secondary endpoints included an additional measure of time to recovery of gastrointestinal function (GI</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"

investigational peripherally-restricted mu opioid receptor antagonist designed to block the negative effects of opioids, like morphine, on the gastrointestinal system without interfering with the analgesic effects on the central nervous system. It
is the first of this new class with a New Drug Application (NDA) that has been accepted for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for the NDA for Entereg (TM) is
April 25, 2005. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>About Postoperative Ileus (POI) </B></FONT></P> <P

This condition, known as postoperative ileus, may be exacerbated and prolonged by multiple factors including the use of opioid analgesics for pain relief. POI is characterized by abdominal distension and pain, nausea and vomiting, reduced desire to
eat, and an inability to pass gas or stool. POI is a major contributor to prolonged hospital stays. Consequently, POI represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

100 years ago, which has limited effectiveness and is uncomfortable for patients. Currently, there are no drugs approved for the management of POI. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
