Energy Project</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Fort Lauderdale, FL,
December 17, 2004 &#151; Weida Communications, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: WDAC.OB)
announced today that Guangzhou Weida Communications Technology Co., Ltd., of
which it has control and a majority profit-sharing interest, has entered into
an agreement under which China Telecom will lease Weida satellite links and
equipment for China Petro&#146;s West-East Natural Gas Transportation project. The
contract, which was signed on December 13, 2004, represents the first phase of
the project, which is to be implemented in three steps.&#160; The first step covers the project pipeline,
the second covers refineries and depots and the third covers retail gas
stations.&#160; The number of terminals to be
leased in the first phase will be small, and therefore initial revenues from
this phase for Weida will not be substantial. However, this project when all
phases are completed will potentially deploy in excess of 15,000 terminals
nationally by 2007.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The equipment used in the
project will be leased to China Telecom and remain owned by Weida
Communications.&#160; In exchange, Weida will
receive a monthly leasing fee and a communication service fee for each
terminal.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The West-East Natural Gas
Transportation project is the first contract to result from the Cooperation
Framework between Guangzhou Weida Communications Technology Co., Ltd. and China
Telecom announced on August 31, 2004.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;The West-East Natural Gas
Transportation Project is a significant opportunity for Weida Communications,&#148;
said Mitchell Sepaniak.&#160; &#147;It represents
the official launch of Weida&#146;s Cooperation Framework with China Telecom, and is
also a key component in the economic development and social stability of
Xinjiang Province.&#160; Weida is providing
the satellite communications tools for the construction of the main energy line
connecting western and eastern China.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">China Telecom&#146;s contracts
are all signed on a year-by-year basis.&#160;
However, the West-East Natural Gas Transportation project is designed as
a 20-year project.&#160; Weida believes its
contract with China Telecom should continue for at least five years or
more.&#160; It is also expected that the
number of terminals will increase over the duration of the project.</font></p>
