Bechtel Corporation</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">Houston,
Texas &#151; December 20, 2004 </font></b><font size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#151; Cheniere Energy, Inc.
(AMEX:LNG) announced that its wholly owned limited partnership, Sabine Pass
LNG, L.P. (Sabine), and Bechtel Corporation executed a Lump Sum Turnkey
Agreement for the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of the Sabine
Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving, storage and regasification terminal
to be located in western Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Sabine intends to give
Bechtel Limited Notice to Proceed under the EPC agreement for off-site
engineering and preparatory work to commence later this month. Construction at
the site is expected to begin during the first quarter of 2005, and the
terminal is scheduled to be operational in early 2008.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">On December 22, 2003 Sabine filed an
application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for
authorization to construct and operate the terminal with processing capacity of
2.6 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). On November 12, 2004 the FERC staff
concluded in a Final Environmental Impact Statement that approval of the Sabine
Pass LNG Terminal and Pipeline Project, with appropriate mitigating measures as
recommended, would have limited adverse environmental impact. On December 15,
2004 FERC Commissioners voted to issue an Order under Section 3 of the Natural
Gas Act granting approval for the terminal. The terminal will consist of three
160,000 cubic meter storage tanks and two unloading docks capable of handling
ships of up to 250,000 cubic meters &#151; currently the largest ships planned for
construction. Over 600 construction workers are expected at peak construction
and there will be approximately 75 permanent jobs created when the facility is
in operation.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Lump Sum Turnkey agreement is valued at
$647 million. Cheniere has also budgeted approximately $173 million of owner&#146;s
costs and contingencies, bringing the total capital budget to approximately
$820 million before financing costs, changes in commodity prices and
unanticipated change orders.</font></p>
