of Potential Delisting</font></b></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DENVER,
December 28, 2004 / PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/&#151;Ultimate
Electronics,&nbsp;Inc. (Nasdaq: ULTEE) today announced it has received a
notification from the Listing Qualifications Department at The Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. (Nasdaq) that it is in material noncompliance with Marketplace
Rule 4310(c)(14) for continued listing on Nasdaq.</font></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) requires that a
listed company file with Nasdaq all reports and other documents filed or
required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&#160; The Company was unable to file a fully
compliant Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 31, 2004 with the
Commission, and Nasdaq in violation of Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), by the
extension deadline of December 15, 2004. &#160;As of the opening of business on December 23,
2004, an &#147;E&#148; was appended to the Company&#146;s trading symbol &#147;ULTE&#148; to reflect its
noncompliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).</font></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Company is unable to file a fully
compliant Form 10-Q because the Company&#146;s independent auditors have not
completed their work with respect to the Company&#146;s quarterly financial
statements.&#160; The Company is cooperating
fully to ensure that the review of the Company&#146;s quarterly financial statements
by the Company&#146;s independent auditors is completed as quickly as possible.&#160; After this matter is completed, the Company
will file a compliant Form 10-Q/A with both the Commission and Nasdaq as soon
as possible.</font></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="color:windowtext;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The notification does not by itself result in
immediate delisting of the Company&#146;s securities, although Nasdaq stated in the
notification that unless the Company requests a hearing regarding the
delisting, the Company&#146;s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq at the opening
of business on December 30, 2004.&#160; The
Company submitted a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel on this matter on December 27, 2004 and the request will
stay the delisting of the Company&#146;s securities pending the hearing and a
determination by the Panel.&#160; There can be
no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company&#146;s request for continued
listing.</font></p>
