         WHEREAS, the parties hereto are entering into this Amendment pursuant

         NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and

<PAGE>

         (b) Section 5.03(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is hereby

                  Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for

                  or not a P&I Advance is required to be made on a
                  Mortgage Loan for which the Mortgagor has failed to
                  make one or more Monthly Payments due on such
                  Mortgage Loan on or prior to the Cut-off Date, any
                  Monthly Payment received by the Servicer during the
                  Due Period relating to such Servicer Remittance Date
                  shall be deemed to be the Monthly Payment due during
                  such Due Period and the Servicer shall not be
                  required to make a P&I Advance with respect to such
                  Mortgage Loan. In addition, no portion of such
                  Monthly Payment received on such Mortgage Loan will
                  constitute the receipt of an Arrearage with respect
                  to such Mortgage Loan unless all Monthly Payments
                  required to be made on such Mortgage Loan for all
                  prior Due Periods occurring subsequent to the
                  Cut-off Date have been received by the Servicer.

                   SECTION 3. LIMITED EFFECT. Except as expressly amended and
modified by this Amendment, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Reference to this
Amendment need not be made in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any other
instrument or document executed in connection therewith or herewith, or in any
certificate, letter or communication issued or made pursuant to, or with respect
to, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, any reference in any of such items to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement being sufficient to refer to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement as amended hereby.

                  SECTION 4. GOVERNING LAW. This Amendment shall be construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the obligations, rights
and remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in accordance with
such laws without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.

                  SECTION 5. COUNTERPARTS. This Amendment may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall constitute but one and
the same instrument.

                  SECTION 6. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any one or more of
the covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Amendment for any reason
whatsoever shall be held invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or
terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements,
provisions or terms of this Amendment and shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions of this Amendment.

                  SECTION 7. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this
Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors and assigns of the parties hereto, and all such provisions shall
inure to the benefit of the Certificateholders.
