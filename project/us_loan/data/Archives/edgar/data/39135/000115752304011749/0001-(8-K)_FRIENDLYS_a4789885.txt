year, the Company will be required to repay in full all amounts outstanding
under the revolving credit loans between May 1 and June 15 of each calendar year
and not draw down any amounts under the revolving credit facility for a period
of 15 consecutive days immediately following the date of such repayment. Solely

between June 15 and September 30 and not draw down any amounts under the
facility for a period of 30 consecutive days immediately following the date of
