Stern has been appointed general counsel, succeeding Peter G. Skinner, who is retiring Dec. 31 after 20 years of service with the Company. </P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:26pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Mr. Stern, who will be joining Dow Jones this February, also will be a vice president of the Company and will serve as corporate secretary. The legal department, as well as the security department, will report to Mr. Stern. He will report to Peter R. Kann, chairman and chief executive officer of Dow Jones.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:26pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Until Mr. Stern joins the Company, Rosemary Spano, vice president, law, and deputy general counsel, will head the legal department, reporting to Mr. Kann.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:26pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Mr. Stern, a partner with Fried Frank in New York, Dow Jones&#146; primary outside corporate law firm, has worked on a variety of the Company&#146;s legal issues. Most recently, he was the lead outside lawyer supporting Dow Jones in its agreement to acquire MarketWatch.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:26pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">&#147;Joe brings broad legal expertise and experience on corporate acquisitions and other transactions, as well as issues on corporate governance,&#148; Mr. Kann said. &#147;With this background, Joe will be a strong successor to Peter Skinner, whom we thank for 20 years of dedicated and distinguished service to Dow Jones.&#148; &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:26pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">&nbsp;Mr. Stern holds both a bachelor&#146;s degree, Phi Beta Kappa, and a doctor of laws degree from Yale University.
