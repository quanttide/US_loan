<P style="margin:0pt; line-height:15pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Determination of Final Awards</U>. &nbsp;Within 90 days preceding or following the completion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the percentage (not to exceed 100%), if any, of the Maximum Award (as adjusted pursuant to paragraph 5 hereof) to be awarded finally to Grantee (the number of full shares of Common Stock resulting from the application of such percentage being hereinafter called the &quot;Final Award&quot;). &nbsp;In making such determination, the Committee may take into account (A) the extent to which the Performance Criteria were, in the Committee's sole opinion, achieved, (B) other aspects of the individual performance of the Grantee during the Performance Period, and (C) such other factors as the Committee may deem relevant, including unforeseen events or changes in circumstances since the date of grant.</P>
