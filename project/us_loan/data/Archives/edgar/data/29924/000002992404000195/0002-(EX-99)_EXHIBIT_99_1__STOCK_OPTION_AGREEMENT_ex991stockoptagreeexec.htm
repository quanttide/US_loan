schedule set forth in paragraph 2(b) and, upon vesting, shall be exercisable to the same extent as if Optionee&#146;s employment had not terminated. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:50.4pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">(2) &nbsp;If Optionee's employment by the Company or an Affiliate shall terminate for any reason other than death, permanent disability or retirement as aforesaid, this option may be exercised by Optionee, but only to the extent exercisable on the date of such termination, at any time, or from time to time, through the 90th day (or for such longer period as the Compensation Committee (the &quot;Committee&quot;), appointed pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Plan, in its sole discretion, shall determine) after the date of such termination of employment, but no later than the Expiration Date; provided, however, that in the case of termination for cause, all right to exercise this option shall terminate at the date of such termination of employment. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">(e) &nbsp;<U>Adjustments in Event of Change in Common Stock</U>. &nbsp;In the event of any change in the Common Stock of the Company by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any rights offering to purchase Common Stock at a price substantially below fair market value, or of any similar change affecting the Common Stock, the number and kind of shares subject to this option and the purchase price per share shall be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to Optionee hereunder. &nbsp;Any adjustment so made shall be final and binding upon Optionee.</P>
<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">(f) &nbsp;<U>Optionee Has No Rights as a Stockholder</U>. &nbsp;Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to this option prior to the date of issuance to him or her of a certificate or certificates for such shares.</P>

<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">(h) &nbsp;<U>Compliance with Law and Regulations</U>. &nbsp;This option and the obligation of the Company to sell and deliver shares hereunder, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required. &nbsp;The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Common Stock prior to (i) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed, and (ii) the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.</P>
<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">(i) &nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Option</U>. &nbsp;The Committee may, with the consent of the Optionee, from time to time cancel all or any portion of this option then subject to exercise, and the Company's obligation in respect of such option may be discharged either by (i) payment to the Optionee of an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value at such time of the shares subject to the portion of the option so cancelled over the aggregate purchase price of such shares, (ii) the issuance or transfer to the Optionee of shares of Common Stock of the Company with a fair market value at such time equal to any such excess, or (iii) a combination of cash and shares with a combined value equal to any such excess, all as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.</P>
<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">(j) &nbsp;<U>Designation of Beneficiary</U>. &nbsp;Optionee may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries hereunder (the &quot;Beneficiary&quot;) and may from time to time revoke or change any such designation. &nbsp;Any designation of Beneficiary shall be controlling over any other disposition, testamentary or otherwise; provided, however, that if the Committee shall be in doubt as to the entitlement of any such Beneficiary to any rights hereunder, the Committee may determine to recognize only the legal representative of Optionee, in which case the Company, the Committee and the members thereof shall not be under any further liability to anyone.</P>
<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">3. &nbsp;<U>Investment Representation</U>. &nbsp;The Committee may request that the Optionee (or any transferee, Beneficiary, or legal representative) furnish to the Company, at the time of exercise of all or any part of this option, an agreement (in such form as the Committee may specify) in which Optionee or such other person represents that the shares acquired by him or her upon exercise are being acquired for investment and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof. &nbsp;Upon such request, delivery of such representation prior to the delivery of any shares issued upon the exercise of an option and prior to the expiration of the option period shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Optionee or such other person to purchase any shares.</P>
<P style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-indent:36pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">4. &nbsp;<U>Optionee Bound by Plan</U>. &nbsp;Optionee hereby acknowledges that the Company has made a copy of the Plan available to him or her and Optionee agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof.</P>
