         ICORIA GRANTED 180 DAY MINIMUM BID PRICE EXTENSION BY NASDAQ

    RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Dec. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Icoria,
Inc. (Nasdaq: ICOR), a biotech company using systems biology to discover new
biomarkers to enhance drug and agrichemical discovery and development,
announced today that pursuant to the Rules of the National Association of
Securities Dealers the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market granted it 180 days to
bring its share price above the $1 minimum bid price required for listing on
the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.  This approval occurred subsequent to the transfer
of Icoria's shares to Nasdaq SmallCap Market listing, effective on Friday,
Dec. 17.

    "This June 2005 deadline affords us the opportunity to focus on realizing
the benefits that our technology provides and to build shareholder value,"
said Heinrich Gugger, President and CEO of Icoria.  "We believe the healthcare
industry is beginning to recognize the value of Icoria's focus on applying
systems biology to gain a better understanding of how genes and proteins
function in biological systems.  An immediate application of this approach
would be in the discovery of biomarkers for use in developing safer and more
effective drugs."

    Historically, Icoria's revenues have come from research collaborations
with large life sciences companies and government agencies.  As of September
30, 2004, these contracts have a total potential value of $144 million, with
more than $50 million yet to be realized.  Icoria is working to expand its
presence in healthcare through collaborations or services to the
pharmaceutical industry, particularly in metabolomics, gene expression and
tissue analysis.

    "We are making inroads into the pharmaceutical industry.  In fact, in
recent months, we have begun selling services such as gene expression
profiling and pilot biomarker studies to several of the top pharmaceutical
companies," said Peter Johnson, M.D., Chief Business Officer and Chief Medical
Officer.  "Our goal is to build on these initial contracts, developing them
into longer term service agreements and research collaborations."
