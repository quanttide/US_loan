    FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 21, 2004--NMS
Communications (NASDAQ: NMSS) announced today that William Gerraughty,
senior vice president, Finance, and chief financial officer, will
leave the company mid-March 2005. Until that time, he will remain in
office and will continue to exercise full responsibility. The company
has begun the process of identifying a successor.
    "Bill came to NMS to help with the company's financial turnaround
and, thanks to his considerable contributions, that objective was
accomplished during the past year. During his tenure, the company
returned to profitability, successfully completed a public stock
financing and launched two important new products aimed at wireless
markets." said Bob Schechter, chief executive officer of NMS
Communications.
    The company also today affirmed its previously issued guidance for
the fourth quarter, more specifically, modestly higher overall
revenues versus Q3, gross margins of roughly 60%, and stable operating
expenses.
