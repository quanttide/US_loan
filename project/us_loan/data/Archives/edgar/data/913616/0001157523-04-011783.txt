         National Dentex Corporation Announces Resignation Of Director

     WAYLAND, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2004--National Dentex Corporation
(NASDAQ: NADX), one of the largest owner/operators of dental laboratories in the
United States, today announced that Daniel A. Grady has submitted his
resignation from the Company's Board of Directors effective as of December 31,
2004.
     The Company explained that Mr. Grady felt his resignation was in everyone's
best interest due to the imposition of new independence criteria applicable to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") in its capacity as the Company's independent
auditors. In late 2003, Mr. Grady's son was named a partner in PwC's Hartford,
Connecticut office. Effective January 2005, Mr. Grady's son will be relocating
to PwC's Boston office. As a result of this relocation, PwC advised National
Dentex and Mr. Grady that, owing to various independence criteria applicable to
independent auditors and related corporate governance issues, it would not be
able to continue to serve as the Company's independent auditors if Mr. Grady
continued his service on National Dentex's Board of Directors beyond December
31, 2004. Not wanting to jeopardize the Company's existing relationship with
PwC, Mr. Grady informed the Company that he was submitting his resignation from
the Company's Board of Directors effective December 31, 2004.
     Commenting on today's announcement, David L. Brown, President and CEO,
said: "National Dentex salutes Mr. Grady's service to the Company and regrets
the necessity of this decision. The imposition of a variety of new rules and a
change in some factual circumstances has produced the unfortunate result of us
losing the services of a hard-working and extremely capable director."
