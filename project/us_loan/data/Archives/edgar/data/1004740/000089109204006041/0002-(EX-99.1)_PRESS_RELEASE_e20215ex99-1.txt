Capital Corp of the West announces two earnings adjustments.

Merced, California, December 27, 2004-Capital Corp of the West (NASDAQ:NMS:CCOW)
today  announced  that  fourth  quarter  2004  earnings  will be impacted by two
separate  adjustments  to earnings.  The first  relates to  other-than-temporary
impaired  securities,  the  second  relates  to a  California  state  income tax
receivable  generated by consent dividends  declared by a Real Estate Investment
Trust (REIT) available to California banks for the tax years of 2001 and 2002.

"Both of these items  should have no negative  impact on the future  earnings of
CCOW" stated R. Dale McKinney CFO of CCOW.  "Without these two adjustments,  our
earnings  for the full year 2004 should  fall within the 13% to 15%  improvement
over full year 2003,  consistent  with  guidance  already  provided in our Third
Quarter 2004 press release". "We will provide guidance for the full year 2005 in
our scheduled  January 25th,  2005 earnings  release and anticipate the guidance
will be within the recent annual historical CCOW trend lines".

Tom Hawker, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The performance of Capital Corp
of the West,  particularly  over the past three years, has been, by any measure,
outstanding.  We look forward to continuing to deliver equally strong results to
our  shareholders and to the communities we serve in the years ahead. We believe
taking both of these  adjustments at this time eliminates  uncertainty about the
potential  future  effects of either of these  issues.  Also, it is important to
remember  that, as we go forward,  there is also the potential of  recapturing a
portion of these  adjustments  as the  business  environment  changes  and as we
pursue legal remedies with the State of California."

County Bank (the "Bank"),  the primary subsidiary of CCOW, holds two Freddie Mac
preferred stocks with par values of $3,000,000 and $6,710,000 and one Fannie Mae
preferred  stock with a $5,000,000 par value in its investment  portfolio.  Bank
management has been closely  following the market valuations of these stocks and
recent  financial news on these  agencies,  and has now concluded that all three
are  other-than-temporarily   impaired  under  guidance  provided  by  Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 115. As a result a pre tax earnings adjustment
on the  $3,000,000  and  $6,710,000  Freddie Mac and the  $5,000,000  Fannie Mae
stocks of $690,660,  $1,617,110,  and $1,401,400 respectively has been recorded.
The after tax impact of these three  write-downs  total  $2,151,319  with a $.36
fully diluted  earnings per share impact.  Under Generally  Accepted  Accounting
Principles  (GAAP) the market  devaluations  of these  stocks have  already been
recorded  as a reduction  in  comprehensive  income and there are no  additional
charges to capital.

The second adjustment relates to the Bank REIT consent dividend and the state of
California  voluntary  compliance  initiative  (VCI) program  announced in early
2004.  For the years 2001 and 2002 the Bank  recorded  certain state tax savings
related  to the  consent  dividends  declared  by the REIT.  Under the state VCI
program the bank paid, in early 2004,  taxes and interest  relating to the years
2001 and 2002 and  established a $1,563,000  receivable  along with a offsetting
$334,000 Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 5 reserve, both net of federal tax,
for the  pending  refund  claims that have yet to filed.  Management  intends to
actively  pursue our rights for a state tax refund  relating to this  receivable
under  the  legal  and  statutory  process  available.  However,  at  this  time
Management has elected to write off into current period  earnings the $1,563,000
state tax  receivable  less the $334,000 FAS 5 reserve or an after tax impact of
$1,229,000.  The  writing  off of these  amounts  does not impact  the  ultimate
outcome of the legal and statutory  process,  but is a  conservative  measure in
that the final  outcome of the  process is  uncertain  as to amount of  ultimate
recovery and time frames required.  This adjustment  negatively impacts earnings
by $.21 per share.
