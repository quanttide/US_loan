<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><FONT style="font-size: 10pt"><B>DAYTON, OHIO, December&nbsp;31, 2004 </B>&#150; The Reynolds and Reynolds Company (NYSE: REY) today
announced that it expects to exceed earnings guidance for its first fiscal quarter ending December
31, 2004. The company previously provided guidance in the 24 cents per share to 28 cents per share
range for first quarter earnings. The company now expects earnings to be in the range of 32 cents
per share to 36 cents per share.</FONT>
