ITEM 4.02 NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED
          AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW.

         On December 17, 2004, Genius Products, Inc. (the "Company") concluded
that certain errors were made with respect to the financial statements of the
Company for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004 that should have resulted
in a change in the timing of revenues recorded in the quarter totaling $755,260.
The Company has restated its third quarter financial statements and has filed an
amended Form 10-QSB with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The errors were
uncovered in internal reviews by the Company, and the accounting procedures
involved have since been corrected. Accordingly, the financial statements
contained in the originally filed 10-QSB for the quarter ended September 30,
2004 should no longer be relied upon.

         The revenues at issue derived from sales of DVD products in two
separate transactions involving new distribution channels or distributors. In
the first transaction, the Company determined that several shipments of a
multiple shipment sale actually shipped in the first few days of the fourth
quarter rather than during the third quarter. The total revenues involved of
$280,260 will be included in gross revenues for the fourth quarter ended
December 31, 2004. Payment for these shipments was received in full. In the
second transaction, the Company determined that one order totaling $475,000
involved a guaranteed sale commitment, and therefore the Company should have
reserved the full amount against any possible returns. The Company anticipates
receiving payment for this sale during the first quarter of 2005. When the
payment is received and assurances are received that the product will not be
returned, the sale will be recorded in net revenues.

         As adjusted for the restatement, gross revenues for the third quarter
of 2004 were $5.8 million, rather than $6.1 million as originally reported. Net
revenues were $5.0 million, rather than $5.8 million as originally reported. The
Company's net loss for the third quarter was $0.9 million, or $0.04 per share,
rather than a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share.

         The Audit Committee and the authorized officers of the Company have
discussed with the Company's independent registered public accountants the
matters disclosed in this Form 8-K and in the amended Form 10-QSB.
