              GENIUS PRODUCTS RESTATES 2004 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS;
               REVISES 2004 REVENUE GUIDANCE TO REFLECT NET SALES

         SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 23, 2004 - GENIUS PRODUCTS, INC.
(OTCBB: GNPI), a multi-brand family entertainment company, today corrected
certain errors in its financial statements for the third quarter ended September
30, 2004. The company has restated its third quarter financial statements and
today filed an amended Form 10-QSB with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The restatement involves a change in the timing of revenues recorded in the
third quarter totaling $755,260. These revenues derived from sales of DVD
products in two separate transactions involving new distribution channels or
distributors. The errors were uncovered in internal reviews by the company, and
the accounting procedures involved have since been corrected.

         In the first transaction, the company determined that several shipments
of a multiple shipment sale actually shipped in the first few days of the fourth
quarter rather than during the third quarter. The total revenues involved of
$280,260 will be included in gross revenues for the fourth quarter ending
December 31, 2004. Payment for these shipments was received in full. In the
second transaction, the company determined that one order totaling $475,000
involved a guaranteed sale commitment, and therefore the company should have
reserved the full amount against any possible returns. The company anticipates
receiving payment for this sale during the first quarter of 2005. When the
payment is received and assurances are received that the product will not be
returned, the sale will be recorded in net revenues. The company's internal
audit function determined that mistakes in shipping information provided by
vendors contributed to the errors, and changes in the company's internal
controls have now been implemented to avoid future errors.

         As adjusted for the restatement, gross revenues for the third quarter
of 2004 were $5.8 million, rather than $6.1 million as originally reported. Net
revenues were $5.0 million, rather than $5.8 million as originally reported. The
company's net loss for the third quarter was $0.9 million, or $0.04 per share,
rather than a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share. Condensed
consolidated statements of operations, as restated, for the three- and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2004 and the balance sheet at September
30, 2004 accompany this release.

         "We are clearly disappointed that these errors occurred and, with the
oversight of the company's Audit Committee, we have instituted additional
revenue recognition controls to avoid such errors in the future," said Klaus
Moeller, Genius Products' chairman and chief executive officer. "As we grow our
revenues and enter new distribution channels, we continue to take our financial
reporting responsibilities very seriously. We do not believe these isolated
errors detract from the clear progress Genius Products is making in growing our
exciting business."

         Moeller added that the revenue shift and other factors will have a
moderate effect on the company's previously issued revenue guidance for 2004.
"We are also withdrawing our previously issued gross revenue guidance for 2004
as the company has decided to issue net revenue guidance only. We believe that
our net revenues for 2004 will be approximately $17 million." Moeller continues,
"We look forward to 2005 and continuing the stellar success that we have
achieved in establishing Genius products as an emerging leader in family
entertainment."
