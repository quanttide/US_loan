Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

As of December 17, 2004, the registrant entered into an Amendment No. 4 to the
Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the registrant acquired all of the
outstanding stock in its Easton Mortgage Corporation ("Easton") subsidiary in
January 2003. The original Stock Purchase Agreement provided for payment of
consideration in the form of the registrant's promissory notes in favor of the
sellers, RCH, LLC, Timothy A. Birch, Stone Williams, LLC, Craig R. Bush,
Lawrence Anspach and Diana Mead (collectively "Sellers"). None of the Sellers is
an affiliate of the registrant or a related party except in connection with the
sale of Easton shares to the registrant. The promissory notes have since been
amended and restated, and Amendment No. 4 amends them further. Amendment No. 4
provides that the three outstanding promissory notes with an aggregate original
principal amount of approximately $1,854,500, due the sellers from the
registrant, have been modified and replaced with payment by the registrant to
the note holders in the amount of $700,000 cash and execution of a replacement
note by the registrant in favor of the sellers in the principal amount of
$450,000. The source of the $700,000 cash was primarily a loan from a private
investor bearing interest at the rate of 12.5%, and maturing in six months. The
note in the amount of $450,000 issued to the sellers is secured by the capital
stock of Easton and bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum, with all
principal and interest due and payable on or before January, 2007. This note is
non-recourse to the registrant. The registrant has the option to pre-pay this
note in full on or before August 15, 2005, by paying $350,000 cash to the
holder.
