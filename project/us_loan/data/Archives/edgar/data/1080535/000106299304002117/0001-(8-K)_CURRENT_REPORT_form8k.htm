<P align="justify"> Lincoln Gold Corporation (&#8220;We&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
  has entered into subscription agreements with an aggregate of five investors
  for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 2,300,000 units (each a &#8220;Unit&#8221;)
  at a price of &#36;0.30 per Unit for total proceeds of &#36;690,000. Each Unit
  is comprised of one share of common stock and one share purchase warrant (a
  &#8220;Warrant&#8221;). Each Warrant entitles the investor to purchase one additional
  share of common stock for a two year period at a price of &#36;0.40 per share
  during the period from the date of issue to the date that is one year from the
  date of issue and at a price of &#36;0.50 per share during the period from the
  date that is one year from the date of issue to the date that is two years from
  the date of issue. Details of the sales of the Units are provided in Item 3.02
  of this Current Report on Form 8-K. By execution of the subscription agreements,
  we have agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
  in order to register the resale by the investors of the shares and the shares
  issuable upon exercise of the warrants (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;).
  We have agreed to file the Registration Statement within 120 days from the date
  of completion of the sale of the Units, being April 19, 2005.</P>

    <TD> <div align="justify">On December 20, 2004, we completed a private placement
        with three investors of 2,040,000 units at a price of &#36;0.30 per unit
        for total proceeds of &#36;612,000 pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation
        S of the Act. Each Unit is comprised of one share of common stock and
        one share purchase warrant (a &#8220;Warrant&#8221;). Each Warrant entitles
        the investor to purchase one additional share of common stock for a two
        year period at a price of &#36;0.40 per share during the period from the
        date of issue to the date that is one year from the date of issue and
        at a price of &#36;0.50 per share during the period from the date that
        is one year from the date of issue to the date that is two years from
        the date of issue. We did not pay any commissions or other fees in connection
        with the completion of the offering. We completed the offering of the
        units pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Act on the basis that
        the sale of the units was completed in an &#8220;offshore transaction&#8221;,
        as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S. We did not engage in any directed
        selling efforts, as defined in Regulation S, in the United States in connection
        with the sale of the units. The investors represented to us that the investors
        were not U.S. persons, as defined in Regulation S, and were not acquiring
        the shares for the account or benefit of a U.S. person. The subscription
        agreements executed between us and the investors included statements that
        the securities had not been registered pursuant to the Act and that the
        securities may not be offered or sold in the United States unless the
        securities are registered under the Act or pursuant to an exemption from
        the Act. The investors agreed by execution of the subscription agreement
        for the units: (i) to resell the securities purchased only in accordance
        with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the
        Act or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Act; (ii)
        that we are required to refuse to register any sale of the securities
        purchased unless the transfer is in accordance with the provisions of
        Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the Act or pursuant to an
        exemption from registration under the Act; and (iii) not to engage in
        hedging transactions with regards to the securities purchased unless in
        compliance with the Act. All securities issued were endorsed with a restrictive
        legend confirming that the securities had been issued pursuant to Regulation
        S of the Act and could not be resold without registration under the Act
        or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.
