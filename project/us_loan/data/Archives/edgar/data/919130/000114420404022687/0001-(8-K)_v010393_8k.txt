Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
Item 3.02  Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities

      On December 23, 2004, we completed the merger of Onstream Media
Corporation, a Florida corporation, with and into OSM Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company giving effect to
the acquisition and related financing transactions described in our proxy
statement filed with the SEC on November 12, 2004.

      Each share of Onstream Media's common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of merger, exclusive of shares of
Onstream Media's common stock owned by Visual Data Corporation, was converted
into the right to receive 0.1481 shares of our common stock. Each Onstream Media
option or warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger was converted into the right to receive an option or warrant of
Visual Data Corporation based upon the same exchange ratio, with the exercise
price adjusted by the inverse of the exchange ratio.

      On the effective date of the merger, we issued 2,207,966 shares of our
common stock to acquire the remaining interest in Onstream Media, together with
options and warrants to acquire 463,554 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $3.376 per share in exchange for the Onstream Media options
and warrants outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Onstream
Merger.

      As a result of the merger, the current shareholders of Onstream Media own
approximately 31% of Visual Data following the transaction, and the current
shareholder's ownership interests have been diluted to approximately 69% of the
combined companies.

      As a condition to the closing of the Onstream merger, we completed the
financing transactions of $6.5 million. As a result, we have issued to fifteen
(15) investors an aggregate of 215,000 shares of our Series A-10 Preferred stock
at $10.00 per share together with five (5) year warrants to purchase an
aggregate of up to 1,075,000 shares of Visual Data Corporation's common stock at
$1.50 per share.

      We also issued 8% Convertible Notes to twenty-two (22) investors in the
aggregate amount of $4,350,000 due in 2008 (with additional investment rights to
purchase an aggregate of up to $2,175,000 in principal amount of 8% convertible
subordinated notes due in 2008) together with five (5) year warrants to purchase
an aggregate of up to 1,522,500 shares of Visual Data Corporation's common stock
at $1.65 per share.

      In connection with the restructuring of an outstanding note and conversion
of our Class A-8 Convertible Preferred Stock held by Fred Deluca, we issued to
him an aggregate of 239,650 shares of our Class A-10 Convertible Preferred Stock
together with five (5) year warrants to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Visual
Data Corporation's common stock at $1.50 per share.

      All of the financing transaction securities were offered and sold without
such offers and sales being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), in
reliance on exemptions therefrom.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

      On December 23, 2004, we issued a press release announcing the closing of
our $6.5 million financing and the merger with Onstream Media Corporation. A
