Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Principal Officers

      On December 15, 2004 Mr. Robert E. Tomlinson was appointed Visual Data
Corporation's Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Tomlinson joined the company as its
Vice President-Finance in September 2004. Mr. Tomlinson started his financial
and accounting career in 1977 with the international accounting firm of Price
Waterhouse. In 1982 he left that firm to join Embraer, an international aircraft
manufacturing and support firm, at their U.S. subsidiary in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, where he managed all financial functions and eventually was named
Senior Vice President-Finance and a member of the U.S. firm's Board of
Directors. Mr. Tomlinson left Embraer in 1994 and joined staffing and human
resource firm OutSource International, serving as its Chief Financial Officer
and helping to take the company public in 1997. Mr. Tomlinson's areas of
responsibility at OutSource International included corporate accounting,
treasury and risk management. From when he left OutSource International in
February 2000 until 2002 he worked as an independent certified public
accountant, focusing on accounting and tax services to corporations. From 2002
until joining Visual Data, Mr. Tomlinson served as CFO for Total Travel and
Tickets, a Fort Lauderdale based ticket broker. Mr. Tomlinson has held an active
Certified Public Accountant license since 1978.
