ITEM 1.01   ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 23, 2004, we entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to
the LexVision Database and Collaboration Agreement dated as of September 26,
2000 by and between Lexicon Genetics Incorporated and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company (the "LexVision Agreement"). Under the Amendment, the collaboration term
of the LexVision Agreement will end on December 31, 2004 and Lexicon's remaining
obligations under the LexVision Agreement to deliver phenotypic data to
Bristol-Myers Squibb will be limited to phenotypic data with respect to only
those genes specified by Bristol-Myers Squibb in the Amendment, which
obligations Lexicon expects to satisfy by December 31, 2004.

         Concurrently with the execution of the Amendment, Lexicon and
Bristol-Myers Squibb also entered into a Drug Target Validation Collaboration
Agreement dated December 23, 2004 (the "Drug Target Validation Agreement") under
which Lexicon will develop mice and phenotypic data for certain genes previously
requested by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the LexVision Agreement, but that
Lexicon is not required to deliver thereunder, and certain additional genes to
be requested by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

         Lexicon and Bristol-Myers Squibb are also parties to that certain
Collaboration and License Agreement dated as of December 17, 2003 (the
"Neuroscience Drug Discovery Alliance Agreement") relating to the discovery,
development and commercialization of small molecule drugs in the neuroscience
field. The Neuroscience Drug Discovery Alliance Agreement is not affected by the
Amendment or the Drug Target Validation Agreement, and remains in effect in
accordance with its terms.
