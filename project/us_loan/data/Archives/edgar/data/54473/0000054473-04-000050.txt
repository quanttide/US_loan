<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City Life Insurance Company has reached agreement to sell its 50 percent stake in real estate near
the Paradise Village Mall in Phoenix, Arizona for $54 million.  The Company has agreed to sell its interests in two separate transactions.
Most of the property interests are being sold to The Macerich Company,
which controls the other 50 percent interest in the properties.  The sales are expected to close by December 31, 2004 and result in a
pretax realized investment gain of approximately $40 million.</font></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Kansas City Life acquired its interest in the Paradise Village properties more than 20 years ago and has seen the property
develop into one of the most prominent retail properties in the Phoenix market.  The property has been a tremendous investment over
the years, primarily due to excellent local property management and a burgeoning retail market in Phoenix, according to R. Philip
Bixby, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kansas City Life.  "Although the Paradise Village investment has performed better
than we could have anticipated more than 20 years ago, the property is now fully developed and values have never been higher.  We
believe it makes sense for us to pursue reinvestment in other assets," Bixby said.  Real estate accounted for approximately 3 percent
of Kansas City Life's total investments at December 31, 2003, and the Company actively pursues development and acquisition of real
estate.</font></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The sale is expected to contribute  approximately  $26 million to after tax net income during the fourth quarter.  The Company
has earned $25  million  in net  income  through  the first  nine  months of 2004.  Based upon the number of shares  outstanding  as of
September 30, 2004, the sale is expected to add approximately $2.20 per share to net income and book value.
