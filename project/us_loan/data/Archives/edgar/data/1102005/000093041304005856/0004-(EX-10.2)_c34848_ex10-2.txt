                     or call into question the registration, validity, or
                     enforceability of the Package.

              obtained by such party as a result of activities contemplated by
              this Agreement, and each party shall protect the confidentiality
              thereof with the same degree of care that it exercises with
              respect to its own information of a like nature, but in no event
              less than reasonable care. Access to Confidential Information must
              be restricted to the receiving party's employees or agents, who,
              in each case, need to have access to carry out a permitted use and
              are bound in writing to maintain the confidentiality of such
              Confidential Information. The Confidential Information, and all
              copies of part or all thereof, shall be and remain the exclusive
              property of the disclosing party, and the receiving party shall
              acquire only such rights as are expressly set forth under the
              terms and conditions of this Agreement and only for so long as
              such rights are in effect.

              6.2.1  EXCEPTIONS. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein
                     concerning nondisclosure and non-use of the Confidential
                     Information, the obligations shall not apply to any portion
                     of the Confidential Information which the receiving party

                             party making the disclosure pursuant to such an
                             order shall promptly give notice to the other party
                             and make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective
                             order requiring that Confidential Information so
                             disclosed by used only for the purposes for which
