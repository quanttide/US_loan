             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
             -------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Gridline Communications Corp:

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheet of Gridline  Communications Corp
(a  development  stage  company - the  Company) as of September  30,  2004,  and
related statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for the
period from July 2, 2004 (date of inception)  through  September 30, 2004. These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Gridline Communications Corp as
of September 30, 2004,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
period from July 2, 2004 (date of  inception)  through  September  30, 2004,  in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note 3 to the
financial  statements,  the  Company is a  development  stage  corporation  with
limited capital.  Successful development and marketing of the Company's products
and the  procurement  of  additional  financing is necessary  for the Company to
continue  as a going  concern.  The  financial  statements  do not  include  any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                           /s/ R. E. Bassie & Co.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT

                               September 30, 2004


(1)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       ORGANIZATION, OWNERSHIP AND BUSINESS

       Gridline  Communications Corp. (the "Company"),  formerly Halocom,  Inc.,
       was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 2, 2004.
       The Company is a development  stage company formed to provide  integrated
       distribution of broadband  signaling and connectivity  through electrical
       power lines,  to homes,  and offices.  The company plan to provide  Power
       Line  Communication  (PLC),  (which  the  company  may refer to as BPL or
       broadband  over  powerline),  method  of  communications  using  existing
       electric power transmission and electricity  distribution lines. It means
       the company may use  powerline  communications  (PLC) or  broadband  over
       powerline (BPL),  interchangeably.  PLC technology will allow us, through
       the  utilities  companies,  to send or  communicate  more robust data and
       voice over standard 50 or 60 Hz voltage frequency.  The Company, Inc. has
       realized that the dominant  policy trend across the United States and the
       entire  rest  of the  Globe  remains  deregulation,  liberalization,  and
       privatization of the telecommunications sector, and services. This global
       transformation  is  precipitating  a deluge of such  high  volume of data
       Internet traffic, which is exceeding the volume of voice traffic.

       ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

       Accounts  receivable  consist  primarily of trade  receivables,  net of a
       valuation allowance for doubtful accounts.

       INVENTORIES

       Inventories  are  valued at the  lower-of-cost  or market on a  first-in,
       first-out basis.

       INVESTMENT SECURITIES

       The Company  accounts for its investments in accordance with Statement of
       Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  115,   "Accounting  for  Certain
       Investments  in Debt and Equity  Securities."  Management  determines the
       appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at
       the time of purchase and reevaluates  such  determination at each balance
       sheet  date.  Securities  that are  bought and held  principally  for the
       purpose  of  selling  them in the near  term are  classified  as  trading
       securities.  Debt  securities  for  which the  Company  does not have the
       intent  or  ability  to  hold  to  maturity  and  equity  securities  not
       classified as trading  securities are  classified as  available-for-sale.
       The cost of investments sold is determined on the specific identification
       or the first-in,  first-out  method.  Trading  securities are reported at
       fair value with unrealized gains and losses  recognized in earnings,  and
       available-for-sale  securities  are  also  reported  at  fair  value  but
       unrealized  gains and losses are shown in the caption  "unrealized  gains
       (losses) on shares available-for-sale"  included in stockholders' equity.
       Management  determines  fair  value of its  investments  based on  quoted
       market prices at each balance sheet date.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT

                               September 30, 2004


       PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

       Property   and   equipment   are   recorded  at  cost  less   accumulated
       depreciation. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of
       and the related  accumulated  depreciation are removed from the accounts,
       with any resultant gain or loss being  recognized as a component of other
       income or expense.  Depreciation  is computed over the  estimated  useful
       lives of the  assets  (5-20  years)  using the  straight-line  method for
       financial  reporting  purposes  and  accelerated  methods  for income tax
       purposes. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

       ADVERTISING COSTS

       The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred.

       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

       Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

       INCOME TAXES

       The Company is a taxable  entity and  recognizes  deferred tax assets and
       liabilities for the future tax  consequences  attributable to differences
       between the financial  statement  carrying amounts of existing assets and
       liabilities  and their  respective  tax  basis.  Deferred  tax assets and
       liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect
       when the temporary  differences  reverse.  The effect on the deferred tax
       assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
       in the year  that  includes  the  enactment  date of the rate  change.  A
       valuation  allowance is used to reduce  deferred tax assets to the amount
       that is more likely than not to be realized.

       MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

       The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities,
       disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date of the
       financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
       Actual results could differ from these estimates.

       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT

                               September 30, 2004


       of the  Company's  stock at the date of the  grant  over  the  amount  an
       employee must pay to acquire the stock.

       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       The Company  estimates the fair value of its financial  instruments using
       available  market  information and appropriate  valuation  methodologies.
       However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
       develop the estimates of fair value.  Accordingly,  the Company estimates
       of fair value are not  necessarily  indicative  of the  amounts  that the
       Company could realize in a current market exchange.  The use of different
       market  assumption  and/or  estimation  methodologies may have a material
       effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The interest rates payable by
       the Company on its notes payable  approximate  market rates.  The Company
       believes  that the fair  value of its  financial  instruments  comprising
       accounts  receivable,  notes  receivable,  accounts  payable,  and  notes
       payable approximate their carrying amounts.

(2)    CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE

       Convertible notes payable (the Notes) represent 8% convertible notes that
       will mature on September 10, 2005.  The notes bears  interest at the rate
       of 8% per annum and will be payable on the maturity  date.  The notes are
       convertible  into the Company's  common stock in whole or in part, at the
       election  of the  holder  at any  time  prior to the  maturity  date at a
       conversion price of $.10 per share, unless previously  redeemed,  subject
       to certain conditions.  The notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at
       the option of the  Company at any time prior to the  maturity  date for a
       cash  amount  equal to the  redemption  price (105% of  principal  amount
       thereof, together with accrued interest to the redemption date).

       The  Company is  offering  the Note only to  "accredited  investors"  (as
       defined by Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).

(3)    GOING CONCERN

       The Company is a  development  stage  corporation  with limited  capital.
       Successful  development  and marketing of the Company's  products and the
       procurement  of  additional  financing  is  necessary  for the Company to
       continue as a going concern.

       In view of these matters, realization of a major portion of the assets in
       the accompanying  balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of
       the Company.  Management  believes that actions  presently being taken to
       obtain  additional  equity  financing  will  provide the  opportunity  to
       continue as a going concern.
