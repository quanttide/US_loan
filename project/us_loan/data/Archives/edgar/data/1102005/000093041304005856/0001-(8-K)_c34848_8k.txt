                                     GENERAL

         Effective  as of December  13,  2004,  North Shore  Capital IV Inc.,  a
Colorado  corporation  (the  "REGISTRANT"),  entered  into a Share  Exchange and
Reorganization Agreement (the "EXCHANGE AGREEMENT") with Gridline Communications
Corp., a Delaware corporation  ("GRIDLINE"),  and the beneficial holders thereof
(the "GRIDLINE STOCKHOLDERS"),  which sets forth the terms and conditions of the
business combination of the Registrant and Gridline (the "TRANSACTION") in which
all Gridline  Stockholders  exchange every  2.03151261  (the  "EXCHANGE  RATIO")
shares of Gridline  common stock,  par value $.0001 per share,  held by them for
one share of common stock,  par value $0.001 per share (the "NSC COMMON STOCK"),
of  the  Registrant's   successor  in  interest   ("NSC")   resulting  from  the
Registrant's proposed  reincorporation in Delaware.  The Registrant is effecting
such transaction based upon the exemption from registration  afforded by Section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  As a result of the Transaction,
Gridline  shall  become  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Registrant,   and
stockholders of Gridline shall become the  controlling  stockholders of NSC. All
options,  warrants  exercisable for, and securities  convertible into, shares of
Gridline common stock shall, upon the Closing of the Transaction, be exercisable
for such number of shares of NSC Common Stock as the holder  thereof  would have
received if such options and warrants had been  exercised,  or such  convertible
securities  converted,  immediately prior to such Closing. The exercise price of
such  options  and  warrants,  and the  conversion  price  of  such  convertible
securities shall be adjusted by multiplying such price by the Exchange Ratio.

         The Exchange  Agreement  requires the Registrant to change its state of
incorporation  to Delaware  and to increase the number of  authorized  shares to
250,000,000 shares of capital stock to facilitate the Transaction. A copy of the
Exchange  Agreement  is  attached  hereto as  Exhibit  10.1.  The  closing  (the
"Closing") of the Transaction is anticipated to take place during February 2005,
following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the closing conditions set forth
in the  Exchange  Agreement,  including  reincorporation  of the  Registrant  in
Delaware  with an  increased  number of  authorized  shares as required  for the
proposed   Transaction,   approval   by   Registrant's   Stockholders   of  such
reincorporation and proposed  Transaction and completion of all required filings
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

         Pursuant  to the  Exchange  Agreement,  the  holders  of  interests  in
Gridline  shall receive an aggregate of  47,600,000  shares of NSC Common Stock.
Giving effect to such issuances and other  required  issuances to consultants at
the Closing,  the holder of interests in Gridline shall hold approximately 95.5%
of the outstanding NSC Common Stock  immediately  following such issuances.  The
Exchange Agreement provides that, at the Closing,  the existing sole director of
the Registrant shall appoint the directors designated by Gridline (collectively,
the  "DESIGNATED  DIRECTORS")  and the  existing


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


director shall then resign.  Thereafter, the Designated Directors shall comprise
the entire Board of Directors of the Registrant.

         The information set forth herein relating to Gridline has been provided
to the Registrant by Gridline for disclosure herein.


                      PRINCIPAL AND MANAGEMENT STOCKHOLDERS

         The following  table sets forth  information as of the date hereof with
respect to the  beneficial  ownership  of the  outstanding  shares of NSC Common
Stock  immediately  prior to and  following the  Transaction  by (i) each person
known by the  Registrant  to  beneficially  own five percent (5%) or more of the
outstanding  shares;  (ii) the  Registrant's  officers and directors;  (iii) the
Registrant's  officers  and  directors  as a  group;  and  (iv)  the  Designated
Directors  who will  replace  the  Registrant's  current  directors  immediately
following the Closing.

         As used in the table below, the term  "BENEFICIAL  OWNERSHIP" means the
sole or shared  power to vote or direct the voting,  or to dispose or direct the
disposition,  of any  security.  A  person  is  deemed  as of any  date  to have
beneficial  ownership  of any  security  that such person has a right to acquire
within 60 days after such date. Except as otherwise indicated,  the stockholders
listed below have sole voting and  investment  powers with respect to the shares
indicated.  For purposes hereof,  beneficial  ownership prior to the Closing has
been determined  assuming  2,247,500 shares of NSC Common Stock  outstanding and
beneficial  ownership  immediately  following  the Closing  has been  determined
assuming 49,847,500 shares of NSC Common Stock outstanding, giving effect to the
Reincorporation Transaction and the issuance of 2.03151261 shares for each share
of the  Registrant  currently  outstanding,  but  without  giving  effect to the
exercise or conversion of options,  warrants and convertible  securities  which,
upon Closing of the  Transaction,  shall be exercisable for shares of NSC Common
Stock.

consisted of one director, such director was not independent.  Commencing at the
Closing,  the Board of Directors  of the  Registrant  shall  consist of five (5)
directors,  of whom  Herbert  O. Orji,  PhD.,  Vernon L.  Jackson  and Jamila E.
Jefferson are independent.

         Each  director  shall  be  elected  for a  period  of one  year  at the
Registrant's  annual  meeting of  stockholders  and shall  serve  until the next
meeting or until his or her respective  successor is duly elected and qualified.
Each executive  officer of the Registrant  serves at the discretion of the board
of directors and holds office until his or her successor is elected or until his
or her earlier  resignation  or removal in accordance  with our  certificate  of
incorporation and by-laws. The Registrant's  director does not presently receive
any compensation  for his services as director.  The Board of Directors may also
appoint  additional


                                      -7-
<PAGE>


directors up to the maximum number  permitted  under the by-laws.  A director so
chosen  or  appointed  will  hold  office  until  the  next  annual  meeting  of
stockholders.

MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         During the year ended  December  31,  2003,  and during the nine months
ended  September  30, 2004,  the Board of Directors  of the  Registrant  held no
meetings and took no action by written  consent  throughout the respective  time
periods.

         During the period from July 1, 2004 (inception)  through  September 30,
2004,  the Board of Directors  of Gridline  held two meetings and took action by
written consent on three occasions, respectively.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         Following  the Closing,  the  Registrant  intends to establish an audit
committee, a compensation  committee,  and a nominating and corporate governance
committee of the Board of Directors  which shall be  responsible,  respectively,
for the matters described below.

         AUDIT COMMITTEE

         The audit committee shall be responsible for the following:

         o        reviewing  the  results  of  the  audit  engagement  with  the
                  independent auditors;

         o        identifying  irregularities  in the management of our business
                  in  consultation   with  our  independent   accountants,   and
                  suggesting an appropriate course of action;

         o        reviewing  the  adequacy,  scope,  and results of the internal
                  accounting controls and procedures;

         o        reviewing the degree of independence of the auditors,  as well
                  as  the  nature  and  scope  of  our  relationship   with  our
                  independent auditors;

         o        reviewing the auditors' fees; and

         o        recommending  the  engagement of auditors to the full board of
                  directors.

         A charter to be adopted  following  the  Closing  will govern the audit
committee.  Following the Closing,  Herbert Orji and Jamila  Jefferson,  each of
whom will be an  independent  director,  shall be the sole  members of our audit
committee.

         COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

         The  compensation  committee  will determine the salaries and incentive
compensation of the Registrant's  officers and provide  recommendations  for the
salaries and incentive compensation of its other employees and consultants.

         The  compensation  of  the  executive  officers  of the  Registrant  is
generally  determined by the  compensation  committee of its board of directors,
subject to  applicable  employment  agreements.  The  compensation  programs  of
Gridline to date are, and the compensation programs of the Registrant commencing
at the Closing shall be, intended to enable the attraction,  motivation, reward,
and retention


                                      -8-
<PAGE>


of the management  talent required to achieve  corporate  objectives and thereby
increase  shareholder  value.  It has been the  policy of  Gridline  to  provide
incentives  to its senior  management to achieve both  short-term  and long-term
objectives  and to  reward  exceptional  performance  and  contributions  to the
development of its business and the Registrant  anticipates  that the Registrant
shall adopt similar policies following the Closing.  To attain these objectives,
the executive  compensation  program may include a competitive base salary, cash
incentive bonuses, and stock-based compensation.

         In connection with the Transaction,  the Registrant intends to adopt an
incentive equity plan with terms and conditions  substantially  similar to those
of Gridline,  and as a result of the Transaction,  options to purchase shares of
Gridline common stock shall be cancelled and terminated in exchange for the same
number of options  issued under the equity  incentive plan to be adopted by NSC,
as the  successor in interest to the  Registrant.  Under the plan options may be
granted to employees, including executive officers, by the Board of Directors or
the  compensation  committee under the  Registrant's or Gridline's  stock option
plans.  The intent is to provide  an  incentive  that  focuses  the  executive's
attention  on managing  the business  from the  perspective  of an owner with an
equity  stake in the  business.  Options  shall  generally  be  awarded  with an
exercise  price equal to the fair market value of  underlying  securities on the
date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years.

         Gridline has informed the Registrant  that the number of shares subject
to options granted to each  individual  will generally  depend upon the level of
that individual's responsibility. The largest grants will be awarded to the most
senior  officers who, in the view of the  compensation  committee,  have or will
have the greatest potential impact on the future profitability and growth of the
business.  Previous  grants of stock options are reviewed but are not considered
the most  important  factor in  determining  the size of any  executive's  stock
option award in a particular year. The compensation committee will be authorized
to utilize the services of independent consultants from time to time, to perform
analyses  and to make  recommendations  to the  committee  relative to executive
compensation matters. No compensation consultant has so far been retained.

         RELATIONSHIP OF  COMPENSATION TO PERFORMANCE AND  COMPENSATION OF CHIEF
         EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

         Commencing at the Closing,  the  compensation  committee  will annually
establish,  subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the  Registrant
and any applicable employment agreements,  the salaries that will be paid to the
Registrant's executive officers during the coming year. In setting salaries, the
compensation  committee intends to take into account several factors,  including
the following:

         o        competitive compensation data;

         o        the extent to which an individual may participate in the stock
                  plans maintained by the Registrant or Gridline; and

         o        qualitative  factors  bearing on an  individual's  experience,
                  responsibilities, management and leadership abilities, and job
                  performance.

         Following the Closing,  Herbert O. Orji,  PhD. and Jamila E.  Jefferson
will be the members of our compensation committee.

         NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE

         The functions of the nominating and  governance  committee  include the
following:

         o        identifying  and   recommending  to  the  Board  of  Directors
                  individuals  qualified  to serve as the  directors  and on the
                  committees of the Board of Directors;


                                      -9-
<PAGE>


         o        advising  the Board of  Directors  with  respect to matters of
                  board composition, procedures and committees;

         o        developing and recommending to the Board of Directors a set of
                  corporate   governance   principles   applicable   to  us  and
                  overseeing corporate governance matters generally; and

         o        overseeing  the  annual   evaluation  of  the  board  and  our
                  management.

         A  charter  to  be  adopted  following  the  Closing  will  govern  the
nominating  and  governance  committee.   The  members  of  the  nominating  and
governance  committee  are  yet  to be  determined,  each  of  whom  will  be an
independent director.

         Following the Closing,  the nominating  and  governance  committee will
consider  director  candidates  recommended  by  stockholders.   In  considering
candidates  submitted by stockholders,  the nominating and governance  committee
will  take  into  consideration  the  needs  of the  Board of  Directors  of the
Registrant  and  the  qualifications  of  the  candidate.   The  nominating  and
governance  committee may also take into consideration the number of shares held
by the  recommending  stockholder  and the length of time that such  shares have
been held.  To have a candidate  considered  by the  nominating  and  governance
committee,  a  stockholder  must submit the  recommendation  in writing and must
include the following information:

         o        the name of the stockholder;

         o        evidence of the  stockholder's  ownership of our common stock,
                  including the number of shares owned and the length of time of
                  ownership;

         o        the name of the candidate;

         o        the   candidate's   resume  or  a   listing   of  his  or  her
                  qualifications to be one of our directors; and

         o        the candidate's  consent to be named as a director if selected
                  by the nominating  and  governance  committee and nominated by
                  the Board.

         The stockholder  recommendation and information described above must be
sent to the Corporate Secretary at Gridline's executive offices located at 14090
Southwest  Freeway,  Suite 300, Sugar Land,  Texas 77478 and must be received by
the Corporate  Secretary not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of
the Company's  most recent annual meeting of  stockholders,  or, in the event of
the first annual meeting following the Closing, by January 15, 2005.

         The Designated Directors to be members of the nominating and governance
committee  believe  that the  minimum  qualifications  for service as one of our
directors are that a nominee  possess an ability,  as demonstrated by recognized
success in his or her field,  to make meaningful  contributions  to the Board of
Director's  oversight  of  the  business  and  our  affairs  and  an  impeccable
reputation  of integrity and  competence in his or her personal or  professional
activities.  The nominating and governance  committee's  evaluation of potential
candidates  shall be  consistent  with  the  Board of  Director's  criteria  for
selecting new directors.  Such criteria include an understanding of our business
environment  and  the  possession  of such  knowledge,  skills,  expertise,  and
diversity  of  experience  so as to enhance  the  board's  ability to manage and
direct our affairs  and  business,  including  when  applicable,  to enhance the
ability of  committees  of the Board of Directors to fulfill their duties and/or
satisfy any  independence  requirements  imposed by law,  regulation  or listing
requirements.


                                      -10-
<PAGE>


         The nominating and governance  committee may receive  suggestions  from
current board members,  company executive officers, or other sources,  which may
be either  unsolicited  or in  response  to  requests  from the  nominating  and
governance  committee  for  such  candidates.   The  nominating  and  governance
committee  also,  from  time to  time,  may  engage  firms  that  specialize  in
identifying  director  candidates.   As  described  above,  the  nominating  and
governance committee will also consider candidates recommended by stockholders.

         Once the nominating and governance committee has identified a person as
a potential  candidate,  the committee may collect and review publicly available
information  regarding  the  person  to  assess  whether  the  person  should be
considered  further.  If the committee  determines  that the candidate  warrants
further consideration,  the Chairman of the Board of Directors or another member
of the committee may contact the person.  Generally,  if the person  expresses a
willingness  to be  considered  and to serve  on the  Board  of  Directors,  the
nominating and governance  committee may request information from the candidate,
review the person's  accomplishments  and  qualifications and may conduct one or
more  interviews  with  the  candidate.  The  committee  may  consider  all such
information  in light of  information  regarding any other  candidates  that the
committee  might be evaluating  for  membership  on the Board of  Directors.  In
certain instances, committee members may contact one or more references provided
by the candidate or may contact other members of the business community or other
persons  that  may  have  greater   first-hand   knowledge  of  the  candidate's
accomplishments.  The nominating and governance  committee's  evaluation process
does  not  vary  based  on  whether  or  not a  candidate  is  recommended  by a
stockholder,  although,  as stated above, the board may take into  consideration
the number of shares held by the recommending stockholder and the length of time
that such shares have been held.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         The Registrant does not currently have an employment agreement with its
sole director and officer.

         Based upon discussions with Gridline,  the Registrant  anticipates that
it will assume the existing  employment  agreements  with each of the  executive
officers and key employees of Gridline  following the Closing.  These agreements
can be  terminated  at any time,  subject to certain  severance  obligations  as
described  below,  and by the  employee  upon thirty (30) days  advance  written
notice.  The employment  agreements  also include a  confidentiality  clause,  a
non-compete provision,  and provisions restricting the solicitation of employees
or customers.

         Gridline's employment agreement with Blaize Kaduru, its Chief Executive
Officer,  became  effective  June 1,  2004,  and  pursuant  to  this  employment
agreement  Mr. Kaduru will receive a salary of $10,000 per month during the year
ended December 31, 2004, pending the availability of Company funds. Until enough
funds become  available,  Mr. Kaduru will draw a reduced salary in the amount of
$7,500 per month, with the remainder to be deferred.  Beginning January 1, 2005,
the Agreement  provides that the salary of Mr. Kaduru will increase to a monthly
base rate of  $12,500.  Gridline  will review  deferrals  by the end of December
2004,  and pay all amounts in full  deferred by December  2004.  The  employment
agreement with Mr. Kaduru requires that Gridline make severance  payments to the
employee if his employment is terminated by Gridline without "cause". "Cause" is
defined in the employment  agreement.  If termination without cause is effective
after six  months of  employment,  Gridline  is  obligated  to pay six months of
severance at the  employee's  then current salary and premiums for six months of
COBRA continuation  coverage for group medical,  disability,  and life insurance
plans.  If such  termination  is effective on or after two years on the job, the
Company is obligated to pay severance and premiums for twelve months.


                                      -11-
<PAGE>


         Gridline's  employment  agreement with Stanford  Milnes,  its Executive
Vice  President,  Sales and  Marketing,  became  effective  August 1, 2004,  and
provides for a monthly base rate of $8,000.  The  employment  agreement with Mr.
Milnes  requires  that  Gridline  make  severance  payments to Mr. Milnes if his
employment is terminated by Gridline without "cause".  "Cause" is defined in the
employment agreement. If such termination (without cause) is effective after six
months of  employment,  Gridline is  obligated to pay six months of severance at
the  employee's  then  current  salary  and  premiums  for six  months  of COBRA
continuation coverage for group medical, and life insurance plans.

BENEFIT PLANS

         Gridline  intends  to  provide  usual  and  customary  benefits  to its
employees  at  the  appropriate  date  after  the  Closing.   Benefits  will  be
administered  in accordance  with the Gridline's  employee  manual which will be
adopted by the Registrant after Closing.

CURRENT DIRECTOR

         The sole director and executive  officer of the  Registrant at the date
hereof and  immediately  prior to the Closing is Gerard  Werner.  Mr. Werner has
served as the sole director and executive  officer of the  Registrant  since its
inception on February 3, 1999.  Mr. Werner is an attorney and graduated from the
Georgetown  University  Law School in 1997.  Mr. Werner has been a member of the
District of Columbia Bar  Association  since January 1999.  Mr. Werner served as

based in Boca Raton, Florida. He joined the board of Cyberfast in October, 1999,
as a result of Cyberfast's acquisition of Global Telcom and Internet Ventures, a
Colorado  corporation  of  which  he was a  director,  and  served  through  the
company's shareholders meeting in June, 2001, at which time he resigned.

TECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

         Gridline  maintains  a  Technology  Advisory  Committee,   which  meets
periodically  and when  requested  by the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Committee
operates  under   substantially   similar  Technology  Advisory  Board  Services

GRIDLINE COMMUNICATIONS CORP.

         GENERAL

         Gridline is a  development  stage company that was formed as a Delaware
corporation  in July  2004  to  provide  integrated  distribution  of  broadband
telecommunication  and  data  transmission  through  electrical  power  lines to
residences and businesses.  Gridline plans to provide power line  communications
("PLC"),  or broadband over power lines ("BPL"),  using existing  electric power
transmission and distribution lines. PLC technology will allow Gridline, through
utility  companies,  to send  video,  Internet  and  voice  communications  over
standard 50 or 60 Hz voltage  frequencies.  Gridline  believes that the dominant
policy trend  across the United  States and most of the globe  continues  toward
deregulation  and  privatization of the  telecommunications  services sector and
that this  policy  trend will  continue  for the  foreseeable  future.  Gridline
believes  that this global  policy trend is a  supporting  factor in the current
increase in data volume and  Internet  traffic,  which now exceeds the volume of
voice traffic.


                                      -15-

         Gridline's  executive  offices are located at 14090 Southwest  Freeway,
Suite 300, Sugar Land,  Texas 77478 and our telephone number is 281-340-8518 and
fax     is     281-340-8519.      Gridline's     web     site     address     is
www.gridlinecommunications.com and is still under construction.

         STRATEGY

         Gridline's  strategy  is  to  provide  state-of-the-art,  low-cost  PLC
services for traditional utility companies, internet service providers ("ISPS"),
home appliance manufacturers, and equipment vendors worldwide. Gridline believes
these services,  will provide companies the opportunity to create new businesses
and revenue streams utilizing existing infrastructures.  Gridline plans to offer
to  traditional  utility  companies  and  equipment  and  appliances  vendors  a
technology   platform   from  which  they  can   participate   directly  in  the
telecommunications and Internet services industries.  Gridline's system has been
designed and will continue to be developed to be  user-friendly  for these types
of  companies  and  applications.   Gridline  believes  the   telecommunications
companies and cable  operators will also benefit from  Gridline's low cost "last
mile" solution.

         TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

         PLC is a method of sending and  receiving  voice and data signals using
existing electric power transmission and electricity distribution lines. Through
PLC, voice,  data and video signals can be transmitted over electric power lines
by embedding or superimposing a high frequency broadband  communications carrier
signal on wires concurrently  transmitting  electric power at the standard 50 or
60  Hz  alternating   current  frequency.   Communications  are  transmitted  at
frequencies  above  1 MHz  without  affecting  the  quality  of  either  the low
frequency power transmission or the high frequency  communications  signals that
are  using  the  same  circuit.  The  PLC  technology  relies  on  a  series  of
conditioning  filters  to  separate  the  communications  signal  from the power
transmission  frequency.  The  conditioning  filters allow normal electric power
transmission  to  outlets  in homes  and  businesses,  while  data  signals  are
collected by a communications  module or "service unit", which provides multiple
channels for voice, data, video, etc.

         Each home or business  service  unit  communicates  with a base station
server at the local electric  substation,  where the base station connects users
to the Internet by means of fiber or broadband co-axial cable. The configuration
is thus similar to a neighborhood LAN (local area network).  The server operates
through a system of IP  addressing as part of the LAN  environment.  The service
unit is part of the customer premise equipment.  Multiple communications signals
terminate at the customer  premises with PLC. The service unit  distributes  and
simultaneously  manages  various  other types of equipment  such as  telephones,
computers,  and other devices, which co-exist and operate concurrently,  without
interference.

         PLC  has  been  feasible  for  quite  sometime  and  is the  basis  for
monitoring and control of load-balancing,  automation, remote meter reading, and
limited  data  communications  at very  low  data  bit  rates  (9600  bps).  The
proliferation  of the technology into home  networking and broadband  access are
key factors in the  development of the anticipated new generation of "smart home
appliances"  that can be programmed  and  controlled by remote users,  including
televisions,  refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, dryers, stoves,
personal computers, ovens, and microwaves.  Gridline believes that for consumers
to realize many of the potential benefits of home automation,  they must be able
to communicate  directly with these appliances  through the Internet by means of
power lines.  Without PLC, the cost and  inconvenience of installing the network
needed to create a sub-LAN  environment to support smart home  appliances  makes
many of their potential features infeasible.

         There are  challenges and technical  difficulties,  which have made PLC
less user friendly. In the United States for instance,  step-down  transformers,
which reduce  voltage from high voltage  carrier  lines to standard home service
levels,  serve a  smaller  number of homes,  and the  homes are  usually  spread


                                      -16-
<PAGE>


further apart than in many other  countries.  PLC will be less efficient in this
case. There are potential  inherent problems with noise,  signal  degradation or
attenuation, and distortion with PLC. However, more efficient techniques such as
new modulation technology,  more efficient coupling (the superimposition of data
signals  onto the power  voltage),  channel  coding to minimize  error bit rate,
while increasing speed, and meeting ITU standards,  have resulted in significant
improvements as measured in recent tests conducted on PLC technology.

GRIDLINE'S CUSTOMERS

         Gridline's  expected customer base will be electric utility  companies,
competitive local exchange carriers ("CLECS"),  ISPs, and cable modem operators.
Gridline  intends to negotiate  with these  customers for  long-term  contracts.
Under these  long-term  contracts,  Gridline  expects to deliver  equipment  and
technical  support  which will be  delivered  and  installed  for the benefit of
end-users,  to its various  customers.  Gridline expects initial end-users to be
the existing customers of the utility, CLEC, or other Gridline customers.

         Gridline  believes that its products and services will be compelling to
electric  utility  companies,  quickly putting them in the business of providing
broadband  access and realizing new revenue  streams from a business with little
or no rate regulation which requires little capital commitment. Gridline expects
that its utility company customers can market effectively through direct mailing
to their existing customers, and that such customers can collect the new revenue
stream  by  adding a line for  broadband  services  to  their  current  customer
invoices in their ongoing billing and collection efforts. Gridline believes that
the cross-selling  opportunity to existing utility company  customers,  together
with the  convenience  for those customers in enrolling and paying for broadband
services with their existing  electric  service  provider will contribute to the
success of Gridline's PLC system.  Gridline also believes that it can provide an
attractive  alternative for CLECs and ISPs that are now paying their competitors
for delivery of telecommunication services to their respective customers.

         Gridline may negotiate tri-partite contractual agreements with CLECs or
ISPs to provide  broadband  access  services over the utility's  electric  power
grid,  with each party to the  agreement  receiving  a portion  of the  revenue.
Utilities  in this case will access a new revenue  stream,  while ISPs and CLECs
will increase their customer base with the opportunity to provide new services.

SERVICE AREAS; COST TO PROVIDE SERVICE

         Gridline  intends to install  and  maintain  the system  equipment  and
control  software for each area where it provides PLC service  ("SERVICE  AREA")
and throughout the power grid as required to connect  end-users with an Internet
access  point.  Gridline  intends to obtain  contracts  with ISPs for  wholesale
Internet access for all Gridline customers and end-users at such Internet access
points. Because of the cost required to develop a Service Area for PLC, Gridline
anticipates  that its customers will initially roll out PLC service to end users
only in specified  Service Areas.  Gridline will be required to deliver end-user
equipment and train Gridline  customers (e.g., CLECs and ISPs, not end-users) to
install and maintain its PLC system and to instruct  end-users in the use of the
equipment.  Except  for  Gridline's  initial  low  voltage  system  and  initial
mid-voltage system, payment terms related to the manufacture and delivery of the
equipment have not yet been negotiated.

SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH END USERS

         Although  Gridline  anticipates  long term contracts with its customers
(up to 10 years),  it expects  that its  customers  (e.g.,  CLECs,  ISPs,  cable
operators),  as service providers to end users, will require  relatively shorter
commitments  from  their  customers.  Given  the cost to equip and  install  PLC
broadband access services within a Service Area,  Gridline  anticipates that its
customers will require an end-user


                                      -17-
<PAGE>


commitment  that will ensure  recovery of the fixed cost of  initiating  service
(i.e., approximately a two-year service contract at competitive rates).

GRIDLINE'S PRODUCTS

         Gridline  intends to offer  products  and  services  over the  existing
electrical  cable  and  wiring  infrastructure,  for  both  indoor  and  outdoor
applications and for both narrowband and broadband.

         For  narrowband,  Gridline  plans to offer the  following  products and
services:

         o        energy management;

         o        command and control for home appliance manufacturers; and

         o        security monitoring for homes, offices, security agencies.

         For broadband, Gridline plans to offer:

         o        co-branded power line IP enabled home  entertainment  products
                  and services;

         o        co-branded small office/home office (SOHO);

         o        co-branded PLC enabled access and mini-access; and

         o        co-branded  DSL  and  cable  modem   extension   products  and
                  services.

         HOME NETWORKING.  By applying a PLC extension to the DSL or cable modem
that is providing  broadband Internet connection to a home, the file sharing and
connections  to a  printer  in that home  could be  networked  between  personal
computers ("PCS"),  laptop computers,  PDAs, and other computing devices located
in the home without the  installation of additional  cabling.  In this scenario,
Gridline's  integrated  network  products will have converted  every  electrical
outlet in the house into a sub-network node for an integrated network connection
and application.

         SMALL  OFFICE/HOME  OFFICE (SOHO).  The same integrated  shared network
connections and applications  achieved in-home networking discussed above can be
duplicated  in a SOHO  environment  using  existing  wall  power  outlets in the
office. In addition,  VoIP over power line telephone systems can be set up using
existing electrical wall sockets, instead of resorting to costly special regular
hard-wire line phone jack  preparations.  In a normal SOHO  environment,  adding
additional phone jacks can pose both planning and logistical complexities.

         PLC ACCESS AND MINI-ACCESS.  Utility  companies can avail themselves of
the  opportunity  to offer  PLC  access  to their  existing  end-users,  thereby
creating a brand new revenue  stream by  implementing  Gridline's  PLC modems to
deliver  telecommunications  services and a number broadband access applications
such  as  Internet  services,  video-on-demand,  audio,  voice,  security  alarm
monitoring,  and energy management  services over the utility company's existing
medium and low power electrical grids. Most electrical utility companies already
own  their  fiber  optic  infrastructure,  which  have  remained  unutilized  or
underutilized.  This  connectivity  can now be shared by several  apartments  or
office buildings.

         DSL AND CABLE  MODEM  EXTENSIONS.  DSL or digital  subscriber  line and
cable modem  broadband  connectivity  has become very popular with  end-users in
recent  years,  either for home use,


                                      -18-
<PAGE>


office use, or both. As rule,  the PC or laptop  equipment must be located close
to the modem.  Gridline's  PLC  technology can be used by vendors of any type to
extend the distance of this connectivity to other rooms or spaces in the home or
office  without the need for  additional  infrastructure.  The  electrical  wall
outlets can be used to deploy multiple computers (both laptops and desktops) and
extend the DSL or cable modem connectivity.  This way, Internet  connectivity is
not limited to the PC located next to the modem.

         DISTRIBUTED   BROADBAND   CONNECTIVITY.   Gridline's  PLC   distributed
protocols can support audio, video, and data transmissions, using our co-branded
chipsets to be deployed over the media access control layer of most hardware for
code broadcasts, Internet, and other applications.

         AGENT OR LICENSEE  SOLUTION.  Gridline's  planned licensee  solution is
comprised  of:  (i)  broadband  access,  (ii)  services  that  allow  agents and
licensees  to upload an  unlimited  number of  programs  (both photo and video),
(iii) a personal,  customized company website where their company information is
hosted and marketed, (iv) significant exposure and lead generation on Gridline's
industry  portal,  (v)  personalized  online  office and  e-mail,  (vi)  ongoing
priority training, information resources, and enhanced customer support, product
updates, and (vii) a single provider for technology issues and needs.

         PRICING.  Gridline  intends  to focus on  product  margins  in both the
initial sale and monthly  subscription  fees for products and services.  Margins
may change in the future depending on a variety of factors,  including  products
and services offered.

         CUSTOMERS.  Potential  initial target customers of Gridline are utility
companies,   telecommunications   companies,  cable  companies,  home  appliance
manufacturers, ISPs, and commercial and residential property developers, located
in the United States, Latin America,  Asia, the Pacific Region,  Europe, Africa,
and the Middle East.

         CONSUMER WEBSITE.  Gridline's consumer website is under development but
can  be  viewed  in  its  unfinished   form  when   construction   commences  at
www.gridlinecommunications.com.  Gridline  has  designed  its  website  to allow
vendors to  efficiently  find  products and services  information  meeting their
parameters and interests.  Studies confirm that consumers want a personal online
home-viewing   experience,   including   multiple   photos   and   comprehensive
technologies   information.   Real-time  content  combined  with   user-friendly
navigation  will  distinguish the Gridline  website.  Gridline plans to minimize
distractive  ads and  emphasize  ease of use in order to  become  the  preferred
website for consumers' PLC technology needs.

         SERVICES.   Gridline  is  in  the  process  of  developing  proprietary
integrated  distributed  power line  communications  technologies.  Gridline  is
currently developing these technologies through a product development  agreement
with iGate,  a leader in the  provision  of broadband  "last mile"  solutions to
telecommunications  companies  worldwide over existing copper  telephone  wires.
iGate  currently  owns  beneficially  and  of  record  approximately  25% of the
outstanding  capital stock of Gridline,  and will own beneficially and of record
approximately  20.7% of the outstanding NSC Common Stock  immediately  following
the Closing. The "last mile" is generally referred to as the connection from the
termination of a fiber optical ring to a user's computer. However, deploying the
fiber optic lines to  end-users  is  currently  too  expensive to be a realistic
option for most consumers. In response to this problem,  existing telephone line
and television cable network became delivery mediums of broadband service in the
name of DSL and cable modem Internet access. Gridline believes that delivering a
large  bandwidth by means of the telephone line is the most  practical  solution
for Internet access to most end-users, given the fact that putting optical cable
in every home and  business  location  is  expensive  and time  consuming.  This
technology  developed  by iGate has evolved  around a  combination  of low power
differential  electrical  signals,  improved  common-mode  noise  management and
auto-equalization processes. The current iGate technology supports the transport
of two way  high-speed  data  rates of up to 52 Mbps over one mile,  and 20 Mbps
over three miles.


                                      -19-

         These  technologies  integrate power line  communications  technologies
with  fiber-optic  based  access,   dedicated  phone  lines,   cable  television
signaling,  and IP based  signaling  protocol,  to deliver a proprietary  set of
"bundled  telecommunications  technologies"  that  will  include  the  following
services:

         o        POTS, or plain old telephone service;

         o        information monitoring and control services,  such as remotely
                  monitored  security  systems,  home  and  building  management
                  systems,   telemedicine   services  for  remote  diagnosis  of
                  patients'  symptoms,  and long distance  educational  learning
                  services;

         o        video teleconferencing;

         o        multimedia teleconferencing,  with voice, video, graphics, and
                  electronic file transfer, etc.;

         o        video-on-demand,  where the  subscriber  customer  requests  a
                  certain TV  programming,  such as a movie, at a time he or she
                  specifies;

         o        database,   information  and  retrieval  services,  for  home,
                  business,   homeland  security,   law  enforcement  and  other
                  security  agencies,  where an individual or agent can access a
                  database from his terminal;

         o        telemarketing   services  for  video  catalogue  shopping  for
                  home-shopping,   business  to   business,   and   business  to
                  residence; and

         o        long distance  learning,  where  students are connected from a
                  remote location, such as their homes, or classroom,  through a
                  one-way video basis, or in a group.

         Other  services that will be available to utility  companies from these
technologies  include, but are not limited to, energy management services,  such
as:

         o        remote and automated meter reading;

         o        spot pricing of electrical energy; and

         o        load balancing.

Remote  meter  readings  and accurate  spot  pricing of  electrical  energy have
already provided saving measures to utility companies, which should subsequently
benefit utility customers.

GRIDLINE COMMUNICATIONS' LOW VOLTAGE SYSTEM

         The  iGate low  voltage  system  can  support  up to 16 to 25  customer
premise  equipment  units.  Gridline's  low  voltage  coupler  hangs  next to an
electric  service  pole.  The  low  voltage  iPLC  coupler  is the  device  that
superimposes  broadband  signals into an 110V electric  power line,  and removes
broadband signals from the same electrical line. This system is VoIP ready, with
optional VoIP equipment.  It can serve  multi-unit homes and buildings with many
apartments or offices.  The proposed data rate for  Gridline's low voltage is 14
Mbps to 25 Mbps,  and can reach up to 2,500 feet.  Gridline's  custumer  premise
equipment is able to obtain  instant access to the Internet and also to the home
network through the power outlet.  Each customer  premise  equipment has its own
security  feature,  due to added  individual key  encryption.  Other features of
customer premise equipment include:


                                      -20-
<PAGE>


         o        packet based data communication; and

         o        readiness   for   service   features   such  as  VoIP,   video
                  conferencing,  video on demand,  and security  monitoring  for
                  homes and offices.

         Gridline has proposed that its  specification  for its customer premise
units will  include the  ability to support  standard  hub and router  hardware.
Other target specification for its customer premise units is:

         o        maximum  data rate of  between  14 Mbps and 25 Mbps,  although
                  practical average data rate will be in the range of 2 Mbps and
                  4 Mbps;

         o        reach of up to 2,500 feet;

         o        channel specific adaptive loading;

         o        forward error correction;

         o        individual encryption;

         o        USB; and

         o        plug and play capabilities with Windows(R).

         A  repeater  is used to relay  frames  between  the PLC  router and the
customer premise equipment.  It is able to automatically  detect an existing PLC
device,  and is anticipated to be easy to install.  The repeater's  data rate is
anticipated to be between 14 Mbps and 25 Mbps, and its data  transmission  limit
is  anticipated  to be up to 2,500 feet.  Gridline  believes that its PLC router
will  be  able to  support  5 to 10  repeaters.  Its  PLC  low  voltage  network
management software and server will be responsible for monitoring and management
of the network and basic remote operation of the network (power reset).  PLC low
voltage network management  software includes iGate's proprietary simple network
management  protocol,  which will be responsible  for  subscriber  registration,
authentication, and activity monitoring.

GRIDLINE COMMUNICATIONS' MEDIUM VOLTAGE SYSTEM

         Gridline's  medium  voltage  system is  distinct  from its low  voltage
configuration  in that it  requires  significantly  more  hardware  than the low
voltage  system.  The hardware  required is relatively  easy to install,  and it
automatically  detects  existing  PLC  devices.   Gridline's  strategic  product
development  partner,  iGate, has indicated its willingness to assist Gridline's
successful entry into the market by assisting Gridline to ensure that Gridline's
products are competitively priced compared to cable modem and DSL.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE

         Under terms of Gridline's new schedule with iGate, both low voltage and
medium  voltage  BPL systems are due for  commercial  pilot  testing by March 1,
2005, with shipment of the commercial  products forty-five (45) days thereafter;
provided that  development  fees in the aggregate amount of $700,000 are paid in
five (5)  installments,  with the final  installment  due March  2005.  To date,
$690,000 has been paid to iGate in development fees for both the low voltage and
medium voltage categories of BPL.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION


                                      -21-
<PAGE>


         Gridline intends to market its products and services  initially through
a network of key industry  participants.  Gridline  believes the  experience and
credibility  of these  participants  will be effective in convincing  utilities,
other telecommunications  services offerors, and home appliance manufacturers to
deploy and  implement  our products and  services.  The recent  additions of key
industry  members to  Gridline's  Technology  Advisory  Board to advise and give
direction and input to Gridline's  executive team will be of significant benefit
in reaching its penetration goals in the PLC market.  Gridline plans to continue
to build its network of industry  influencer/endorsers.  Gridline  plans to seek
immediate  trials of its  products  and services in the PLC market in the fourth
quarter of 2004.

         Gridline's business model is a license and co-operation model. Gridline
proposes to sell or auction  licenses to power companies and sell  cooperatively
its products  and services to power  companies  and other  vendors who will,  in
turn, sell these products and services to end users.  Gridline believes that its
licensees will be attracted by the  opportunity to capture new markets and offer
telecommunications  services to new and existing  customers.  Gridline  believes
that this model will allow it and its  licensees  to become a low cost  provider
for  these   services.   Gridline   intends   to   assemble   and   market   the
telecommunications  system using iGate's system architecture and proprietary PLC
technology  together  with  components  from  major  product  manufacturers  and
distributors,  such as  Siemens.  Gridline  intends  to work  with the  electric
utilities to install these  components as required  throughout  the on the power
grid and on customer premises.  Gridline  anticipates that its utility licensees
will maintain the  relationship  with the end-user,  billing and  collecting for
telecommunications services, electric power or other services.

COMPETITION

         Gridline   anticipates  that  it  will  be  in  competition  with  both
traditional  telecommunications  and ISP companies engaged in providing Internet
services to end-users and related businesses.  Over the past few years, the size
and revenue  potential of the  broadband  market has created a crowded  field of
first  generation  broadband  Internet  companies.  In the United  States,  some
utility  companies are  currently  conducting  trials or tests with  residential
end-users,  in partnership  with early entrants in the PLC market.  Consolidated
Edison, for instance, is working with Current  Technologies,  Inc., and PepCo to
conduct tests in the distribution of broadband Internet access over power lines,
and  substation  monitoring and Ambient  Corporation is currently  collaborating
with a number of electronics utilities.

         To the  knowledge  of  Gridline,  the only  companies  in the  U.S.  to
announce the first large scale  commercial  PLC  deployments  in a U.S. city are
Prospect Street Broadband,  L.L.C. and Ambient Corporation.  Overall, the number
of  participants  in the PLC  market  at this  time is  small.  There  are still
challenges  in terms of cost  estimates to  end-users,  profitability,  speed of
connectivity, and how best the opportunity can be harnessed.

         The  Gridline  approach  is  distinct  from  that  of its  competitors.
Gridline  plans to offer bundled PLC services and products to vendors,  and to a
greater variety of customers. Gridline believes that its proprietary combination
will include the best  technologies  in the PLC industry,  including  components
such as  modems,  chipsets,  MAC and  IP-enabled  software  for  home  appliance
automation,  voice,  video and data,  which will give our  customers an array of
products and services.  Gridline believes that this will enable its customers to
provide new services, which they could not ordinarily provide without Gridline's
suite of PLC  technology  products  and  services.  Gridline  intends to provide
consultation  services with customers to optimize their systems,  by providing a
"best-fit"  suite of products  and services to allow power  companies  and other
customers  to  increase  their  respective  profit  margins.  Finally,  Gridline
believes that its collaboration with iGate will uniquely position it with one of
the leading technological partners for PLC delivery systems.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


         OPPORTUNITY

         Electricity  service  networks form the most  extensive  network in the
world,  with over three billion  worldwide  end-users,  and Gridline expects the
industry  to  continue  to grow in reach and usage.  Power  line  communications
technology  for the  delivery of broadband  is likely to be  successful  because
power lines are already  installed  in most homes and  offices,  and it provides
multipoint  connectivity  for the use with no new cabling  required.  Power line
access also  offers a  point-to-multipoint  connectivity,  which means users can
share  costs of  installation  associated  with PLC  equipment  retooling.  U.S.
federal regulators have preliminarily  approved PLC access technology.  Goals of
the Federal  Communication  Commission  ("FCC") include boosting Internet access
competition, and lowering consumer costs, thereby bridging the digital divide in
less developed  areas,  these goals will be furthered by PLC access  technology.
Power  line  broadband   access  also  holds  the  potential  for  new  business
opportunities   for  utilities,   telecommunications   companies,   PTTs  (post,
telegraph,  and  telecommunications   companies),   cable  operators,  and  home
appliance equipment  manufacturers.  The benefits of PLC access technology could
be extensive, impacting people and industries worldwide. Utilities will have the
opportunity  to  diversify  by adding  new  services  in the  telecommunications
market.  PLC access  companies will be able to solve "last mile" access problems
cheaply and efficiently, without new cabling, thus expanding their revenue base.
Cable  operators  will have an opportunity to provide voice services to existing
customers.

         In developing countries, Gridline believes that PLC could leap-frog the
prevalent broadband technologies. A recent United Nations study has stressed the
importance of eliminating the digital divide,  both within the population of the
advanced countries of the world that are wealthy,  and between the rich and poor
countries of the world.  Although electricity coverage is low in some countries,
and PLC may not  provide an  immediate  solution  with  regard to  bridging  the
digital divide,  national  development  plans of most developing  countries make
electric service a very high priority  compared to the installation of dedicated
copper or digital telephone lines to homes or offices.  PLC technology  provides
the  potential  to vastly  extend  broadband  coverage by having the capacity to
capitalize  upon  the  development  plans to  bring  electricity  to more of the
world's  population.  This  expansion  can be done at a fraction  of the capital
outlay  needed for the new cabling of either  copper wire or fiber  dedicated to
telecommunications.

         In China,  recent  data  indicates  that there are  approximately  nine
phones  for every 100  citizens;  this  represents  a low  hard-wire  line phone
penetration.  However,  there are  approximately  33.5  television  sets per 100
inhabitants,  which signify much higher electricity  coverage in the population.
However, in more advanced countries, the ratio is almost 1:1 for both television
and  hard-wire  line phones.  These  figures show that the  electricity  network
penetration rate is relatively high in emerging economies,  thus the penetration
rate is  comparable  to that of many  advanced  countries,  while  the  landline
telephone  coverage  or  teledensity  is very  low.  Based  upon the  foregoing,
analysts  may draw the  conclusion  that the  effect  of using  the  electricity
network for  telecommunications  would  substantially  increase  teledensity per
population in developing countries of the world. In these countries, governments
and  international   financial  institutions  would  rather  invest  to  provide
electricity first, which will lead to "bundled  communications  services," which
would   include   voice   communication   technology,   rather  than   telephone
communication  lines alone.  By adding voice by means of the Internet,  known as
"voice over IP" or "VoIP," features to PLC,  governments in developing countries
can avoid undertaking highly capital intensive cabling projects for implementing
dedicated hard-wire line cabling, be it copper or fiber-optic.

         MARKET ANALYSIS

         According   to  the   May   2004   revised   statistics   reported   by
www.InternetworldStats.com,  worldwide  Internet user totals  (consisting of 233
countries)  stands at over 785 million users. This represents about 12.2% of the
world's  population,  and a growth rate for the Internet of 106% since 2000. The
region with the highest  penetration  rate is North  America,  with 70.4% of the
population  having  Internet  access.  Africa has the lowest rate of penetration
with 1.4% user access.  Europe has an average  penetration  rate of 29.9%,  with
Sweden with the highest rate of 76.8%. Eastern European countries,  on the other
hand,  registered the lowest  penetration rate for Europe.  Asia has the highest
number of Internet users in the world,  with over 243 million users.  The Middle
East  exhibits the highest  growth rates of 219% for the  four-year  period 2000
through 2004.

         With regard to broadband specifically,  Nielsen/NetRatings,  the global
standard  for Internet  audience  measurement  and  analysis in recent  reports,
indicates that there are 39 million  Americans (13%)  connecting to the Internet
by means of  broadband.  By May  2003,  broadband  users in  American  homes had
increased  49%;  while during the same period  narrowband  users  declined  12%.
Despite  this  higher  growth  rate,  narrowband  users  continue  to  outnumber
broadband  users by a ratio of 3:1; the main reason for the  disparity is price.
However,  Gridline  believes  that  Regulators  see PLC as a means  to  increase
competition,  thereby  lowering  costs to end users,  and  bridging  the digital
divide within the United States.

         The Yankee Group's current estimates of U.S.  households with broadband
will  top 61.5  million  by the year  2008.  In  Europe,  Asia,  and  elsewhere,
broadband usage is also growing.

         SIGNIFICANT BROADBAND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS

         InternetworldStats.com  concluded  that by the end of 2003,  there were
over 100 million broadband lines worldwide, from DSL to cable modems (over cable
TV networks), and over fiber optic cable lines. In 2003, the number of worldwide
broadband  users  increased  from 79.4  million  in the  second  quarter to 84.4
million in the third  quarter.  The VoIP features of broadband are now providing
non-traditional telecommunication companies an opportunity to enter into an area
that  would  have been  extremely  expensive  for them to enter a few years ago.
Companies such as Yahoo!, and others, are providing  inexpensive voice services,
on top of data, to end-users thereby undercutting traditional telecommunications
companies.  DSL is beginning to catch up with narrowband in most countries,  and
only a drastic shift into new and  innovative  services,  such as PLC, will keep
ISPs and other vendors ahead of the competition.  Gridline's  "bundled services"
present  telecommunications   companies,  cable  operators,  utility  companies,
equipment  manufacturers and others a strategic shift into a new basket of value
added services to end-users, and additional revenue streams.

         BROADBAND INDUSTRY REVENUES

         The market research firm Forward Concepts  recently  published a report
on the worldwide revenue  potential of the broadband market,  which includes DSL
and cable  modem  access  technologies.  The  report  projected  total  industry
revenue,  worldwide,  of over $80 billion  annually by 2006, and that the growth
rate will  continue to be very  aggressive,  in spite of the lull that  occurred
during the last two to three years.  The study by Forward Concepts points to the
fact that although the market and revenue for DSL,  cable modem  equipment,  and
semiconductors  has been in a lull in recent  years,  the industry is entering a
new  phase of  opportunity  for the  right  mix of new  products  and  services.
Gridline's goal is to  strategically  center itself by offering the right mix of
"bundled services",  which many analysts have deemed necessary in redefining the
shift for developing new revenue  opportunities  in the industry.  The shift for
new growth opportunities for telecommunications  companies, cable operators, and
equipment   manufacturers  and  chip  makers  is  necessary  for  them  to  stay
competitive in an increasingly  deregulated  industry.  Gridline  believes that,
without this strategic shift, traditional telecommunications companies, cellular
phone companies,  cable companies, and ISPs will see their revenue shrinking and
declining.


                                      -24-
<PAGE>


These service providers must look for new sources of revenue growth by embracing
and offering a new basket of "bundled  services".  Gridline  believes that it is
strategically  imperative  that they be among  those  offering  a new  basket of
"bundled services." Revenue for equipment sales of cable and DSL modems alone is
projected to reach $4 billion annually by 2006 and revenue for sales of chips is
projected  to reach $800  million  annually by 2006.  Much of the  spending  and
investments by  telecommunications  companies,  cable operators,  and ISPs, have
produced shrinking returns in the last three years, and the industry has started
to see the need to  respond  to new  opportunities.  Industry  participants  are
looking for a vertical  solutions  provider that understands their needs and can
deliver  the  complete  basket  of  technology  solutions  that  will  appeal to
end-users  in a cost  effective  manner.  The goal is to  increase  the  average
revenue  per  subscriber.  Gridline  believes  that  its  broadband  PLC  access
technologies offer that possibility to end-users.

EMPLOYEES; OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OFFICES

         Gridline  currently  employs three people in the following  capacities:
Chief Executive Officer, [Chief Financial Officer], and Executive Vice President
of Sales and Marketing.  Gridline considers its relations with its employees and
consultants  to be excellent.  Gridline does not envisage a work  stoppage,  and
none of its potential  employees and  consultants  is  represented by collective
bargaining agreements.  Gridline believes that its future success will depend in
part on our ability to attract,  integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified
personnel,  and upon the  continued  service  of our senior  management  and key
Technology  Advisory  Board  personnel.  None of its key  personnel are bound by
employment  agreements  that prohibit  them from ending their  employment at any
time.  Competition  for  qualified  personnel in its  industry and  geographical
location is intense.  Gridline  cannot  provide  any  assurance  that it will be
successful in  attracting,  integrating,  retaining and  motivating a sufficient
number of qualified employees to conduct its business in the future.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Gridline is not currently subject to any pending legal proceedings.



                           RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         Gridline  has entered into a  Solution(s)  and  Product(s)  Development
Agreement  (the  "DEVELOPMENT  AGREEMENT")  with  iGate  Inc.  ("IGATE"),  dated
effective as of July 16,  2004,  pursuant to which iGate has agreed to develop a
technical  solution and product package to transport  high-speed data over power
lines for both low-voltage and high-voltage systems. Pursuant to the Development
Agreement, as amended, Gridline has obtained the exclusive right to use, market,
sell,  maintain,  and repair  all  patents,  drawings,  parts  lists,  firmware,
engineering change notices,  design notes, and all such data needed to implement
the solutions and services to be delivered by the products that Gridline intends
to manufacture, and includes all local networks for simultaneous, bi-directional
transmission  of video  bandwidth  signals  technology  owned by iGate,  whether
patented or  unpatented.  In exchange  for this  exclusive  right,  Gridline has
agreed to manufacture  100,000 units for each of the next five years.  Under the
Development  Agreement,  Gridline  paid  $700,000  to iGate  during 2004 for the
development  of a  low-voltage  system  and has the  option of  paying  iGate an
additional $500,000 for the development of a mid-voltage system during 2005. The
cost of manufacturing,  installing,  and delivering  service to customers is the
responsibility  of Gridline and is not included in the cost of development  paid
to iGate. Vernon L. Jackson, a Director, co-founder, and substantial stockholder
of  Gridline,  owns a  controlling  interest  in iGate  and  serves as its chief
executive  officer.  Gridline  believes  that the fees  due to iGate  under  the
Development  Agreement  reasonably represent iGate's costs for such products and
services and,  therefore,  that such products and services are provided on terms
no less favorable or onerous to Gridline than those which would be obtained from
unrelated parties.

up phase due to restrictions in hiring  permanent  staff.  Mr. Wine has received
$25,000 for his services to date.

         Mr. Gerard Werner, the Registrant's current president,  chief executive
officer and director has entered into a consulting  agreement  with  Gridline (a
copy of which is attached  hereto as Exhibit  10.6).  Commencing the date of the
Closing, Mr. Werner will provide consulting services to Gridline for six months.
Mr.  Werner  will  receive  $50,000  as  consideration  of  performance  of  his
consulting services.



                         MANAGEMENT'S PLAN OF OPERATIONS

         Management's  Plan of  Operations  and other  portions  of this  report
contain  forward-looking  information  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.
Gridline's  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the
forward-looking  information.  Factors that may cause such differences  include,
but are not limited to,  availability and cost of financial  resources,  product
demand,  market  acceptance and other factors discussed in this report under the
heading  "Risk  Factors".  Management's  Plan of  Operations  should  be read in
conjunction with Gridline's  financial statements and the related notes included
elsewhere in this report.

OVERVIEW

         CORPORATE BACKGROUND

         The  Registrant,  North Shore Capital IV Inc., a Colorado  corporation,
has conducted no operations  and has generated no revenue since its inception in
February,  1999. It is a public shell company that has been seeking to engage in
a business combination with an operating or development stage company.

         Gridline  Communications  Corporation,  a  Delaware  corporation,  is a
development stage company formed in July 2004 to provide integrated distribution
of broadband  telecommunication  and data transmission  through electrical power
lines to residences and businesses. Gridline plans to provide PLC, or BPL, using
existing electric power transmission and distribution lines. PLC technology will
allow Gridline,  through utility  companies,  to send video,  Internet and voice
communications  over  standard  50 or  60  Hz  voltage  frequencies.  Since  its
inception on July 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004, Gridline has recognized no
revenues and recorded a net loss of $497,196.

         PLAN OF OPERATIONS


                                      -26-
<PAGE>


         From  inception  to date,  Gridline  has  been  primarily  involved  in
organizing  the company,  negotiating  vendor and  personnel  contracts,  making
arrangements  for the commercial use and deployment of the iGate  technology and
preliminary  development  of its  initial  customer  base.  Gridline  intends to
negotiate for long-term  contracts with electric utility companies,  competitive
local exchange  carriers ISPs, and cable modem operators.  Under these long-term
contracts,  Gridline expects to deliver  equipment and technical support for the
benefit of its customer and various end-users.

DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY

         Gridline  is in  the  early  stage  of  operation  and,  as  such,  the
relationships  between revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses reflected
in the financial  information  included herein do not represent  future expected
financial relationships.  Gridline expects that such expenses will increase with
the escalation of sales and marketing activities and transaction volumes, but at
a much slower rate of growth than the corresponding  revenue  increase.  Much of
the cost of revenue and operating expenses reflected herein are relatively fixed
costs.  Accordingly,  Gridline believes that, at such stage of operations period
to period comparisons of results of operations are not meaningful.

         Gridline expects to incur significant  expenses without  generating any
revenue,  at least through the installation and completion of initial testing of
its commercial  pilot facility,  which is not  anticipated  before May 15, 2004.
Under terms of Gridline's  new schedule with iGate,  both low voltage and medium
voltage PLC systems are due for commercial  pilot testing by March 1, 2005, with
shipment  of  the  commercial   products  45  days  thereafter;   provided  that
development fees in the amount of $1,400,000 ($700,000 for each system) are paid
in five scheduled  installments,  with the final  installment due March 2005. To
date, Gridline has paid $590,000 to iGate in aggregate  development fees for the
low voltage and medium voltage PLC systems.

            For the  first  half of  2005  and  through  initial  deployment  of
products in its first  commercial  service area,  Gridline  anticipates that its
primary  source of revenue will be a  combination  of fees and  project-specific
grants  from  customers  who  elect to  implement  its PLC  system.  Thereafter,
Gridline expects to receive fees for service from commercial utilities, ISPs and
cable companies for Gridline's  residential  and commercial  data service,  VoIP
operations,  and  Video on  Demand  operation.  Under  terms of its  anticipated
customer licenses,  Gridline anticipates sharing revenue with its customers from
service fees paid by end users,  depending on customer and end-user requirements
and the deployment model adopted by the parties.

         Gridline also anticipates additional costs associated with the addition
of up to five new employees  concurrently with the anticipated completion of its
commercial pilot facility,  and the addition of twelve additional  employees for
the  development of commercial  service areas  thereafter.  Under current plans,
Gridline will need  approximately  $2,000,000 of additional  capital to continue
its  development  operations  and hire and retain such new employees  during the
next  12  months.  Gridline  is  currently  seeking  to  arrange  an  additional
$2,250,000 in bridge  financing to fulfill those needs.  See Managements Plan of
Operations "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" below.

COST OF REVENUES

         Cost of sales will consist of costs of equipment manufactured,  cost of
installation,  maintenance and cost of customer  services  including call center
expenses.  Many  factors are  anticipated  to affect  Gridline's  gross  margin,
including,  but not  limited  to,  volume of  production  orders  placed and the
competitiveness of the broadband products  industry.  Management  currently does
not anticipate that Gridline will operate its own production  facilities,  as it
intends to outsource manufacturing to a third party low cost provider.

EXPENSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

            Gridline's  operating  expenses  for the  period  from  July 1, 2004
(inception)   through   September  30,  2004  were   comprised  of  general  and
administrative  expenses only. Gridline expects to incur significant  additional
expenses before  generating any revenue,  at least through the  installation and
completion of initial  testing of its commercial  pilot  facility,  which is not
anticipated  before May 15,  2004.  General  and  administrative  expenses  were
$197,196 for the quarter ended  September 30, 2004.  These expenses are expected
to increase  significantly  as Gridline adds employees to support its commercial
pilot facility and to deploy its initial commercial service area.

            General  and  administrative  expenses  include  all  corporate  and
administrative  functions  that serve to support  Gridline's  current and future
operations and provide an infrastructure  to support future growth.  Major items
in  this   category   include   management   and  staff   salaries,   traveling,
entertainment, rent/leases and professional services.

         Interest expense,  including finance charges,  relates primarily to its
sale of Gridline's 8% convertible Notes Due September 10, 2005. Gridline expects
interest  expenses to decrease  initially  as notes are  converted to equity and
then for  interest  expense to  increase as the  company  leverages  its equity.
Gridline also expects these  expenses to increase as a requirement  of operating
as a public  company,  and  anticipates  that its sales and marketing costs will
fluctuate as a percentage of revenue due to the addition of sales  personnel and
various marketing activities planned throughout the year.

            Gridline intends to engage in a dedicated  marketing and sales plan,
including  co-marketing  together  with  our  customers  to  end  users,  direct
marketing in trade  publications,  direct mail  programs  for specific  markets,
marketing  through  indirect  sales channels and public  relations.  The initial
campaign,  currently  under way, is designed to expose Gridline and its products
and services to electric  utilities,  ISPs,  cable companies and other potential
customers. After completion of its commercial pilot facility,  Gridline plans to
hire additional sales and marketing  personnel and prepare product brochures and
other  promotional  materials to create awareness among end users concerning the
products and services  provided by the company.  Gridline  incurred no sales and
marketing  expenses  for the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2004,  because its
commercial  products  are  still  being  developed  for sale to  customers,  but
anticipates  expenditures of approximately $1,000,000 in 2005 in connection with
its sales, marketing and public relations efforts.

            Gridline's  principal capital expenditures have been for purposes of
research and  development,  acquisition of capital  equipment and engagement and
retention of personnel.  Gridline  anticipates  relatively high  expenditures in
these  categories to complete the  development  of its products and services for
initial  commercial  deployment.   Gridline  incurred  capital  expenditures  of
$300,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, and anticipates  expenditures
of  approximately  $300,000  in the fourth  quarter of 2004 and  $700,000 in the
first  quarter  of 2005 for  completion  of  commercial  development  of its low
voltage and medium voltage PLC system and  commercial  deployment in its initial
service area.  Gridline  anticipates  continuing  research and  development  and
capital  equipment  expenditures  thereafter as required to deliver products and
services  with the product  features,  quality of service and price  demanded by
customers and end users. As a result,  Gridline anticipates  significant ongoing
research and development and other capital expenditures.

POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS

            In addition to the transitional  nature of revenues and expenditures
resulting  from  Gridline's  status as a  Development  stage  company,  Gridline
expects to experience significant fluctuations in its future quarterly operating
results due to a variety of factors,  many of which are outside of its  control.
Those factors that may adversely affect Gridline's  quarterly  operating results
include: (i) its ability to


                                      -28-
<PAGE>


retain existing customers,  attract new customers at a steady rate, and maintain
customer  satisfaction;  (ii) the  announcement  or  introduction  of new sites,
services, and products by Gridline and its competitors;  (iii) price competition
or higher  prices in the industry;  (iv) the level of use of broadband  Internet
services,  such as those offered by Gridline;  (v) Gridline's ability to upgrade
and develop its systems and  infrastructure  in a timely and  effective  manner;
(vi) technical difficulties,  system downtime, or Internet brownouts;  (vii) the
amount  and timing of  operating  costs and  capital  expenditures  relating  to
expansion  of  Gridline's  business,  operations,  and  infrastructure;   (viii)
government  regulation;  and  (ix)  general  economic  conditions  and  economic
conditions  specific to the  Internet,  the power  industry,  and the  broadband
services industry.

         Due  to  the  foregoing  factors,  in  one  or  more  future  quarters,
Gridline's  operating  results  may fall below the  expectations  of  securities
analysts and  investors.  In such event,  the trading price of the  Registrant's
common stock would likely be materially adversely affected.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; ANTICIPATED EFFECT OF GROWTH

         Below is a brief  description  of  basic  accounting  principles  which
Gridline has adopted in determining its recognition of revenues and expenses, as
well as a brief  description  of the effects that  management  believes that its
anticipated  growth will have on  Gridline's  revenues  and expenses in the next
twelve (12) months.

REVENUES

         Sales   revenue  will  be  recognized  as  services  are  delivered  to
Gridline's  customers.  Gridline may also collect  license fees for the right to
sell services using Gridline's technology and equipment. Rates for such services
are yet to be established. It is anticipated that the rates Gridline charges for
its services will not be regulated by state or federal  regulators,  but this is
yet to be determined.  As of September 30, 2004, Gridline was in its development
phase and had no active  customers.  Management of Gridline expects the services
it sells to fluctuate with the changes in demand from its  customers.  The price
Gridline  charges its customers is also expected to fluctuate as a result of the
current economic situation and its impact on the market. Furthermore, management
expects  sales to grow as the  public  becomes  aware of the  advantages  of PLC
technology  and Gridline  develops its reputation as a provider in the broadband
services and product market.

         Gridline  believes that the essential element of its success will be to
obtain adequate financial  resources to complete the development of its products
and services  for  commercial  use and to market and deliver  such  products and
services to electric  utilities,  ISPs, cable  companies,  and home and business
users.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Gridline's  principal  sources of liquidity  have been cash provided by
offerings of convertible debt securities. Gridline's principal uses of cash have
been for general and  administrative  expenses  and  research  and  development.
Gridline  anticipates  that  these  uses,  as well as  working  capital  and the
acquisition cost of capital equipment, will be its principal uses of cash in the
future.

         Gridline currently has outstanding $690,000 of its 8% convertible notes
due September 10, 2005 (the "NOTES"). The Notes may be prepaid at any time prior
to  maturity  for a cash price equal to the 105% of the face amount of the note,
plus all accrued and unpaid  interest to the redemption  date.  The  outstanding
principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, is
convertible into Gridline common stock at the rate of $0.10 per share. Following
the Transaction,  the Notes may be converted into the number of shares of common
stock of the Registrant  for which the shares of Gridline  common stock that are
issuable  upon  conversion  of such  Notes  could  have  been  exchanged  in the


                                      -29-
<PAGE>


Transaction,  based on the applicable Exchange Ratio. If holders of the Notes do
not elect to convert their Notes on or before  maturity  thereof,  Gridline will
need  to  obtain  additional  financing,  in the  form of  equity,  debt or bank
financing, in order to pay the Notes at maturity.

         Gridline requires substantial additional financing in order to complete
the development phase of the business and implement its business plan.  Gridline
is currently seeking to arrange an additional  $2,250,000 in bridge financing to
fulfill its capital  needs for the next 12 months.  Gridline and the  Registrant
have  recently  been  engaged  in  negotiations   with  financial   institutions
concerning  private equity or mezzanine  debt financing  which would provide the
Registrant  with $3.0 million,  less certain costs of the financing,  to be used
for repayment of Gridline's  proposed  bridge  financing  described  above,  for
repayment of Gridline's outstanding Notes, if holders do not elect to covert all
outstanding  amounts  under  the Notes on or before  maturity,  and for  general
corporate purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that either the Gridline
bridge  financing or the  Registrant's  proposed  institutional  financing  will
occur.   As  the  anticipated   cash  generated  by  Gridline's   operations  is
insufficient  to fund the  growth  requirements,  Gridline  will  need to obtain
additional  funds through third party  financing in the form of equity,  debt or
bank financing.

          In light of the  limited  shareholders'  equity as well as the lack of
operating history of Gridline and the Registrant, there can be no assurance that
either  company  will be able to obtain the  necessary  additional  capital on a
timely  basis or on  acceptable  terms,  if at all, to fund the  development  of
Gridline's  business  or satisfy  its  existing  debts.  In any of such  events,
Gridline's  business  growth and  prospects  would be  materially  and adversely
affected.  As a result of any such  financing,  the holders of the  Registrant's
common stock may experience substantial dilution.

         The  following  factors,  among others,  could cause actual  results to
differ from those  indicated in the above  forward-looking  statements:  pricing
pressures in the industry; a downturn in the economy in general or in the PLC or
broadband products sector; weak demand for its products;  its ability to attract
new  customers;  an increase in  competition  in the market for its products and
services;  and the  ability of some of its new  licensees  to obtain  financing.
These factors, and additional risks and uncertainties not known to Gridline,  or
that it currently  deems  immaterial may impair business  operations,  may cause
Gridline's  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  any   forward-looking
statement.

         Although   Gridline   believes  the   expectations   reflected  in  the
forward-looking  statements are reasonable,  it cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity,  performance or  achievements.  Gridline is under no duty to
update any of the  forward-looking  statements  after the date of this report to
conform them to actual results or to make changes in its expectations.

         Since  inception,  Gridline has generated no revenue and cannot provide
any assurance that it will generate revenue in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         Increases in interest  rates will affect the cost of financing  and may
affect the Company's  ability to obtain  favorable  financing  terms in order to
grow as anticipated.

OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

         Neither the Registrant nor Gridline has any off balance sheet financing
arrangements.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

         Gridline believes that its results of operations are not dependent upon
moderate  changes in inflation rates as it expects it will be able to pass along
component price increases to its customers.


                                      -30-

SEASONALITY
         Gridline does not expect any material seasonality in sales fluctuations
in the market for its products and services.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         In December 2002, the FASB issued  Statement No. 148,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure," which amends FASB Statement
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods
of  transition  for a  voluntary  change  to the  fair  value  based  method  of
accounting for stock-based employee  compensation.  In addition,  this Statement
amends  the  disclosure  requirements  of  Statement  123 to  require  prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial  statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based  employee  compensation  and the effect of the method
used  on  reported  results.  The  transition  guidance  and  annual  disclosure
provisions of Statement 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002,  with earlier  application  permitted  in certain  circumstances.  The
interim  disclosure  provisions are effective for financial  reports  containing
financial  statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The
adoption  of this  statement  did not have a  material  impact on the  Company's
financial  position  or results of  operations  as  Gridline  has not engaged in
either of these activities.

           In May 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,  "Accounting  for Certain
Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of both  Liabilities and Equity."
Statement 150  establishes  standards for how an issuer  classifies and measures
certain  financial  instrument  with  characteristics  of both  liabilities  and
equity. It requires that issuers classify a financial  instrument that is within
its  scope as a  liability  (or an asset in some  circumstances).  Many of those
instruments were previously classified as equity. Some of the provisions of this
Statement with the definitions of liabilities in FASB Concepts  Statement No. 6,
"Elements of Financial  Statements." The remaining  provisions of this Statement
are consistent with the Board's  proposal to revise that definition to encompass
certain  obligations  that a reporting  entity can or must settle by issuing its
own  equity  shares,  depending  on the nature of the  relationship  established
between  the holder and the  issuer.  While the Board still plans to revise that
definition  through an amendment until it has concluded its deliberations on the
next phase of this  project.  That next phase  will deal with  certain  compound
financial  instrument  including  puttable shares,  convertible  bonds, and dual
indexed  financial  instruments.  This  Statement  is  effective  for  financial
instruments  entered  into  modified  after  June 30,  2003,  and  otherwise  is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period  beginning after June 15,
2003,  except for  mandatory  redeemable  financial  instruments  of  non-public
entities. Gridline does not expect adoption of this statement to have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations.

                                  RISK FACTORS

         SET  FORTH  BELOW  ARE A NUMBER  OF RISKS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  GRIDLINE'S
BUSINESS  UPON  CONSUMMATION  OF THE  CLOSING  AND  WITH ANY  INVESTMENT  IN THE
REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  STOCK.  IN ADDITION TO THE  FOLLOWING  RISKS,  AN INVESTOR
SHOULD BE MINDFUL  THAT  BUSINESSES  ARE OFTEN  SUBJECT TO RISKS NOT FORESEEN BY
MANAGEMENT.  ACCORDINGLY,  IN  REVIEWING  THIS  CURRENT  REPORT ON FORM 8-K, THE
READER SHOULD KEEP IN MIND OTHER RISKS THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT.

         ANY INVESTMENT IN THE  REGISTRANT  FOLLOWING THE CLOSING IS SPECULATIVE
AND  INVOLVES  A HIGH  DEGREE OF RISK.  EACH  PROSPECTIVE  INVESTOR  IS URGED TO
CAREFULLY  CONSIDER THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  DESCRIBED BELOW, IN ADDITION TO
THE RISKS SET FORTH  ELSEWHERE IN THIS CURRENT  REPORT ON FORM 8-K.  WHILE THESE
ARE THE RISKS AND  UNCERTAINTIES  THAT GRIDLINE  BELIEVES ARE MOST  IMPORTANT TO
CONSIDER,  THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE THE ONLY RISKS WHICH GRIDLINE,  OR,  FOLLOWING
THE CLOSING,  THE  REGISTRANT,  MAY FACE. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY
OCCUR FOLLOWING THE CLOSING,  THE BUSINESS,  PROSPECTS,  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD LIKELY SUFFER. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,  THE VALUE OF
THE REGISTRANT COULD DECLINE.

         RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

         GRIDLINE HAS NO OPERATING HISTORY. Gridline has no operating history on
which  to base  an  evaluation  of its  business  and  prospects.  Gridline  was
incorporated  on July 1, 2004, and has been funded with only minimum  capital to
date  in  the  amount  of  $1,078,670.00.  Gridline  has  engaged  primarily  in
finalizing  its  business  plan,   securing  rights  to  essential   technology,
developing  products and services,  and making  arrangements  necessary to begin
operations.   Gridline  has  not  yet  initiated  discussions  with  prospective
customers or strategic  business partners other than its key vendors.  There can
be no assurance  that the recently  assembled  management  group will be able to
successfully  exploit  the assets of  Gridline  and  effectively  implement  its
operating  strategies.  Gridline is subject to the general business risk factors
that similar  development stage companies  experience with the  responsibilities
and complexities  attendant to a new organization,  including (i) the ability to
attract  and  maintain  competent  and  experienced   management  and  operating
personnel,  (ii) the ability to secure  appropriate  debt and equity  capital to
finance  desired growth,  and (iii) the efficient  management and performance of
its operations.  Gridline's  prospects must be considered in light of the risks,
expenses and  difficulties  frequently  encountered  by technology  companies in
their early stages of development. Gridline cannot provide any assurance that it
will be  successful  in  addressing  the risks which it may  encounter,  and its
failure  to do so  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  its  business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

         THE  FUTURE  OF  GRIDLINE  IS  ENTIRELY  DEPENDENT  ON  THE  SUCCESSFUL
DEVELOPMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGY,  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  Gridline is in the early
stages of the development of its PLC technology  (consisting of bundled products
and services) for electricity  utilities,  cable  operators,  home equipment and
appliance manufacturers,  and telecommunications and telecom value added service
providers.  There is no assurance  that when we complete  development of our PLC
technology  that these  companies  and  consumers  will embrace its products and
services,  nor that its products and  services  perform as expected.  Gridline's
vendors in this  product/technology  development  venture are iGate, a leader in
the design  and  development  of  broadband  products  over  existing  wire line
infrastructure,   and  Siemens   Corporation,   the  supply  chain  manager  and
manufacturer of iGate's iB2210 Broadband product  platform.  Gridline intends to
add functionality and features to power line technology products. Its ability to
continue   operations  will  depend  on  the  success  of  its  development  and
integration of leading edge technology  products and services for home appliance
manufacturers,  ISPs,  global  telecommunications  carriers,  CATV,  and certain
government  agencies.  There  can  be no  assurance  that  the  development  and
integration of Gridline's products with these industries will be successful.


                                      -32-
<PAGE>


         THE MARKET  ACCEPTANCE  OF BUNDLED  TECHNOLOGY  SOLUTIONS IS UNCERTAIN.
Even if Gridline is successful in the development of its PLC technology package,
its success will depend upon the acceptance by the various industries  discussed
above in meeting their technology needs. Gridline believes that successful field
trials  and  proof  of the  development  of its  suite of PLC  services  will be
essential for successful  marketing of its products and services,  and there can
be no assurance that any such trials or proof will be successfully obtained. Any
of the factors described above, as well as unanticipated factors, could limit or
detract  from  market  acceptance  of  our  technologies.   Insufficient  market
acceptance of these products and services  would have a material  adverse effect
on  Gridline's  business,   prospects,   financial  condition,  and  results  of
operations.

         GRIDLINE HAS LIMITED  CAPITAL AND WILL NEED  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL IN THE
FUTURE. GRIDLINE WILL INCUR LOSSES ONCE IT BEGINS OPERATIONS WHICH WILL CONTINUE
FOR  THE  FORESEEABLE  FUTURE.   Gridline's  available  resources  will  not  be
sufficient, without additional financing, to achieve commercial operation of its
initial PLC system.  Once  Gridline  commences  operations,  it expects to incur
operating  losses  until  it  has  completed  development  of its  products  and
services,  negotiated  a number of customer  contracts  on  favorable  terms and
successfully served such customer accounts.  Although our strategic vendors have
fully  developed  much  of the  technology  to be  used  by  Gridline,  Gridline
anticipates that it will incur significant development costs before its suite of
services can be offered to customers.  During this period, Gridline expects that
it will incur significant losses. The size of these losses will depend, in part,
on the time required to complete such  development and the rate of growth in its
one-time and monthly  revenues from utilities and other  companies.  The size of
its future losses may also be impacted by non-cash  stock-based charges relating
to deferred stock-based  compensation,  stock option issuances, and amortization
of  intangible  assets.  Gridline  also  intends to spend  significant  funds on
marketing initiatives to develop brand awareness in the business-to-business and
business-to-consumer  segments of its business.  Therefore, Gridline expects its
operating  expenses  to increase  significantly  in future  years.  As a result,
Gridline  may never  achieve or sustain  profitability,  and, if it does achieve
profitability  in any  period,  it may  not  be  able  to  sustain  or  increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

         GRIDLINE  WILL NEED TO EXPAND ITS SKILLED  PERSONNEL AT ALL LEVELS IN A
LABOR MARKET THAT IS EXTREMELY  TIGHT AS WELL AS RETAIN THE THOSE PERSONNEL THAT
IT HIRES.  Gridline will be required to hire and retain skilled employees at all
levels of its operations in a market where such qualified  employees are in high
demand and are subject to  receiving  competing  offers.  The  inability to hire
needed  employees on a timely basis and/or the inability to retain those that it
does hire  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on its  ability  to meet the
schedules of its strategic plan.

         GRIDLINE WILL NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE HIGH GROWTH RATES IN ORDER TO
SUCCEED. Gridline plans on growing at a rapid pace, which will require, in part,
the frequent  addition of new personnel in all areas of its operations.  Even if
Gridline is successful in finding and hiring the  appropriate  personnel,  there
will be a significant strain placed on its managerial, operation, reporting, and
financial resources.  Gridline is considering preliminary steps to establish the
necessary legal, accounting,  human resource management, and other relationships
and tools that will enable it to  efficiently  deal with this  growth.  However,
Gridline can provide no assurance  that it will be able to  successfully  manage
this rapid growth.

         GRIDLINE  MAY  BE  UNABLE  TO  NEGOTIATE  FLEXIBLE  VENDOR  AGREEMENTS.
Gridline  must  reach  agreements  with  third  parties  to  supply  it with the
hardware,  software,  and infrastructure  necessary to provide its services, and
the loss of access to this hardware,  software or  infrastructure or any decline
or  obsolescence  in  functionality  could cause its  customers'  businesses  to
suffer,  which,  in turn,  could  decrease  its revenues and increase our costs.
Gridline believes that strategic vendor relationships,  such as the relationship
with iGate,  will be critical to its success.  Gridline cannot provide assurance
that these  relationships can be maintained or obtained on terms favorable to it
and its stockholders. Gridline's success depends substantially on developing and
maintaining   relationships  with  strategic  partners,  such  as  suppliers  of
subscriber's customer premise and other equipments, and software. If Gridline is
unable to


                                      -33-
<PAGE>


obtain or maintain its  relationship  with  strategic  partners,  its  business,
prospects,  financial  condition,  and results of operations would be materially
adversely affected.

         GRIDLINE IS DEPENDENT ON CERTAIN KEY  PERSONNEL.  Gridline is dependent
on the services of several key personnel,  including Blaize N. Kaduru, its Chief
Executive  Officer  and  co-founder,  Duncan E.  Wine,  its Board  Chairman  and
co-founder, and Vernon Jackson, a director. The loss of services of any of these
individuals could impair Gridline's  ability to complete the national rollout of
its products  and services to a  significant  level of consumer  acceptance  and
could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Gridline's  business,  prospects,
financial condition, and results of operations.

         GRIDLINE MAY BE IMPACTED BY GENERAL  ECONOMIC AND SECURITY  CONDITIONS.
The  telecommunications  and  Internet  technology  sectors are  susceptible  to
negative  trends  in  the  international,   national,  and  regional  economies,
including downward pricing pressure caused by over capacity in the industry. The
success of  Gridline's  business  will depend,  in part, on a number of factors,
including the absorption rate for new  telecommunications  capacity and spending
patterns in the overall  economy.  There is also the  uncertainty  of threats of
terrorism  directed at U.S.  interests,  within U.S.  borders and abroad.  These
factors may adversely affect the telecommunications and technology industry as a
whole and could have an adverse impact on Gridline's  ability to grow or achieve
financial profitability.

         THE RATES  GRIDLINE  CHARGES FOR OUR  SERVICES  MAY DECLINE  OVER TIME,
WHICH WOULD REDUCE ITS  REVENUES  AND  ADVERSELY  AFFECT ITS  PROFITABILITY.  As
Gridline's  business  model gains  acceptance  and  attracts  the  attention  of
competitors,  Gridline  may  experience  pressure to  decrease  the fees for its
services,  which  could  adversely  affect its  revenues  and gross  margin.  If
Gridline is unable to sell its  services at  profitable  prices,  or if gridline
fails to offer additional  services that achieve sufficient profit margins,  its
revenue  growth will slow and its  business  and  financial  results will suffer
materially.

         GRIDLINE MUST DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MARKET ITS PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES TO UTILITY  COMPANIES.  As the anticipated price that Gridline plans to
charge for products and services sold to utility  companies is  relatively  low,
Gridline will depend on obtaining sales from a large number of these  customers.
It may be  difficult  to reach and enroll new  subscribers  on a  cost-effective
basis. In addition, Gridline expects that its sales personnel generally will not
be able to efficiently contact subscribers for telecommunications services on an
individual  basis  and  instead  must rely on sales  presentations  to groups of
executives  who  operate  utility  companies.  Therefore,  even if a  particular
utility  company uses its products and services,  its  customers and  affiliated
entities may decide not to use them.

         GRIDLINE   MUST  OBTAIN  TRIALS  AND  PROOF  OF  CONCEPT  FOR  ITS  PLC
TECHNOLOGY.  Gridline  believes  that its  success  depends in large part on the
number of requests for trials and proofs of concept  received from utilities and
other companies that may find the need for its PLC technology. If the management
of large utilities  chooses to develop  similar  technologies  internally,  then
Gridlines  products  and  services  may become  less  attractive  to  utilities,
equipment  and  appliance  manufacturers,  and other  industry  participants  or
consumers.

         IT  IS  IMPORTANT  TO  ITS  SUCCESS  THAT  GRIDLINE  SUPPORTS  INDUSTRY
PARTICIPANTS.  Since many  utility  companies  are not  sophisticated  regarding
recent advances and  developments  that have occurred in the  telecommunications
industry as it had evolved in the preceding years,  Gridline believes that it is
important  that  these  companies  find  that  its  products  and  services  are
significant  enough to diversify their revenue base with only minimal additional
capital,  manpower, and infrastructure  development outlay. To meet these needs,
Gridline  intends to provide  customer  training and develop a customer  support
organization that seeks to respond to customer inquiries as quickly as possible.
As  its  customer  base  grows,   Gridline  may  need  to  expand  this  support
organization to maintain satisfactory customer support levels. If Gridline needs
to enlarge the support organization, Gridline would incur higher overhead costs.
If Gridline  does not maintain  adequate  support  levels,  these  customers may
choose to discontinue using its service.


                                      -34-
<PAGE>


         THE  MARKET  FOR  BROADBAND  TECHNOLOGY  ACCESS  DELIVERY  AND  RELATED
SERVICES IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE. Gridline's products and services compete with
products and services offered by a number of other entities,  many of which have
long operating histories and are much better capitalized than Gridline. Gridline
expects new competitors to enter its market in the future;  this is the combined
effect of Gridline having not yet obtained patents for its technology that would
bar  competitors  from  entering the market and the  relatively  low barriers to
entry in the  market.  However,  Gridline  plans to protect  its  technology  by
defending its  proprietary  rights of ownership and seeking patents for specific
aspects of its technology.  Although PLC access  technology is still a new area,
the barriers to entry for broadband  telecommunications  services and businesses
overall are low, making it possible for new competitors to proliferate  rapidly.
Many of Gridline's  existing and  potential  competitors  have longer  operating
histories  in  the  telecommunications   and  Internet  markets,   greater  name
recognition,   larger  consumer  bases,  and  significantly  greater  financial,
technical, and marketing resources than Gridline. Additionally, if and when they
decide  they are  going to  venture  into  this  area of the  industry,  some of
Gridline's competitors may be able to provide customers with additional benefits
at lower overall costs in an effort to increase market share. Gridline cannot be
sure  that  it  will  be  able  to  match  cost  reductions  implemented  by its
competitors.   Its   competitors   and  other   companies  may  form   strategic
relationships with each other to compete with Gridline.  These relationships may
take the form of strategic alliances,  joint-marketing  agreements,  licenses or
other contractual  arrangements,  these  arrangements may increase  competitors'
ability to address  customer  needs with their  product and  service  offerings.
Gridline  believes that there is likely to be  consolidation  in its prospective
markets,  which could lead to  increased  price  competition  and other forms of
competition that could cause its business to suffer.

         IN ORDER TO REMAIN  COMPETITIVE,  GRIDLINE WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONTINUE
TO DEVELOP ITS TECHNOLOGY AND DIVERSIFY ITS PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. To be
competitive,  Gridline  must  continue  to enhance  and improve the ease of use,
responsiveness,  functionality and features of its PLC technology. These efforts
may  require  it to  internally  develop  or  to  license  increasingly  complex
technologies.  In  addition,  many  companies  are  continually  developing  and
frequently  introduce new Internet-related  broadband access products,  services
and  technologies,  which will  require  it to update or modify its  technology.
Developing  and  integrating  new products,  services or  technologies  into its
business  model  could  be  expensive  and  time  consuming.  Any new  features,
functions or services  may not achieve  market  acceptance  or enhance its brand
loyalty.  Additionally,  Gridline has not completed  development  and testing of
certain of its proposed PLC technological features. If Gridline fails to develop
and  introduce or acquire  these  features or other new  features,  functions or
services effectively and on a timely basis, Gridline may not continue to attract
new customers and may be unable to retain its existing  clientele.  Furthermore,
Gridline may not succeed in incorporating new PLC technologies,  or in doing so,
Gridline may incur substantial expenses.

         GRIDLINE'S  BUSINESS IS  DEPENDENT  ON THE  STRENGTH  OF THE  HIGH-TECH
INDUSTRY,  WHICH IS BOTH  CYCLICAL  AND  SEASONAL.  The  high-tech  industry has
historically been cyclical.  During the 1990s and up to the latter part of 2000,
there was a boom in the high-tech  sector  "dot.com  era" in the United  States,
with stock prices at  historically  high levels.  In April 2000 the price bubble
burst for high tech  equities,  led by  over-inflated  dot.com  companies.  Many
believe that this adversely  affected real growth in the U.S. economy.  By 2001,
economic  reports  indicated  that the rate of  growth in the U.S.  economy  had
slowed  measurably.  Swings in the technology  industry may be caused by various
factors.  When interest rates are high or general  national and global  economic
conditions  are or are  perceived  to be weak,  there is  typically  less  sales
activity in the technology  sector.  A decrease in the current level of sales of
technology  related  products and services could adversely affect demand for its
PLC  products  and  services.  Gridline may  experience  seasonality  in its PLC
business.  The technology industry typically  experiences a decrease in activity
during the last quarter of each year as the holiday season approaches.  However,
because of its lack of operating history,  Gridline does not know if or when any
seasonal  pattern will develop relating to its products and services or the size
or the nature of any seasonal pattern in its business.


                                      -35-
<PAGE>


         GRIDLINE IS EFFECTIVELY  CONTROLLED BY ITS PRINCIPAL  STOCKHOLDERS  AND
MANAGEMENT,  WHICH MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE  STOCKHOLDER MATTERS OR TO
RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR ITS SHARES  THROUGH A CHANGE IN CONTROL.  Commencing  upon
the  Closing,  the  executive  officers,  directors,   advisers,  and  principal
stockholders of Gridline and their  affiliates will own 95.5% of the outstanding
shares of NSC Common  Stock.  As a result,  they will  effectively  control  the
Registrant and direct its affairs and have significant influence in the election
of directors and approval of significant corporate  transactions.  The interests
of these  stockholders  may  conflict  with  those of other  stockholders.  This
concentration of ownership may also delay, defer, or prevent a change in control
of the  Registrant  and some  transactions  may be more  difficult or impossible
without the support of these stockholders.

         GRIDLINE  WILL NEED TO RAISE  ADDITIONAL  FINANCING IN THE  FORESEEABLE
FUTURE TO FUND ITS  OPERATIONS,  WHICH MAY NOT BE  AVAILABLE  TO IT ON FAVORABLE
TERMS OR AT ALL. Gridline will need to raise significant  additional  capital in
the future to fund  continued  operations.  Gridline  expects  that it will need
additional  funding at some point within  approximately  12 months following the
Closing,  and  potentially  sooner  depending  on the  risks  and  uncertainties
associated  with its business  and inherent in its rapidly  growing and evolving
industry.  Following the Closing,  Gridline intends to raise additional  capital
through  one or more  private  placement  or public  offering  transactions.  In
addition,  Gridline  may  desire to raise  additional  financing  at times  when
Gridline  believes  terms are  favorable  and it is  advantageous  to its growth
strategy. Gridline will require additional financing to:

         o        Further  develop  products and services that Gridline plans to
                  offer to member affiliate groups;

         o        Fund additional marketing expenditures;

         o        Hire additional personnel;

         o        Respond to competitive pressures; and

         o        Fund working capital.

If  Gridline  raises   additional  funds  through  the  issuance  of  equity  or
convertible  debt  securities,  it will reduce the  percentage  ownership of its
stockholders.  Gridline can provide no assurance that additional  financing will
be  available  on terms  favorable  to it, or at all.  The  terms of  securities
Gridline issues in the future could also impose  restrictions on its operations.
If adequate  funds are not available or are not  available on acceptable  terms,
its  ability  to  fund  its  operations,  to  take  advantage  of  unanticipated
opportunities,  to develop or enhance its products and services, or to otherwise
respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.

BROADBAND INTERNET INDUSTRY RISKS

         GRIDLINE  DEPENDS ON INCREASED USE OF THE BROADBAND  INTERNET ACCESS TO
EXPAND  PLC-RELATED  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  "Broadband  Internet" refers to the
capability  of an internet  communications  system to transmit and receive large
quantities  of data at high rates of speed  (typically  at rates  exceeding  385
kilobits per second  ("Kbps").  If broadband  Internet service fails to become a
viable  marketplace  for  business  to  business,  business  to  consumers,  and
consumers to business  content and  information,  its business  will not expand.
Increasing and broad acceptance and adoption of broadband  Internet by consumers
and businesses  will only occur if the broadband  Internet  access provides them
with greater  efficiencies,  technological  innovations,  and improved access to
information at competitive costs.

         GOVERNMENT   REGULATIONS  AND  LEGAL  UNCERTAINTIES  COULD  AFFECT  THE
IMPLEMENTATION  OF PLC  TECHNOLOGY.  A  number  of  legislative  and  regulatory
proposals under consideration by federal, state, local,


                                      -36-
<PAGE>


and  foreign  governmental   organizations  may  lead  to  laws  or  regulations
concerning  various  aspects of the Internet,  including  online  content,  user
privacy, access charges,  liability for third-party activities, and jurisdiction
issues. Additionally, it is uncertain as to how existing laws will be applied to
the Internet.  The adoption of new laws or the  application of existing laws may
decrease the growth in the use of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the
usage and demand for its services or increase its cost of doing  business.  Some
local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of
the Internet have burdened the existing telecommunications  infrastructure,  and
that many areas with high Internet usage have begun to experience  interruptions
in telephone service.  These carriers have petitioned the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to impose access fees on Internet service  providers and online
service providers. If access fees are imposed, the costs of communicating on the
Internet could increase substantially, potentially slowing the increasing use of
the  Internet.  This result  could in turn  decrease  demand for its services or
increase its cost of doing business.

         The future tax  treatment of the Internet  and  electronic  commerce is
currently unsettled. A number of proposals have been made at the federal, state,
and local level and by various  foreign  governments to impose taxes on the sale
of goods and services and other Internet activities.  Recently, the Internet Tax
Information Act was signed into law placing a three-year moratorium on new state
and local taxes on Internet commerce.  However,  future laws may impose taxes or
other regulations on Internet  commerce,  which could  substantially  impair the
growth of electronic commerce.

         GRIDLINE'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH
ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS BUSINESS  OBJECTIVES.  The FCC has  recognized  that all
citizens  of the  United  States  need  reliable  and  affordable  access to the
Internet  services,  and that a disparity in Internet access still exists in the
population.  Broadband power line access or PLC  technology,  though it has been
technically  feasible for quite sometime,  is a possible technology for bridging
the  "digital  divide."  Certain  organizations  and  individuals  have  opposed
allowing PLC access over power lines on grounds that it creates  electromagnetic
interference  problems.  The American Radio Relay League (ARRL),  a national ham
radio association,  for example, has raised concerns with the FCC that broadband
telecommunications   over  power  lines  will  disrupt  their  short-wave  radio
transmission.  Also,  the Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency (FEMA) had also
expressed  concerns to the FCC that  unlicensed  PLC equipment  interferes  with
their  licensed  radio  signals.  Although,  the FCC's  posture  is that all the
concern  issues can be addressed  and  accommodated  by PLC  operators,  and PLC
equipment  vendors,  the FCC has  announced  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking
concerning  amendment of Part 15 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
This  rulemaking   concerns  new   requirements  and  guidelines  for  broadband
telecommunications  over power line systems.  The FCC  recognizes  the fact that
licensed radio services must be protected from harmful  interference that may be
caused by access  broadband over power line  developments.  Thus, two conditions
must exist for all Part 15 intentional radiating devices:

         o        This device may not cause harmful interference.

         o        This device must accept any interference  received,  including
                  interference that may cause undesired operation.

Several trials during the last two years have shown that with newer  modulations
techniques,  interference  is no longer a problem  with PLC.  Although  Gridline
believes that its broadband  power line  technology  will conform to the FCC "no
interference"  standards,  this has not been proven  conclusively  to date,  and
although  Gridline  anticipates  further FCC  rulemaking,  Gridline is unable to
determine  what  new  rules  the  FCC may  publish  regarding  requirements  and
measurement  for broadband  access over power line  systems.  If the FCC were to
find interference in its access PLC systems during trials and elected to enforce
certain of its existing "no  interference"  rules,  Gridline  could be forced to
discontinue providing its products and services.


                                      -37-
<PAGE>


         GRIDLINE DEPENDS ON CONTINUED  IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS COMPUTER NETWORK AND
THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE INTERNET.  Any failure of its  infrastructure  systems
that causes  interruption  or slower  response time of  Gridline's  web sites or
services could result in a smaller number of users of its services. If sustained
or repeated,  these  performance  issues could reduce the  attractiveness of its
technologies to consumers of its products and services.  Increases in the volume
of  traffic   could  also  strain  the   capacity  of  its   existing   Internet
infrastructure  systems,  which  could lead to slower  response  times or system
failures. This result would cause the number of search inquiries,  other revenue
producing  offerings,  and its informational  offerings to decline, any of which
could hurt its revenue growth and its brand loyalty.  Gridline may need to incur
additional costs to upgrade its  infrastructure  systems in order to accommodate
increased  demand if its  systems  cannot  handle  current or higher  volumes of
traffic.  The recent growth in Internet  traffic has caused frequent  periods of
decreased  performance.  Its ability to increase  the speed with which  Gridline
provides  services to consumers  and to increase the scope of these  services is
limited by and dependent upon the speed and  reliability  of many  components of
the Internet outside of its PLC system.  Consequently,  the emergence and growth
of the market for its  services is dependent  on the  performance  of and future
improvements to the Internet.

         GRIDLINE'S   INTERNAL  NETWORK   INFRASTRUCTURE   COULD  BE  DISRUPTED.
Gridline's  operations  depend  upon its  ability to  maintain  and  protect its
computer  systems.  The systems  may be  vulnerable  to damage  from  break-ins,
unauthorized    access,    vandalism,    fire,    earthquakes,    power    loss,
telecommunications  failures  and similar  events.  Although  Gridline  hopes to
maintain insurance against fires and general business interruptions,  the amount
of coverage may not be adequate in any  particular  case.  Experienced  computer
programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate its network security from time
to  time.  A  hacker  who   penetrates   Gridline's   network   security   could
misappropriate  proprietary  information or cause interruptions in its services.
Gridline  might be  required to expend  significant  capital  and  resources  to
protect against, or to alleviate,  problems caused by hackers. Gridline also may
not have a timely  remedy  against a hacker who is able to penetrate its network
security.   In  addition  to  purposeful  security  breaches,   the  inadvertent
transmission  of computer  viruses  could expose  Gridline to litigation or to a
material risk of loss.

         GRIDLINE COULD FACE LIABILITY FOR INFORMATION ON GRIDLINE WEB SITES AND
FOR PRODUCTS  AND SERVICES  SOLD OVER THE  INTERNET.  Gridline  hopes to provide
third-party  content on Gridline  web site,  particularly  product  advertising.
Gridline  could  be  exposed  to  liability  with  respect  to this  third-party
information.  If  Gridline  provides  links  to the  third-party  websites  from
Gridline's  website,  Gridline  may be a  defendant  with  respect to claims for
copyright  or  trademark  infringement  or other  wrongful  actions of the third
parties  operating  those  websites.   Claimants  might  also  assert  that  its
third-party  information contains errors or omissions,  and consumers could seek
damages for losses  incurred if they rely upon incorrect  information.  Gridline
may enter into  agreements with other companies under which Gridline shares with
these other companies'  revenues resulting from the purchase of services through
direct  links to joint  venture  partnerships.  These  arrangements  may  expose
Gridline to additional legal risks and  uncertainties,  including local,  state,
federal,  and  foreign  government   regulation  and  potential  liabilities  to
consumers  of these  services,  even if Gridline  does not provide the  services
itself.  Gridline cannot provide assurance that any indemnification  provided to
it in its agreements with these parties, if available, will be adequate. Even if
these claims do not result in liability to it, Gridline could incur  significant
costs in investigating  and defending  against these claims.  General  liability
insurance, if purchased by Gridline, may not cover all potential claims to which
Gridline is exposed and may not be adequate to  indemnify  it for all  liability
that may be imposed.
