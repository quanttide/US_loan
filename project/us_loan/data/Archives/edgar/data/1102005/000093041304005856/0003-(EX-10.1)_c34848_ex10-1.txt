SHARE EXCHANGE AND REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT,  dated as of December 15, 2004 (the
"AGREEMENT"),  between NORTH SHORE CAPITAL IV, INC., a Colorado corporation with
offices located at 2209 Pershing  Avenue,  Sheboygan,  Wisconsin 53083 (together
with  its  successor  in  interest  as  a  result  of  the  Reincorporation,  as
hereinafter  defined,  "NSC");  and GRIDLINE  COMMUNICATIONS  CORP.,  a Delaware
corporation  with offices located at 14090 Southwest  Freeway,  Suite 300, Sugar

IDENTIFIED IN SCHEDULE A HERETO (the "GRIDLINE SHAREHOLDERS").

                                  INTRODUCTION

        NSC  desires to acquire  all of the  issued  and  outstanding  shares of
Gridline capital stock (the "GRIDLINE  CAPITAL STOCK") solely in exchange for an
aggregate of 47,600,000 shares of authorized,  but theretofore unissued,  shares
of common  stock,  par value $0.001 per share (the "NSC COMMON  STOCK"),  of the
newly formed  Delaware  corporation  that is the  successor in interest to North
Shore  Capital  IV,  Inc.,  a  Colorado   corporation,   giving  effect  to  the
Reincorporation  (as defined  below),  representing  approximately  95.5% of the
fully diluted  outstanding NSC Common Stock giving effect to such issuance,  but
without  giving  effect to the issuance of NSC Common Stock upon the exercise or
conversion of certain options,  warrants and convertible securities described on
SCHEDULE B hereto.  The  Gridline  Shareholders  desire to exchange all of their
beneficially  owned  shares of Gridline  Capital  Stock solely for shares of NSC
Common Stock in the amount set forth herein.

        Prior  to the  date  hereof,  the  respective  boards  of  directors  or
analogous  governing  body of each of NSC and  Gridline  have,  and the Gridline
Shareholders  have,  approved and adopted this Agreement and it is the intent of
the parties hereto that the transactions contemplated hereby be structured so as
to qualify as a tax-free  exchange  under  Subchapter C of the Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and the provisions of this Agreement will
be interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent.

        NOW,   THEREFORE,   in   consideration   of  the   premises  and  mutual
representations,  warranties and covenants herein contained,  the parties hereby
agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                       ACQUISITION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES

       SECTION  1.01    THE AGREEMENT.  The parties hereto hereby agree that NSC
shall acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Gridline Capital Stock
solely in exchange for an  aggregate of  47,600,000  shares of  authorized,  but
theretofore unissued,  shares of NSC Common Stock. The parties hereto agree that
at  the  closing  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  (the
"CLOSING"):

                (i)     Gridline  will become a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of NSC
        subject to the conditions and provisions of Section 1.03 hereof;

<PAGE>


                (ii)    North Shore  Capital IV, Inc.,  a Colorada  corporation,
        shall  reincorporate  in the State of Delaware (the  "REINCORPORATION"),
        and  shall  change  its  name  in  connection   therewith  to  "Gridline
        Communications   Corp.  and  cause  its   certificate  and  articles  of
        incorporation  to be in the form of  EXHIBIT  A  hereto  and  cause  its
        by-laws to be in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto; and

                (iii)   NSC shall  assume  each option  (each a "GRIDLINE  STOCK
        OPTION") and each warrant (each a "GRIDLINE WARRANT") outstanding at the
        as of the  Closing  by  executing  and  delivering  to  such  holder  an
        assumption,  which  assumption  shall  read  as  set  forth  in  EXHIBIT
        1.01(iii) hereto,  incorporated in, and made a part of this Agreement by
        this reference  thereto,  and NSC shall be substituted for Gridline with
        respect to each  Gridline  Stock Option or Gridline  Warrant so assumed,
        and thereafter,  until any event that affects the exercise  price,  each
        Gridline Stock Option and Gridline  Warrant  assumed by NSC as aforesaid
        shall represent an option to purchase, instead of Gridline Common Stock,
        the number of whole shares of NSC Common Stock (after  disregarding  all
        fractions)  which  equals the number of shares of Gridline  Common Stock
        subject  to such  option  immediately  prior to the  Closing  divided by
        2.03151261  and the price per share of NSC  Common  Stock at which  such
        option  shall be  exercisable  shall  (until any event that  affects the
        exercise  price) be an amount (to the next  higher  whole cent) equal to
        the option price per share of Gridline Common Stock immediately prior to
        the Closing  multiplied by 2.03151261.  Except as aforesaid,  the period
        during which,  and the terms upon which,  each Gridline Stock Option and
        Gridline Warrant may be exercised shall remain unchanged.

        SECTION 1.02    EXCHANGE OF SHARES.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        SECTION 2.01    REPRESENTATIONS   AND  WARRANTIES  OF  NSC.  NSC  hereby
represents  and  warrants  to,  and  agrees  with,  Gridline  and  the  Gridline
Shareholders as follows:

        (a)     ORGANIZATION  AND  QUALIFICATION.  Other  than as set  forth  in
Section A of the disclosure letter, of even date herewith,  from NSC to Gridline
and  the  Gridline  Shareholders  (the  "NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER"),  NSC  has no
subsidiaries  or  affiliated  corporation  or owns  any  interest  in any  other
enterprise  (whether  or  not  such  enterprise  is  a  corporation).  NSC  is a
corporation  duly organized,  validly  existing,  and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Colorado,  with all requisite power and authority,  and all
necessary consents,  authorizations,  approvals, orders, licenses, certificates,
and permits of and from, and declarations and filings with, all federal,  state,
local, and other governmental authorities and all courts and other tribunals, to
own,  lease,  license,  and use its  properties  and  assets and to carry on the
businesses  in  which  it  is  now  engaged  and  the  businesses  in  which  it
contemplates  engaging.  Commencing  upon the  Reincorporation,  NSC  shall be a
corporation  duly organized,  validly  existing,  and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware,  with all requisite power and authority,  and all
necessary consents,  authorizations,  approvals, orders, licenses, certificates,
and permits of and from, and declarations and filings with, all federal,  state,
local, and other governmental authorities and all courts and other tribunals, to
own,  lease,  license,  and use its  properties  and  assets and to carry on the
businesses  in  which  it  is  now  engaged  and  the  businesses  in  which  it
contemplates  engaging.  Other  than  as set  forth  in  Section  A of  the  NSC
DISCLOSURE  LETTER, NSC is duly qualified to transact the businesses in which it
is  engaged  and  is  in  good  standing  as  a  foreign  corporation  in  every
jurisdiction in which its ownership,  leasing,  licensing, or use of property or
assets or the conduct of its businesses makes such qualification necessary.

                                      -4-

        (b)     CAPITALIZATION.  The authorized capital stock of NSC consists of
50,000,000   shares  of  NSC  Common  Stock,  of  which  2,247,500   shares  are
outstanding,  and  10,000,000  shares of  non-cumulative  convertible  preferred
stock,  par  value  $0.002  per  share,  no  shares  of which  are  outstanding.
Commencing upon the  Reincorporation  and not giving effect to the Closing,  the
authorized  capital  stock of NSC shall  consist  of  230,000,000  shares of NSC
Common Stock,  of which 2,247,500  shares shall be  outstanding,  and 20,000,000
shares of "blank check"  preferred  stock, par value $0.001 per share, no shares
of which shall then be outstanding.  Prior to Closing,  NSC  shareholders  shall
approve  and  caused  to  become  effective  the  Reincorporation.  Each of such
outstanding  shares of NSC Common Stock is validly  authorized,  validly issued,
fully paid, and  nonassessable,  has not been issued and is not owned or held in
violation  of any  preemptive  or  similar  right of  stockholders.  There is no
commitment,  plan, or arrangement to issue, and no outstanding option,  warrant,
or other right calling for the issuance of, any share of capital stock of NSC or
any  security  or  other  instrument   convertible  into,  exercisable  for,  or
exchangeable for capital stock of NSC. There is outstanding no security or other
instrument  convertible  into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock
of NSC.

        (c)     FINANCIAL  CONDITION.  NSC has  filed  with  the  United  States
Securities  and Exchange (the "SEC") true and correct  copies of the  following:
audited balance sheets of NSC as of December 31, 2001, 2002, and 2003; unaudited
balance  sheets of NSC as of September 30, 2003;  audited  statements of income,
statements of stockholders'  equity, and statements of cash flows of NSC for the
years ended December 31, 2001,  2002, and 2003; and the unaudited  statements of
income,  statements of stockholders' equity, and statements of cash flows of NSC
for the nine months  ended  September  30, 2003.  Each such balance  sheet shall
present fairly the financial condition,  assets, liabilities,  and stockholders'
equity of NSC as of its  respective  date;  each such  statement  of income  and
statement of stockholders' equity shall present fairly the results of operations
of NSC for the period  indicated;  and each such  statement  of cash flows shall
present  fairly the  information  purported to be shown  therein.  The financial
statements  referred  to in this  Section  2.01(c)  will have been  prepared  in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the United States
consistently  applied throughout the periods involved and shall be in accordance
with the books and records of NSC. The financial  statements referred to in this
Section 2.01(c) contain all certifications and statements  required by the SEC's
Order,  dated June 27,  2002,  pursuant to Section  21(a)(1) of the Exchange Act
(File No.  4-460),  Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the  Exchange  Act, or 18 U.S.C.
Section  1350  (Sections  302 and 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002)  with
respect to the report relating thereto. Since September 30, 2004:

                (i)     There has at no time been a material  adverse  change in
        the financial condition, results of operations,  businesses, properties,
        assets, liabilities, or future prospects of NSC.

                (ii)    NSC has not authorized,  declared, paid, or effected any
        dividend or liquidating or other  distribution in respect of its capital
        stock  or  any  direct  or  indirect  redemption,   purchase,  or  other
        acquisition of any stock of NSC.

                (iii)   The operations and businesses of NSC have been conducted
        in all respects only in the ordinary course,  except as described in the
        filings  made and to be made by NSC with the SEC and except as otherwise
        described herein.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>


There is no fact  known to NSC  which  materially  adversely  affects  or in the
future (as far as NSC can reasonably  foresee) may materially  adversely  affect
the financial condition, results of operations,  businesses, properties, assets,
liabilities,  or future prospects of NSC; provided,  however, that NSC expresses
no opinion as to political or economic matters of general applicability. NSC has
made known,  or caused to be made known, to the accountants or auditors who have
prepared,   reviewed,  or  audited  the  aforementioned  consolidated  financial
statements  all  material  facts  and  circumstances   which  could  affect  the
preparation, presentation, accuracy, or completeness thereof.

        (d)     TAX AND  OTHER  LIABILITIES.  NSC does  not  have  any  material
liability of any nature, accrued or contingent,  including,  without limitation,
liabilities for federal, state, local, or foreign taxes and penalties, interest,
and additions to tax ("TAXES"), and liabilities to customers or suppliers, other
than the following:

                (i)     Liabilities  for which full  provision  has been made on
        the balance sheet and the notes  thereto (the "LAST NSC BALANCE  SHEET")
        as of September 30, 2004 (the "LAST NSC BALANCE SHEET DATE") referred to
        in Section 2.01(c); and

                (ii)    Other  liabilities  arising  since the Last NSC  Balance
        Sheet  Date and prior to  Closing  in the  ordinary  course of  business
        (which  shall  not  include  liabilities  to  customers  on  account  of
        defective  products or  services)  which are not  inconsistent  with the
        representations  and  warranties  of NSC or any other  provision of this
        Agreement.

Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  the  amounts  set up as
provisions  for  Taxes on the Last NSC  Balance  Sheet  are  sufficient  for all
accrued and unpaid  Taxes of NSC,  whether or not due and payable and whether or
not disputed, under tax laws, as in effect on the Last NSC Balance Sheet Date or
now in  effect,  for the period  ended on such date and for all  fiscal  periods
prior thereto. The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by NSC
will not cause any Taxes to be payable  (other  than those that may  possibly be
payable by the Gridline  Shareholders  as a result of the  contribution of their
shares  of  Gridline  Capital  Stock  to NSC) or  cause  any  lien,  charge,  or
encumbrance  to secure any Taxes to be created  either  immediately  or upon the
nonpayment  of any Taxes other than on the  properties or assets of the Gridline
Shareholders.  The  Internal  Revenue  Service  has  audited  and settled or the
statute of  limitations  has run upon all federal  income tax returns of NSC for
all taxable years up to and including the taxable year ended  December 31, 1997.
NSC has filed all federal,  state, local, and foreign tax returns required to be
filed by it; has delivered to the Gridline  Shareholders a true and correct copy
of each such  return  which was  filed in the past six  years;  has paid (or has
established on the Last NSC Balance Sheet a reserve for) all Taxes, assessments,
and other governmental  charges payable or remittable by it or levied upon it or
its properties, assets, income, or franchises which are due and payable; and has
delivered to the Gridline  Shareholders a true and correct copy of any report as
to  adjustments  received  by it from any taxing  authority  during the past six
years and a statement as to any  litigation,  governmental  or other  proceeding
(formal or informal), or investigation pending,  threatened, or in prospect with
respect to any such report or the subject matter of such report.

        (e)     LITIGATION  AND CLAIMS.  Except as described in Section G of the
NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER, there is no litigation,  arbitration, claim, governmental
or other proceeding  (formal or

                                      -6-
<PAGE>


informal),  or  investigation  pending  or,  to the  best  of  NSC's  knowledge,
threatened,  or in prospect (or any basis therefor known to NSC) with respect to
NSC or any of its businesses,  properties, or assets. NSC is not affected by any
present or threatened  strike or other labor disturbance nor to the knowledge of
NSC, is any union  attempting  to represent  any  employee of NSC as  collective
bargaining agent. NSC is not in violation of, or in default with respect to, any
law, rule,  regulation,  order,  judgment,  or decree which violation or default
would have a material  adverse  effect on NSC;  nor is NSC  required to take any
action in order to avoid such violation or default.

        (f)     PROPERTIES.

                (i)     NSC owns no real  property.  NSC has  good  title to all
personal  properties  and assets  material to NSC and used in its  businesses or
owned by it (except real and other  properties and assets material to NSC as are
held  pursuant  to leases or  licenses  described  in  Section B or C of the NSC
DISCLOSURE LETTER), free and clear of all liens, mortgages,  security interests,
pledges,  charges,  and encumbrances  (except such as are listed in Section D of
the NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER).

                (ii)    Set forth in Section B of the NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER is a
true and  complete  list of all tangible  properties  and assets owned by NSC or
leased or licensed by NSC from or to a third party (including  inventory but not
including  Intangibles  (as  hereinafter  defined)),  and with  respect  to such
properties  and assets  leased or  licensed by NSC from or to a third  party,  a
description of such lease or license.  All such properties and assets (including
Intangibles)  owned by NSC are  reflected on the Last NSC Balance  Sheet (except
for acquisitions  subsequent to the Last NSC Balance Sheet Date and prior to the
Closing  Date,  which are either  noted in Section B or C of the NSC  DISCLOSURE
LETTER or are  approved in writing by  Gridline).  All tangible  properties  and
assets owned by NSC or leased or licensed by NSC from or to a third party are in
good and  usable  condition  (reasonable  wear and tear  which is not such as to
affect adversely the operation of the businesses of NSC excepted).

                (iii)   To the best of NSC's knowledge,  no real property leased
or  licensed  by NSC from or to a third  party lies in an area which is, or will
be, subject to zoning,  use, or building code restrictions which would prohibit,
and, to the best of NSC's  knowledge,  no state of facts relating to the actions
or inaction of another  person or entity or his or its  ownership,  leasing,  or
licensing  of any real or  personal  property  exists or will exist  which would
prevent, the continued effective  ownership,  leasing, or licensing of such real
property  in the  businesses  in which NSC is now engaged or the  businesses  in
which it contemplates engaging.

                (iv)    The properties  and assets  (including  Intangibles  (as
hereinafter  defined))  owned by NSC (other than those leased or licensed by NSC
to a third party) or leased or licensed by NSC from a third party constitute all
such  properties  and assets  which are  necessary to the  businesses  of NSC as
presently conducted.

                (v)     NSC  has  not  caused  or   permitted   its   businesses
properties,  or assets to be used to generate,  manufacture,  refine, transport,
treat, store,  handle,  dispose of, transfer,  produce, or process any Hazardous
Substance  (as such  term is  defined  in this  Section  2.01(f)(v))  except  in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations,  orders, judgments, and

ss.6903(5),  any hazardous substance, as defined by 42 U.S.C.  ss.9601(14),  any
pollutant or  contaminant,  as defined by 42 U.S.C.  ss.9601(33),  and all toxic
substances,  hazardous materials,  or other chemical substances regulated by any
other law,  rule, or regulation.  The term "RELEASE"  shall have the meaning set
forth in 42 U.S.C. ss.9601(22).

        (g)     CONTRACTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS. Section D of the NSC DISCLOSURE
LETTER contains a true and correct  statement of the information  required to be
contained therein regarding material contracts, agreements, instruments, leases,
licenses, arrangements, or understandings with respect to NSC. NSC has furnished
to the Gridline  Shareholders  (i) the  certificate of  incorporation  (or other
charter document) and by-laws of NSC and all amendments thereto, as presently in

descriptions of all material supply,  distribution,  agency, financing, or other
arrangements  or  understandings  referred  to  in  Section  B or C of  the  NSC
DISCLOSURE  LETTER.  To the best of  NSC's  knowledge,  neither  NSC nor (to the
knowledge  of NSC) any other  party to any such  material  contract,  agreement,
instrument, lease, or license is now or expects in the future to be in violation
or breach of, or in default with respect to complying  with,  any term  thereof,
and each such material contract, agreement,  instrument, lease, or license is in
full force and is (to the best of NSC's  knowledge in the case of third parties)
the legal,  valid, and binding obligation of the parties thereto and (subject to
applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency,  and other laws affecting the enforceability
of creditors' rights generally) is enforceable as to them in accordance with its
respective terms. Each such material supply, distribution, agency, financing, or
other  arrangement or  understanding  is a valid and  continuing  arrangement or
understanding;  neither  NSC nor any  other  party  to any such  arrangement  or
understanding  has given notice of termination or taken any action  inconsistent
with the continuance of such  arrangement or  understanding;  and the execution,
delivery,  and  performance  of this  Agreement  will  not  prejudice  any  such
arrangement or  understanding  in any way. NSC enjoys  peaceful and  undisturbed
possession  under all material  leases and licenses under which it is operating.
NSC is not party to, or bound by, any contract,  agreement,  instrument,  lease,
license,  arrangement,  or  understanding,  or subject  to any  charter or other
restriction, which has had or (to the knowledge of NSC) may in the future have a
material  adverse  effect on the  financial  condition,  results of  operations,
businesses, properties, assets, liabilities, or future prospects of NSC. NSC has
not  engaged  within  the last five years in, is not  engaging  in, and does not
intend to engage in any  transaction  with, and has not had within the last five
years,  does not now have,  and does not intend to have any  material  contract,

stockholder  of NSC,  any  director,  officer,  or  employee  of NSC (except for
employment  agreements  listed in  Section D of the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER  and
employment  and  compensation  arrangements  described  in  Section E of the NSC
DISCLOSURE  LETTER),  any relative or affiliate of any  stockholder of NSC or of
any such director,  officer, or employee, or any other corporation or enterprise
in which any stockholder of NSC, any such director, officer, or employee, or any
such relative or affiliate  then had or now has a 5% or greater equity or voting
or other  substantial  interest,  other than those  listed and so  specified  in
Section D of the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER.  The stock ledgers and stock  transfer
books relating to all issuances and transfers of stock

by  NSC  and  the  minute  book  records  of  NSC  and  all  proceedings  of the
stockholders and the Board of Directors and committees  thereof of NSC since its
incorporation   made   available   to  counsel  to  Gridline  and  the  Gridline
Shareholders  are the original stock ledgers and stock transfer books and minute
book records of NSC or exact copies  thereof.  NSC is not in violation or breach
of, or in default with respect to, any term of its certificate of  incorporation
(or other charter  document) or by-laws or its its certificate of  incorporation
(or other charter document) or by-laws commencing upon the Reincorporation.

        (h)     EMPLOYEES.

                (i)     NSC  does not  have,  or  contribute  to,  any  pension,
profit-sharing,  option,  other  incentive  plan,  or any other type of Employee
Benefit  Plan (as  defined in Section  3(3) of the  Employee  Retirement  Income
Security  Act of  1974,  as  amended  ("ERISA")),  or has any  obligation  to or
customary  arrangement  with  employees  for  bonuses,  incentive  compensation,
vacations,  severance  pay,  sick pay,  sick leave,  insurance,  service  award,
relocation,  disability,  tuition  refund,  or other  benefits,  whether oral or
written,  except as set forth in Section E of the NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER. NSC has
furnished to Gridline and the Gridline Shareholders: (A) true and correct copies
of all documents evidencing plans,  obligations,  or arrangements referred to in
Section E of the NSC DISCLOSURE  LETTER (or true and correct written  summaries,
so initialed,  of such plans,  obligations,  or  arrangements  to the extent not
evidenced  by  documents)  and true and correct  copies,  so  initialed,  of all
documents evidencing trusts, summary plan descriptions,  and any other summaries
or  descriptions  relating  to any such plans;  (B) the two most  recent  annual
reports (Form  5500's),  if any,  including  all schedules  thereto and the most
recent  annual and  periodic  accounting  of related plan assets with respect to
each Employee  Benefit Plan; (C) the two most recent  actuarial  valuations with
respect to each Pension  Plan (as defined in Section  3(2) of ERISA)  subject to
Title IV of ERISA;  and (D) the most recent  determination  letter issued by the
Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Pension Plan.

                (ii)    If  any  Employee   Benefit  Plan  of  NSC  were  to  be
terminated on the day prior to Closing Date, (A) no liability  under Title IV of
ERISA  would be incurred by NSC or  Gridline  and (B) all Accrued  Benefits  (as
defined  in this  Section  2.01(h)(ii))  to such day prior to the  Closing  Date
(whether or not vested) would be fully funded in accordance with the assumptions
contained  in  the  regulations  of the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation
governing the funding of terminated  defined benefit plans. For purposes hereof,
"ACCRUED BENEFITS" shall include the value of disability,  pre-retirement, death
benefits,  and all  supplements,  subsidized,  ancillary,  and optional forms of
benefits.  All Accrued  Liabilities (for contributions or otherwise) (as defined
in this  Section  2.01(h)(ii))  of NSC as of the Closing  Date to each  Employee
Benefit Plan and with respect to each  obligation  to, or customary  arrangement
with, employees for bonuses, incentive compensation,  vacations,  severance pay,
sick pay, sick leave, insurance, service award, relocation,  disability, tuition
refund,  or other benefits,  whether oral or written,  have been paid or accrued
for all periods  ending prior to the Closing Date and no payment to any Employee
Benefit Plan or with respect to any such  obligation  or  arrangement  since the
Last NSC Balance Sheet Date has been disproportionately  large compared to prior
payments.  For purposes hereof,  "ACCRUED  LIABILITIES" shall include a pro rata
contribution  to  each  Employee  Benefit  Plan  or with  respect  to each  such
obligation or  arrangement  for that portion of a plan year or other  applicable
period which commences  prior to, and ends after,  the Closing Date, and Accrued
Liabilities for any portion of a

                                      -9-
<PAGE>


plan year or other  applicable  period shall be  determined by  multiplying  the
liability  for the entire such year or period by a fraction,  the  numerator  of
which is the number of days  preceding  the Closing  Date in such year or period
and the  denominator  of which is the number of days in such year or period,  as
the case may be.

                (iii)   There  has  been  no  violation  of  the  reporting  and
disclosure  requirements  imposed  either  under  ERISA or the Code for  which a
penalty has been or may be imposed with respect to any Employee  Benefit Plan of
NSC. There has been no breach of fiduciary duty or  responsibility  with respect
to any Employee  Benefit Plan of NSC. No Employee Benefit Plan of NSC or related
trust has any liability of any nature, accrued or contingent,  including without
limitation  liabilities for Taxes, other than for routine payments to be made in
due course to participants and  beneficiaries,  except as set forth in Section E
of the NSC DISCLOSURE  LETTER.  NSC does not have any formal plan or commitment,
whether or not legally binding,  to create any additional or modify any existing
Employee Benefit Plan or benefit obligation or arrangement  described in Section
2.01(h)(i)).  Each  Employee  Benefit  Plan of NSC which is a group  health plan
within the meaning of Section  5000(b)(1) of the Code is and has been maintained
in full  compliance  with the  applicable  requirements  of Section 4980B of the
Code. Other than the health care  continuation  requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code,  NSC does not have any obligation to provide  post-retirement  medical
benefits or life insurance coverage or any deferred compensation benefits to any
present  or  former  employees.  There  is no  litigation,  arbitration,  claim,
governmental or other proceeding (formal or informal), or investigation pending,
threatened,  or (to the best of  NSC's  knowledge)  in  prospect  (or any  basis
therefor  known to NSC) with  respect  to any  Employee  Benefit  Plan of NSC or
related trust or with respect to any  fiduciary,  administrator,  or sponsor (in
its capacity as such) of any Employee  Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan of
NSC or related trust and no such  obligation or  arrangement is in violation of,
or in default with respect to, any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, which
violation or default would have a material  adverse effect thereon or decree nor
is NSC, any Employee  Benefit Plan of NSC, or any related trust required to take
any  action  in order to avoid  any such  violation  or  default.  No event  has
occurred,  or is (to the best of NSC's knowledge)  threatened or about to occur,
which would constitute a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA.

                (iv)    Each Pension Plan  maintained  for the  employees of NSC
has been qualified, from its inception, under Section 401(a) of the Code and any
related  trust has been an exempt trust for such period under Section 501 of the
Code.  Each  Pension Plan has been  operated in  accordance  with its terms.  No
Pension Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA has an  accumulated or waived
funding   deficiency  within  the  meaning  of  Section  412  of  the  Code.  No
investigation or review by the Internal Revenue Service is currently  pending or
(to the knowledge of NSC) is contemplated in which the Internal  Revenue Service
has asserted or may assert that any Pension Plan is not qualified  under Section
401(a) of the Code or that any related  trust is not exempt under Section 501 of
the Code.  Neither  NSC,  nor any  organization  to which NSC is a successor  or
parent corporation, within the meaning of Section 4069(b) of ERISA, has divested
itself of any entity  maintaining  or with an  obligation  to  contribute to any
Pension Plan which had an "AMOUNT OF UNFUNDED  BENEFIT  LIABILITIES," as defined
in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, at the time of such divestiture.  No assessment
of any federal  taxes with respect to any Employee  Benefit Plan of NSC has been
made or (to the  knowledge of NSC) is  contemplated  against NSC, or any related
trust of any Pension Plan of NSC, and nothing has occurred which would result in
the assessment of

                                      -10-
<PAGE>


unrelated  business  taxable  income under the Code with respect to any Employee
Benefit  Plan of NSC.  Form 5500's have been  timely  filed with  respect to all
Pension  Plans of NSC.  No event has  occurred or (to the  knowledge  of NSC) is
threatened  or about to occur which would  constitute a reportable  event within
the meaning of Section 4043(b) of ERISA. No notice of termination has been filed
by the plan  administrator  pursuant  to Section  4041 of ERISA or issued by the
Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  pursuant to Section  4042 of ERISA with
respect to any Pension Plan of NSC.

                (v)     NSC  does  not  currently   contribute   to,  and  since
September 16, 1980 has not effectuated  either a complete or partial  withdrawal
from,  any  multiemployer  Pension  Plan within the meaning of Section  3(37) of
ERISA.

                (vi)    Section E of the NSC DISCLOSURE  LETTER  contains a true
and correct  statement of the names,  relationship  with NSC,  present  rates of
compensation  (whether  in the form of salary,  bonuses,  commissions,  or other
supplemental  compensation now or hereafter payable), and aggregate compensation
for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2003 of (A) each director,  officer,  or
other  employee of NSC whose  aggregate  compensation  for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003 exceeded US$25,000 or whose aggregate  compensation  presently
exceeds the rate of US$25,000  per annum and (B) all sales agents,  dealers,  or
distributors  of NSC. Since  [December 31, 2003, NSC has not changed the rate of
compensation of any of its directors,  officers,  employees, agents, dealers, or
distributors,  nor  has  any  Employee  Benefit  Plan  or  program  of NSC  been
instituted  or amended to increase  benefits  thereunder.  There is no contract,
agreement,  plan,  arrangement,  or  understanding  covering  any  person  that,
individually or collectively,  could give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible by NSC by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

                (vii)   NSC has not, since at least December 31, 2003,  extended
or  maintained  credit,  arranged  for the  extension  of credit,  or renewed an
extension  of credit,  in the form of a personal  loan to or for any director or
executive officer (or equivalent thereof) thereof.

        (i)     PATENTS,  TRADEMARKS,  ET  CETERA.  NSC  does  not  own or  have
pending, and is not licensed or otherwise permitted to use, any material patent,
patent application,  trademark, trademark application,  service mark, copyright,
copyright application,  franchise,  trade secret, computer program (in object or
source code or otherwise),  or other intangible property or asset (collectively,
"INTANGIBLES"),  other  than as  described  in  Section C of the NSC  DISCLOSURE
LETTER.  Each  Intangible  is  validly  issued  and is  currently  in force  and
uncontested  in all  jurisdictions  in which it is used or in which  such use is
contemplated. Section C of the NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER contains a true and correct
listing of: (i) all  Intangibles  which are owned  (either in whole or in part),
used by, or licensed to NSC or which otherwise  relate to the businesses of NSC,
and  a  description  of  each  such  Intangible   which  identifies  its  owner,
registrant, or applicant; (ii) all contracts,  agreements,  instruments, leases,
and licenses and  identification  of all parties thereto under which NSC owns or
uses any Intangible (whether or not under license from third parties),  together
with the  identification  of the owner,  registrant,  or  applicant of each such
Intangible; (iii) all contracts,  agreements,  instruments, leases, and licenses
and  identification  of all parties  thereto under which NSC grants the right to
use any  Intangible;  (iv) all validity,  infringement,  right-to-use,  or other
opinions of counsel  (whether  in-house or outside)  which concern the validity,
infringement, or enforceability of any Intangible owned or controlled by a party
other than NSC which relates to the

                                      -11-
<PAGE>


businesses,  properties,  or assets of NSC.  Except as specified in Section C of
the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER,  to the  knowledge  of NSC: (v) NSC is the sole and
exclusive  owner or licensee of, and (other than those  exclusively  licensed by
NSC to a third party) has the right to use, all Intangibles;  (vi) no Intangible
is subject to any order,  judgment,  decree,  contract,  agreement,  instrument,
lease,  or license  restricting  the scope of the use thereof;  (vii) during the
last five years, NSC has not been charged with, and has not charged others with,
unfair  competition,   infringement  of  any  Intangible,  or  wrongful  use  of
confidential information,  trade secrets, or secret processes; and (viii) NSC is
not using any patentable invention,  confidential information,  trade secret, or
secret process of others.  There is no right under any  Intangible  necessary to
the businesses of NSC as presently  conducted or as it contemplates  conducting,
except  such as are so  designated  in Section C of the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER.
Except as  described  in  Section C of the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER,  NSC has not
infringed,  is not  infringing,  and has not received  notice of infringement in
respect of the Intangibles or asserted  Intangibles of others,  nor has NSC been
advised  by  counsel  or  others  that  it is  infringing  or may  infringe  the
Intangibles  or asserted  Intangibles  of others if any  currently  contemplated
business  activity  is  effectuated.  To  the  knowledge  of  NSC,  there  is no
infringement  by  others of  Intangibles  of NSC.  As far as NSC can  reasonably
foresee,  there is no  Intangible  or  asserted  Intangible  of others  that may
materially  adversely  affect the financial  condition,  results of  operations,
businesses,  properties,  assets,  liabilities,  or future prospects of NSC. All
material contracts, agreements,  instruments, leases, and licenses pertaining to
Intangibles  to  which  NSC is a  party,  or to  which  any  of its  businesses,
properties,  or assets are subject,  are in compliance in all material  respects
with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, judgments, and decrees binding on NSC
or to which any of its businesses,  properties,  or assets are subject.  NSC did
not register any trademark,  tradename or service mark,  design, or name used by
NSC to identify its products,  businesses, or services.  Neither any stockholder
of NSC, any director,  officer, or employee of NSC, any relative or affiliate of
any stockholder of NSC, any such director,  officer, or employee,  nor any other
corporation  or enterprise in which any  stockholder  of NSC, any such director,
officer,  or employee,  or any such relative or affiliate had or now has a 5% or
greater equity or voting or other substantial interest, possesses any Intangible
which relates to the businesses of NSC.

        (j)     QUESTIONABLE PAYMENTS.  Neither NSC, nor any director,  officer,
agent,  employee,  or other person associated with, or acting on behalf of, NSC,
nor any stockholder of NSC has, directly or indirectly: used any corporate funds
for unlawful  contributions,  gifts,  entertainment,  or other unlawful expenses
relating to political activity; made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic
government officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties or
campaigns from corporate  funds;  violated any provision of the Foreign  Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended; or made any bribe, rebate, payoff,  influence
payment, kickback, or other unlawful payment.

        (k)     AUTHORITY. NSC has all requisite power and authority to execute,
deliver,  and perform  this  Agreement  and to effect the  Reincorporation.  All
necessary  corporate  proceedings  of NSC have been duly taken to authorize  the
execution,  delivery,  and performance of this Agreement and the effectuation of
the Reincorporation thereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized,  executed,
and delivered by NSC,  constitutes the legal,  valid, and binding  obligation of
NSC,  and is  enforceable  as to NSC in  accordance  with its  terms.  Except as
otherwise  set forth in this  Agreement,  no consent,  authorization,  approval,
order,  license,  certificate,  or permit of or from, or  declaration  or filing
with, any federal, state, local, or other governmental authority or any court or

                                      -12-
<PAGE>


other tribunal is required by NSC for the execution, delivery, or performance of
this Agreement or the effectuation of the  Reincorporation by NSC. No consent of
any party to any  material  contract,  agreement,  instrument,  lease,  license,
arrangement,  or understanding to which NSC is a party, or to which it or any of
its  businesses,  properties,  or  assets  are  subject,  is  required  for  the
execution,  delivery,  or performance  of this Agreement or the  Reincorporation
(except such consents  referred to in Section D of the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER);
and  the  execution,  delivery,  and  performance  of  this  Agreement  and  the
effectuation  of the  Reincorporation  will not (if the consents  referred to in
Section  D of the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER  are  obtained  prior to the  Closing)
violate, result in a breach of, conflict with, or (with or without the giving of
notice or the passage of time or both)  entitle any party to terminate or call a
default under, entitle any party to receive rights or privileges that such party
was not entitled to receive before this Agreement was executed  under, or create
any obligation on the part of NSC to which it was not subject immediately before
this  Agreement  was  executed  or  the  Reincorporation  was  effectuated,   as
applicable,   under,  any  term  of  any  such  material  contract,   agreement,
instrument, lease, license, arrangement, or understanding,  or violate or result
in a breach of any term of the  certificate of  incorporation  (or other charter
document) (as currently in effect or as in effect upon the  Reincorporation)  or
by-laws (as currently in effect or as in effect upon the Reincorporation)of NSC,
or (if the  provisions of this  Agreement are  satisfied)  violate,  result in a
breach of, or conflict  with any law,  rule,  regulation,  order,  judgment,  or
decree binding on NSC or to which any of its businesses,  properties,  or assets
are subject,  which violation or breach would have a material  adverse effect on
NSC. Neither NSC, nor any of its officers,  directors,  employees, or agents has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any fee, commission,
or other compensation  payable by any person on account of alleged employment as
a broker or finder, or alleged performance of services as a broker or finder, in
connection  with  or  as  a  result  of  this  Agreement  or  the   transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection herewith,  including,  without limitation,
the Reincorporation.

        (l)     STATUS OF SHARES OF NSC COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED.

                (i)     Assuming  without   investigation  that  the  shares  of
        Gridline  Capital  Stock  outstanding  on the  Closing  Date are validly
        authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable, the shares of
        NSC Common  Stock to be issued  pursuant to Section  1.02(a)  hereof are
        validly  authorized  and,  when the such shares of NSC Common Stock have
        been duly delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such shares
        of  NSC  Common  Stock  will  be  validly   issued,   fully  paid,   and
        nonassessable and will not have been issued,  owned or held in violation
        of any preemptive or similar right of stockholder.

                (ii)    The shares of NSC Common Stock to be issued  pursuant to
        the to terms of such Gridline  Stock  Options and Gridline  Warrants are
        validly  authorized  and, when such shares of NSC Common Stock have been
        duly  delivered  pursuant to, and in accordance  with,  the terms of the
        Gridline Stock Options and the Gridline  Warrants against payment of the
        exercise price specified  therein,  such shares of NSC Common Stock will
        be validly issued,  fully paid, and nonassessable and will not have been
        issued, owned or held in violation of any preemptive or similar right of
        stockholder.

        (m)     INSURANCE.  All  policies  of fire and other  insurance  against
casualty  and other  losses and public  liability  insurance  carried by NSC are
described in Section F of the NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER (including the risks covered
and limits of such policies) and are in full force and effect. All

                                      -13-
<PAGE>


premiums  in  respect  of such  policies  for which  premium  notices  have been
received have been paid in full as the same become due and payable.  NSC has not
failed to give any notice or present any claim under any insurance policy in due
and timely fashion.  There are no actual claims or claims  threatened in writing
against NSC which could come within the scope of such  coverage nor are any such
policies  currently  threatened  with  cancellation.  There  are no  outstanding
requirements or  recommendations  by any insurance  company that issued a policy
with respect to any of the respective assets,  the businesses,  or operations of
NSC or by any  Board of Fire  Underwriters  or  other  body  exercising  similar
functions or by any governmental authority requiring or recommending any repairs
or other  work to be done on, or with  respect  to,  any of the assets of NSC or
requiring or  recommending  any  equipment or  facilities to be installed on any
premises from which the businesses of NSC is conducted or in connection with any
of the  respective  assets  thereof.  NSC does not  have  any  knowledge  of any
material proposed increase in applicable insurance rates or of any conditions or
circumstances  applicable  to the  businesses  thereof that might result in such
increases.   No  such  policy  is  terminable  by  virtue  of  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        (o)     TRADING MATTERS. At the date hereof and at the Closing Date:

                (i)     the NSC Common Stock is eligible to be traded and quoted
in the over-the-counter market known as the "pink sheet market" (the "OTC");

                (ii)    NSC has and shall have performed or satisfied all of its
undertakings to, and of its obligations and requirements with, the SEC;

                (iv)    NSC has not,  and shall not have taken any  action  that

        (p)     REORGANIZATION.

                (i)     NSC has not taken and has not  agreed to take any action
(other than actions  contemplated by this  Agreement)  that could  reasonably be
expected  to  prevent  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  from
constituting a "reorganization"  under section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Code or as an
acquisition  of in excess of 80% of the stock of a  corporation  in exchange for
property under Section 351 of the Code. NSC is not aware of any agreement,  plan
or  other  circumstance  that  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  prevent  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from so qualifying.

                (ii)    NSC has no plan or intention to reacquire, and, to NSC's
knowledge,  no person related to NSC within the meaning of Treasury  Regulations
Section 1.368-1 has a plan or intention to acquire,  any of the NSC Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.02(a) hereof.

        (q)     COMPLETENESS OF DISCLOSURE. No representation or warranty by NSC
in this Agreement  contains or, and at the Closing Date will contain,  an untrue
statement of material fact or omits or, at the Closing Date,  will omit to state

        (r)     PERIODIC REPORTING.

                (i)     The NSC Common Stock has been  registered  under Section
12 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE  ACT") and

Exchange Act since at least April 18, 2000 as such  documents  have been amended
since the time of the  filing  thereof  (the "NSC SEC  DOCUMENTS").  The NSC SEC
Documents, including, without limitation, any financial statements and schedules
included therein, at the time filed or, if subsequently  amended, as so amended,
(i) did not  contain  any untrue  statement  of a material  fact  required to be
stated  therein  or  necessary  in  order  to make the  statements  therein  not
misleading and (ii) complied in all respects with the applicable requirements of
the  Exchange  Act and the  applicable  rules and  regulations  thereunder.  The
financial statements included in the NSC SEC Documents complied when filed as to
form in all material respects with applicable  accounting  requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect  thereto,  have been
prepared in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the
United States, applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited  financial
statements,  as permitted by the rules and  regulations of the  Commission)  and

dates thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows.

                (ii)    The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15  under the  Exchange  Act;  such  controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all material information  concerning the
Company and its  subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Company's  filings with the SEC and other
public  disclosure  documents.  NSC has  delivered  to  Gridline  copies of, all
written  descriptions  of,  and  all  policies,   manuals  and  other  documents
promulgating,  such disclosure controls and procedures. To NSC's knowledge, each
director and executive  officer thereof has filed with the SEC on a timely basis
all  statements  required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations  thereunder  since  April  18,  2000.  As used in the  this  Section
2.01(r),  the term "file"  shall be broadly  construed  to include any manner in
which a document  or  information  is  furnished,  supplied  or  otherwise  made
available to the SEC.

                (iii)   The Chief  Executive  Officer  and the  Chief  Financial
Officer of NSC have  signed,  and the  Company  has  furnished  to the SEC,  all
certifications  required by Sections  302 and 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of
2002; such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters
certified  therein and have not been modified or withdrawn;  and neither NSC nor
any of its officers has received notice from any governmental entity questioning
or  challenging  the  accuracy,  completeness,  form  or  manner  of  filing  or
submission of such certifications.

                (iv)    NSC has  heretofore has provided  Gridline  complete and
correct copies of all certifications filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and  hereby  reaffirms,  represents  and
warrants to Gridline the matters and statements made in such  certificates.

        (s)     COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

                (i)     NSC is in compliance  with,  and is not in violation of,
applicable  federal,  state,  local or foreign  statutes,  laws and  regulations
(including without  limitation,  any applicable  building,  zoning or other law,
ordinance  or  regulation)  affecting  its  properties  or the  operation of its
business. NSC is not subject to any order, decree, judgment or other sanction of
any court, administrative agency or other tribunal.

                (ii)    Each of NSC,  its  directors  and its  senior  financial
officers has consulted  with NSC's  independent  auditors and with NSC's outside
counsel  with respect to, and (to the extent  applicable  to NSC) is familiar in
all material  respects with all of the  requirements of,  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of
2002.  NSC is in compliance  with the provisions of such act applicable to it as
of the date hereof and has  implemented  such programs and has taken  reasonable
steps,  upon the  advice of NSC's  independent  auditors  and  outside  counsel,
respectively,  to ensure  NSC's future  compliance  (not later than the relevant
statutory and regulatory  deadlines  therefore)  with all provisions of such act
which shall become applicable thereto after the date hereof.

        (t)     LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  AND  HISTORY.  NSC hereby  represents  that,
unless otherwise  disclosed herein or in Section G of the NSC DISCLOSURE LETTER,
no officer, director or affiliate of NSC, has been, within the five years ending
on the Closing Date, a party to any bankruptcy  petition  against such person or
against  any  business  of which such  person  was  affiliated;  convicted  in a
criminal  proceeding  or subject  to a pending  criminal  proceeding  (excluding
traffic violations and other minor offenses);  subject to any order, judgment or
decree,  not  subsequently  reversed,  suspended  or  vacated,  of any  court of
competent   jurisdiction,   permanently  or  temporarily   enjoining,   barring,
suspending  or otherwise  limiting  their  involvement  in any type of business,
securities or banking activities;  or found by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a civil action,  by the SEC or the Commodity  Futures  Trading  Commission to
have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment
has not been reversed, suspended or vacated.

        SECTION 2.02    REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES  OF GRIDLINE.  Gridline
hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, NSC:

        (a)     ORGANIZATION AND  QUALIFICATION.  Gridline owns no subsidiary or
affiliate  corporation or owns any interest in any other enterprise  (whether or
not such enterprise is a corporation).  Section A of the letter, dated even date
herewith,  from Gridline to NSC (the "GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE  LETTER"),  correctly
sets  forth as to  Gridline  its  place  of  incorporation,  principal  place of
business,  jurisdictions  in  which  it is  qualified  to do  business,  and the
businesses  which it presently  conducts and which it  contemplates  conducting.
Gridline is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, with all requisite power and authority,
and  all  necessary  consents,  authorizations,   approvals,  orders,  licenses,
certificates,  and permits of and from, and  declarations  and filings with, all
federal,  state,  local, and other  governmental  authorities and all courts and
other tribunals,  to own, lease,  license, and use its properties and assets and
to carry on the  businesses  in which it is now  engaged and the  businesses  in
which it  contemplates  engaging.  Gridline is duly  qualified  to transact  the
businesses  in which it is engaged.  Gridline  is in good  standing as a foreign
corporation in every jurisdiction in which its ownership, leasing, licensing, or
use  of  property  or  assets  or  the  conduct  of its  businesses  makes  such
qualification necessary.

                                      -16-
<PAGE>


         (b)  CAPITALIZATION.  The authorized capital stock of Gridline consists
of 250,000,000 shares of capital stock, divided into 20,000,000 shares of "blank
check"  preferred  stock,  par value  $0.0001 per share,  no shares of which are
outstanding, and 230,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share
, of which 96,700,000 shares are issued and outstanding. Each of the outstanding
shares of Gridline Capital Stock is validly  authorized,  validly issued,  fully
paid,  and  nonassessable,  has not  been  issued  and is not  owned  or held in
violation of any preemptive right of  stockholders,  and is owned by the persons
or entities set forth in Section A of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE  LETTER,  in each
case  free  and  clear  of all  liens,  security  interests,  pledges,  charges,
encumbrances,  stockholders'  agreements,  and voting  trusts.  Except for those
certain  options,  warrants and convertible  securities  described on SCHEDULE B
hereto, there is no outstanding security or other instrument convertible into or
exercisable  or  exchangeable  for  Gridline  Capital  Stock,  and  there  is no
commitment,  plan, or arrangement to issue, and no outstanding option,  warrant,
or other right calling for the issuance of, any share of Gridline  Capital Stock
or any  security  or other  instrument  convertible  into,  exercisable  for, or
exchangeable for Gridline Capital Stock.

        (c)     FINANCIAL  CONDITION.  Gridline  has  delivered  to NSC true and
correct  copies of the  following:  audited  balance  sheets of  Gridline  as of
September  30,  2004;  and  audited  statements  of  operations,  statements  of
stockholders'  equity,  and  statements of cash flows of Gridline for the period
from the date of  inception  through  September  30, 2004.  Such  balance  sheet
presents fairly the financial condition,  assets, liabilities, and stockholders'
equity of Gridline as of its date; such statement of operations and statement of
stockholders'  equity  presents fairly the results of operations of Gridline for
the period  indicated;  and such  statement  of cash flows  presents  fairly the
information  purported to be shown therein. The financial statements referred to
in this Section 2.02(c) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles in the United States consistently  applied throughout the
periods  involved and are in accordance  with the books and records of Gridline.
The  financial  statements  referred  to in this  Section  2.02(c)  contain  all
certifications and statements  required,  if any, by the SEC's Order, dated June
27, 2002,  pursuant to Section  21(a)(1) of the  Exchange Act (File No.  4-460),
Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act, or 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section
906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002) with  respect  to the  report  relating
thereto. Since September 30, 2004:

                (i)     There has at no time been a material  adverse  change in
        the financial condition,  results of operations,  business,  properties,
        assets, liabilities, or future prospects of Gridline.

                (ii)    Gridline has not authorized, declared, paid, or effected
        any  dividend or  liquidating  or other  distribution  in respect of its
        capital stock or any direct or indirect redemption,  purchase,  or other
        acquisition of any stock of Gridline.

                (iii)   The  operations  and  businesses  of Gridline  have been
        conducted in all respects  only in the ordinary  course,  except for the
        transactions contemplated hereby and in connection herewith.

                (iv)    There has been no accepted  purchase order or quotation,
        arrangement,  or  understanding  for  future  sale  of the  products  or
        services of Gridline that Gridline expects will not be profitable.

                                      -17-
<PAGE>


                (v)     Gridline has not suffered an extraordinary loss (whether
        or not covered by insurance) or waived any right of substantial value.

There is no fact known to Gridline which materially  adversely affects or in the
future (as far as Gridline  can  reasonably  foresee) may  materially  adversely
affect the financial  condition,  results of operations,  business,  properties,
assets,  liabilities,  or future prospects of Gridline;  provided, however, that
Gridline  expresses no opinion as to  political  or economic  matters of general
applicability.  Gridline  has made  known,  or caused to be made  known,  to the
accountants   or  auditors  who  have   prepared,   reviewed,   or  audited  the
aforementioned   consolidated   financial  statements  all  material  facts  and
circumstances  which could  affect the  preparation,  presentation,  accuracy or
completeness  thereof.  The  statement  of  operations  of Gridline for the year
ending December 31, 2004 shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles in the United States consistently  applied throughout the
periods involved,  and shall contain all certifications and statements required,
if any, by the SEC's Order, dated June 27, 2002, pursuant to Section 21(a)(1) of
the Exchange Act (File No. 4-460), Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act,
or 18 U.S.C.  Section 1350  (Sections 302 and 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of
2002) with respect to the report relating thereto.

        (d)     TAX AND OTHER  LIABILITIES.  Gridline does not have any material
liability of any nature, accrued or contingent,  including,  without limitation,
liabilities for Taxes, and liabilities to customers or suppliers, other than the
following:

                (i)     Liabilities  for which full  provision  has been made on
        the balance  sheet and the notes  thereto  (the "LAST  GRIDLINE  BALANCE
        SHEET") as of  September  30,  2004 (the "LAST  GRIDLINE  BALANCE  SHEET
        DATE") referred to in Section 2.02(c); and

                (ii)    Other  liabilities   arising  since  the  Last  Gridline
        Balance Sheet Date and prior to the Closing Date in the ordinary  course
        of business (which shall not include liabilities to customers on account
        of  defective   products  or  services)  or  in   connection   with  the
        transactions contemplated hereby or in connection herewith which are not
        inconsistent with the  representations and warranties of Gridline or any
        other provision of this Agreement.

Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  the  amounts  set up as
provisions  for Taxes on the Last Gridline  Balance Sheet are sufficient for all
accrued and unpaid Taxes of Gridline, whether or not due and payable and whether
or not disputed, under tax laws, as in effect on the Last Gridline Balance Sheet
Date or now in  effect,  for the  period  ended on such date and for all  fiscal
periods  prior  thereto.  The  execution,  delivery,  and  performance  of  this
Agreement by Gridline  will not cause any Taxes to be payable  other than by the
stockholders of Gridline or cause any lien, charge, or encumbrance to secure any
Taxes to be created either immediately or upon the nonpayment of any Taxes other
than on the properties or assets of the  stockholders of Gridline.  Gridline has
not been  required to file any tax returns by any  overseas tax  authorities  or
required to pay any taxes,  assessments,  and other governmental charges payable
or  remittable by it or levied upon it or its  properties,  assets,  income,  or
franchises which are due and payable. Gridline is not subject to any litigation,
governmental or other proceeding (formal or informal), or investigation pending,
threatened, or in prospect with respect to any such report or the subject matter
of such report.

                                      -18-
<PAGE>


        (e)     LITIGATION AND CLAIMS. Except as described in Section H GRIDLINE
DISCLOSURE LETTER, there is no litigation,  arbitration,  claim, governmental or
other proceeding (formal or informal), or investigation pending, threatened, or,
to the best of Gridline's knowledge, in prospect (or any basis therefor known to
Gridline),  with respect to Gridline or any of its  businesses,  properties,  or
assets.  Gridline is not affected by any present or  threatened  strike or other
labor  disturbance  nor to the knowledge of Gridline is any union  attempting to
represent any employee of Gridline as collective  bargaining agent.  Gridline is
not in violation of, or in default with respect to, any law,  rule,  regulation,
order,  judgment,  or decree which  violation  or default  would have a material
adverse  effect upon  Gridline;  nor is Gridline  required to take any action in
order to avoid such violation or default.

        (f)     PROPERTIES.

                (i)     Gridline does not own any legal or equitable interest in
any real  property.  Gridline has good title to all other  properties and assets
material to Gridline, used in its business or owned by it (except real and other
properties  and assets as are held  pursuant to leases or licenses  described in
Section B or C of the GRIDLINE DISCLOSURE LETTER),  free and clear of all liens,
mortgages,  security interests,  pledges, charges, and encumbrances (except such
as are listed in Section D of the GRIDLINE DISCLOSURE LETTER).

                (ii)    All accounts and notes receivable  reflected on the Last
Gridline  Balance Sheet, or arising since the Last Gridline  Balance Sheet Date,
have been collected,  or are and will be good and  collectible,  in each case at
the aggregate  recorded  amounts  thereof  without  right of recourse,  defense,
deduction, return of goods, counterclaim,  offset, or set off on the part of the
obligor, and, if not collected,  can reasonably be anticipated to be paid within
180 days of the date incurred.

                (iii)   All  production  in progress  of Gridline is usable,  in
current  production  and  marketable,  on a normal  basis in the  existing  film
production business of Gridline.

                (iv)    Attached as Section B of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE LETTER
is a true and complete list of the classes of all tangible properties and assets
owned by Gridline  or leased or  licensed  by Gridline  from or to a third party
(including  inventory  but not  including  Intangibles,  as  defined  in Section
2.02(i)),  and with respect to such  properties and assets leased or licensed by
Gridline from or to a third party, a description  of such lease or license.  All
such  properties  and  assets  (including  Intangibles)  owned by  Gridline  are
reflected on the Last Gridline Balance Sheet (except for acquisitions subsequent
to the Last Gridline  Balance Sheet Date and prior to the Closing Date which are
either noted in Section B or C of the GRIDLINE DISCLOSURE LETTER or are approved
in writing by NSC). All real and other  tangible  properties and assets owned by
Gridline or leased or licensed by Gridline  from or to a third party are in good
and usable  condition  (reasonable  wear and tear which is not such as to affect
adversely the operation of the business of Gridline excepted).

                (v)     To the best of  Gridline's  knowledge,  no real property
owned by Gridline  or leased or  licensed  by Gridline  from or to a third party
lies in an area which is, or will be,  subject to zoning,  use, or building code
restrictions which would prohibit,  and, to the best of Gridline's knowledge, no
state of facts  relating to the actions or inaction of another  person or entity
or his or its ownership,  leasing, or licensing of any real or personal property
exists or will exist which would

                                      -19-
<PAGE>


prevent, the continued effective  ownership,  leasing, or licensing of such real
property in the businesses in which Gridline is now engaged or the businesses in
which it contemplates engaging.

                (vi)    The properties and assets (including  Intangibles) owned
by Gridline  (other than those  leased or licensed by Gridline to a third party)
or leased  or  licensed  by  Gridline  from a third  party  constitute  all such
properties  and assets  which are  necessary  to the  business  of  Gridline  as
presently conducted or as it contemplates conducting.

                (vii)   Gridline  has not  caused or  permitted  its  businesses
properties,  or assets to be used to generate,  manufacture,  refine, transport,
treat, store,  handle,  dispose of, transfer,  produce, or process any Hazardous
Substance (as such term is defined in Section  2.01(f)(v))  except in compliance
with all applicable laws, rules,  regulations,  orders,  judgments, and decrees,
and has not caused or permitted  the Release (as such term is defined in Section
2.01(f)(v))  of any  Hazardous  Substance  on or off the site of any property of
Gridline.

        (g)     CONTRACTS  AND  OTHER  INSTRUMENTS.  Section  D of the  GRIDLINE
DISCLOSURE  LETTER  contains a true and  correct  statement  of the  information
required to be  contained  therein  regarding  material  contracts,  agreements,
instruments,  leases, licenses,  arrangements, or understandings with respect to
Gridline.  Gridline has furnished to NSC: (i) the  certificate of  incorporation
and by-laws of Gridline (or, in each case, the comparable charter documents,  if
any, under applicable law) and all amendments  thereto,  as presently in effect,

following:  (A) true and correct copies of all material  contracts,  agreements,

DISCLOSURE LETTER.  Except as set forth in Section D of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE
LETTER,  Gridline is not party to any  employment  agreement  with any  employee
thereof.  To the best of  Gridline's  knowledge,  none of  Gridline or any other
party to any such contract,  agreement,  instrument, lease, or license is now or
expects  in the  future to be in  violation  or breach  of, or in  default  with
respect to complying  with, any term thereof,  and each such material  contract,
agreement, instrument, lease, or license is in full force and is (to the best of
Gridline's knowledge in the case of third parties) the legal, valid, and binding
obligation  of the  parties  thereto  and  (subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  and other laws affecting the  enforceability  of creditors'  rights
generally) is  enforceable  as to them in accordance  with its terms.  Each such
material  supply,  distribution,  agency,  financing,  or other  arrangement  or
understanding is a valid and continuing  arrangement or  understanding;  none of
Gridline or any other party to any such arrangement or  understanding  has given
notice of termination or taken any action  inconsistent  with the continuance of
such arrangement or understanding;  and the execution, delivery, and performance
of this Agreement will not prejudice any such  arrangement or  understanding  in
any way.  Gridline enjoys peaceful and undisturbed  possession  under all leases
and licenses  under which it is operating.  Gridline is not party to or bound by
any  contract,   agreement,   instrument,   lease,  license,   arrangement,   or
understanding, or subject to any charter or other restriction, which has had or,
to the best of Gridline's  knowledge,  may in the future have a material adverse
effect  on  the  financial   condition,   results  of  operations,   businesses,
properties,  assets, liabilities, or future prospects of Gridline and, following
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby, NSC. Gridline has not

the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 will exceed US$25,000 or whose aggregate
rate of compensation  presently  exceeds the rate of US$25,000 per annum and (B)
all sales agents,  dealers,  or  distributors  of Gridline.  Since September 30,
2004, Gridline has not changed the rate of compensation of any of its directors,
officers,  employees,  agents,  dealers,  or distributors,  nor has any Employee
Benefit  Plan or program of  Gridline  been  instituted  or amended to  increase
benefits thereunder.

        (i)     PATENTS,  TRADEMARKS,  ET CETERA.  Gridline does not own or have
pending,  and is not  licensed  or  otherwise  permitted  to use,  any  material
Intangible,  other than as  described  in Section C of the  GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE
LETTER.  Each  Intangible  is  validly  issued  and is  currently  in force  and
uncontested  in all  jurisdictions  in which it is used or in which  such use is
contemplated.  Section C of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE  LETTER contains a true and
correct listing of: (i) all Intangibles which

                                      -21-
<PAGE>


are owned  (either in whole or in part),  used by, or  licensed  to  Gridline or
which otherwise relate to the businesses of Gridline,  and a description of each
such Intangible which identifies its owner, registrant,  or applicant;  (ii) all
contracts,  agreements,  instruments, leases, and licenses and identification of
all parties thereto under which Gridline owns or uses any Intangible (whether or
not under license from third parties),  together with the  identification of the
owner,  registrant,  or applicant of each such Intangible;  (iii) all contracts,
agreements,  instruments, leases, and licenses and identification of all parties
thereto under which Gridline  grants the right to use any  Intangible;  and (iv)
all validity, infringement,  right-to-use, or other opinions of counsel (whether
in-house or outside) which concern the validity, infringement, or enforceability
of any  Intangible  owned or  controlled  by a party other than  Gridline  which
relates  to the  businesses,  properties,  or  assets  of  Gridline.  Except  as
specified in Section C of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE  LETTER:  (v) Gridline is the
sole and  exclusive  owner or  licensee  of, and (other  than those  licensed by
Gridline  to a third  party)  has the  right to use,  all  Intangibles;  (vi) no
Intangible  is subject  to any order,  judgment,  decree,  contract,  agreement,
instrument,  lease, or license  restricting the scope of the use thereof;  (vii)
during the last five years,  Gridline  has not been  charged  with,  and has not
charged others with,  unfair  competition,  infringement of any  Intangible,  or
wrongful use of confidential  information,  trade secrets,  or secret processes;
and  (viii)  Gridline  is  not  using  any  patentable  invention,  confidential
information,  trade secret, or secret process of others. There is no right under
any Intangible necessary to the businesses of Gridline as presently conducted or
as it contemplates conducting,  except such as are so designated in Section C of
the GRIDLINE DISCLOSURE LETTER.  Gridline has not infringed,  is not infringing,
and has not received  notice of  infringement  in respect of the  Intangibles or
asserted  Intangibles  of others,  nor has  Gridline  been advised by counsel or
others  that it is  infringing  or may  infringe  the  Intangibles  or  asserted
Intangibles  of  others  if any  currently  contemplated  business  activity  is
effectuated. To the knowledge of Gridline, there is no infringement by others of
Intangibles of Gridline. As far as Gridline can foresee,  there is no Intangible
or  asserted  Intangible  of others  that may  materially  adversely  affect the
financial  condition,  results of operations,  businesses,  properties,  assets,
liabilities,  or  future  prospects  of  Gridline.  All  contracts,  agreements,
instruments, leases, and licenses pertaining to Intangibles to which Gridline is
a party, or to which any of its businesses,  properties,  or assets are subject,
are in compliance with all laws,  rules,  regulations,  orders,  judgments,  and
decrees  binding on Gridline or to which any of its businesses,  properties,  or
assets are  subject.  There is no  trademark,  tradename or service mark used by
Gridline to  identify,  respectively,  its  products,  businesses,  or services.
Neither  the  Gridline  Shareholders,  any  director,  officer,  or  employee of
Gridline,  any relative or affiliate  of the Gridline  Shareholders  or any such
director, officer, or employee, nor any other corporation or enterprise in which
the Gridline Shareholders,  any such director, officer, or employee, or any such
relative or affiliate  had or now has a 5% or greater  equity or voting or other
substantial  interest,  possesses any Intangible which relates to the businesses
of Gridline.

        (j)     QUESTIONABLE  PAYMENTS.  Neither  Gridline,  nor  any  director,
officer,  agent,  employee, or other person associated with, or acting on behalf
of, Gridline, nor the Gridline Shareholders,  has, directly or indirectly:  used
any corporate funds for unlawful contributions,  gifts, entertainment,  or other
unlawful expenses relating to political  activity;  made any unlawful payment to
foreign or domestic government  officials or employees or to foreign or domestic
political  parties or campaigns from corporate funds;  violated any provision of
the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act of 1977,  as  amended;  or made any bribe,
rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback, or other unlawful payment.

execute,   deliver,   and  perform  this  Agreement.   All  necessary  corporate

delivery, and performance of this Agreement by Gridline. This Agreement has been
duly  authorized,  executed,  and delivered by Gridline,  constitutes the legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Gridline,  and is enforceable as to Gridline in

license, arrangement, or understanding to which Gridline is a party, or to which
its or any of its businesses, properties, or assets are subject, is required for
the execution,  delivery, or performance of this Agreement (except such consents
referred to in Section D of the GRIDLINE DISCLOSURE LETTER);  and the execution,
delivery,  and performance of this Agreement will not (if the consents  referred
to in Section D of the  GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE  LETTER are  obtained  prior to the
Closing) violate,  result in a breach of, conflict with, or (with or without the
giving of notice or the passage of time or both)  entitle any party to terminate
or call a default under,  entitle any party to receive rights or privileges that
such party was not entitled to receive  immediately  before this  Agreement  was
executed under, or create any obligation on the part of Gridline or NSC to which
it was not subject  immediately  before this Agreement was executed  under,  any
term of any such  material  contract,  agreement,  instrument,  lease,  license,
arrangement,  or understanding,  or violate or result in a breach of any term of
the  certificate  of  incorporation  or by-laws of Gridline  (or the  comparable
charter documents,  if any, under applicable law), or (if the provisions of this
Agreement are  satisfied)  violate,  result in a breach of, or conflict with any
law,  rule,  regulation,  order,  judgment,  or decree binding on Gridline or to
which any of its businesses,  properties,  or assets are subject.  Except as set
forth in Section F of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE LETTER,  neither Gridline nor any
of its  officers,  directors,  employees,  or agents has  employed any broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any fee, commission,  or other compensation
payable by any person on account of alleged employment as a broker or finder, or
alleged  performance of services as a broker or finder, in connection with or as
a result of this Agreement or the other transactions  contemplated hereby and in
connection herewith.

        (l)     INSURANCE.  All  policies  of fire and other  insurance  against
casualty and other losses and public liability insurance carried by Gridline are
described in Section H of the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE  LETTER  (including the risks
covered and limits of such  policies)  and are in full force and effect.  A full
and complete  copy of each such  insurance  policy has been provided to NSC, and
such policies are summarized in Section G of the GRIDLINE DISCLOSURE LETTER. All
premiums  in  respect  of such  policies  for which  premium  notices  have been
received  have been paid in full as the same  become due and  payable.  Gridline
have not  failed to give any  notice or present  any claim  under any  insurance
policy  in due  and  timely  fashion.  There  are no  actual  claims  or  claims
threatened in writing against Gridline which could come within the scope of such
coverage nor are any such policies currently threatened with cancellation. There
are no outstanding requirements or recommendations by any insurance company that
issued a policy with respect to any of the respective assets, the businesses, or
operations  of  Gridline  or by any  Board of Fire  Underwriters  or other  body
exercising  similar  functions  or by any  governmental  authority  requiring or
recommending any repairs or other work to be done on, or with respect to, any of
the respective  assets of Gridline or requiring or recommending any equipment or
facilities to be installed on any

                                      -23-
<PAGE>


premises  from which the  respective  businesses  of Gridline is conducted or in
connection with any of the respective assets thereof. Gridline does not have any
knowledge of any material proposed increase in applicable  insurance rates or of
any conditions or circumstances  applicable to the respective businesses thereof
that might result in such  increases.  No such policy is terminable by virtue of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (m)     BUSINESS  CONDUCTED  IN NO  OTHER  NAME.  Subject  to  the  next
sentence,  all  business of  Gridline  has been  conducted  in its and for their
benefit and there are no parties  related or affiliated  with  Gridline,  either
directly or  indirectly,  which are  competing  for the  business  of  Gridline.
Gridline  conducts  business in the  following  name:  "Gridline  Communications
Corp." and, previously, under the name "Halocom, Inc."

        (n)     CUSTOMERS  AND  SUPPLIERS.  There  has  been no  termination  or
cancellation of any relationship between Gridline and any material supplier,  or
any  customer or group of customers  which,  individually  or in the  aggregate,
represented  more than five (5%) percent of the gross revenues of Gridline taken
as a whole during the period from July 1, 2004 (inception) through September 30,
20034,  nor is there  any  reason  to  believe  that any  such  terminations  or
cancellations of such magnitudes are pending or threatened.

        (o)     COMPLETENESS  OF DISCLOSURE.  No  representation  or warranty by
Gridline in this  Agreement  contains,  or at the Closing Date will contain,  an
untrue  statement of material  fact or omits or at the Closing Date will omit to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements made not misleading.

local or foreign statutes,  laws and regulations  (including without limitation,

                                   ARTICLE III

COVENANTS

        SECTION 3.01    COVENANTS OF NSC. NSC covenants  and agrees that,  after
the date  hereof  and  through  the  earlier  of the  Closing or the date of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IV hereof (the earlier of such
times, the "RELEASE TIME"),  unless Gridline will otherwise  approve in writing,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld:

        (a)     Until the release time, except as otherwise  provided herein, no
amendment shall be made in the certificate of  incorporation  or by-laws (or, in
each case, the comparable  charter  documents,  if any, under applicable law, of
NSC).

        (b)     Until the Release Time, no share of capital stock of NSC, option
or warrant for any such share, right to subscribe to or purchase any such share,
or security  convertible  into, or  exchangeable  or  exercisable  for, any such
share,  shall be issued or sold by NSC, otherwise than as contemplated by, or in
connection with, this Agreement.

        (c)     Until the Release  Time,  no dividend  or  liquidating  or other
distribution or stock split shall be authorized,  declared, paid, or effected by
NSC in respect of the outstanding  shares of Gridline  Capital Stock.  Until the
Release Time, no direct or indirect redemption,  purchase,  or other acquisition
shall be made by NSC of shares of NSC Capital Stock.

        (d)     Until the Release  Time,  except in the  ordinary  course of its
business,  NSC shall not borrow money,  guarantee the borrowing of money, engage
in any  transaction,  or enter into any agreement  other than in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection herewith.

        (e)     Until the Release Time, NSC will afford the officers, directors,
employees,   counsel,  agents,  investment  bankers,   accountants,   and  other
representatives  of Gridline and the Gridline  Shareholders free and full access
to the plants,  properties,  books,  and records of NSC. NSC will permit them to
make extracts  from and copies of such books and records,  and will from time to
time  furnish  Gridline  and the  Gridline  Shareholders  with  such  additional
financial  and  operating  data  and  other  information  as  to  the  financial
condition, results of operations,  businesses,  properties, assets, liabilities,
or future prospects of NSC as Gridline or the Gridline Shareholders from time to
time may  request.  Until the  Release  Time,  NSC will  cause  the  independent
certified  public  accountants  of  NSC  to  make  available  to  Gridline,  its
independent  certified public accountants,  and the Gridline  Shareholders,  the
work papers relating to the audits of NSC referred to in Section 2.01(c) of this
Agreement.

        (f)     Until the Release Time, NSC will conduct its affairs, so that on
the Closing Date, no  representation  or warranty of NSC will be inaccurate,  no
covenant  or  agreement  of NSC  will  be  breached,  and no  condition  in this
Agreement will remain  unfulfilled by reason of the actions or omissions of NSC.
Except as otherwise consented to by Gridline in writing, until the Release Time,
NSC will conduct its affairs in all respects only in the ordinary course.

        (g)     Until the Release Time, NSC will immediately  advise Gridline in
a detailed  written  notice of any material fact or occurrence or any pending or
threatened material occurrence of which

                                      -26-
<PAGE>


it  obtains  knowledge  and  which  (if  existing  and  known at the date of the
execution  of this  Agreement)  would  have  been  required  to be set  forth or
disclosed  in or pursuant to this  Agreement  or in the NSC  DISCLOSURE  LETTER,
which (if existing and known at any time prior to or at the Closing)  would make
the  performance  by  any  party  of a  covenant  contained  in  this  Agreement
impossible  or make  such  performance  materially  more  difficult  than in the
absence of such fact or occurrence,  or which (if existing and known at the time
of the Closing)  would cause a condition to any party's  obligations  under this
Agreement not to be fully satisfied.

        (h)     NSC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to insure that
all  confidential  information  which  NSC or any  of its  officers,  directors,
employees,  counsel, agents,  investment bankers, or accountants may now possess
or may hereafter create or obtain relating to the financial  condition,  results
of operations,  businesses, properties, assets, liabilities, or future prospects
of Gridline,  any affiliate of Gridline, or any customer or supplier of Gridline
or any such affiliate shall not be published,  disclosed,  or made accessible by
any of them to any other person or entity  without the prior written  consent of
Gridline,  which written consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld;  provided,
however,  that the  restrictions  of this  sentence  shall  not apply (i) as may
otherwise  be  required  by law,  (ii) as may be  necessary  or  appropriate  in
connection with the  enforcement of this  Agreement,  or (iii) to the extent the
information shall have otherwise become publicly available. NSC shall, and shall
cause all other such persons and  entities to,  deliver to Gridline all tangible
evidence of the confidential  information relating to Gridline, any affiliate of
Gridline,  or (insofar as such  confidential  information was provided by, or on
behalf of, Gridline, or any such affiliate of Gridline) any customer or supplier
of any of them or any such affiliate to which the  restrictions of the foregoing
sentence apply immediately  after the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to
Article IV or V hereof.

        (i)     Before NSC releases any information concerning this Agreement or
any of the other  transactions  contemplated  hereby or in  connection  herewith
which is intended for or may result in public  dissemination  thereof, NSC shall
cooperate with Gridline,  shall furnish drafts of all documents or proposed oral
statements to Gridline for comment,  and shall not release any such  information
without the written consent of Gridline.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent
NSC from releasing any information if required to do so by law.

        (j)     NSC shall not make any agreement or reach any  understanding not
approved  in writing by  Gridline  as a condition  for  obtaining  any  consent,
authorization, approval, order, license, certificate, or permit required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (k)     NSC shall  promptly  prepare all required or, in the  reasonable
opinion of the parties  hereto,  appropriate  Periodic  Reports (as  hereinafter
defined)  and  other  regulatory  filings  relating  to this  Agreement  and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby and in  connection  herewith,  as well as all
Periodic  Reports which NSC is required to file,  but has not  heretofore  filed
(such deliquent Periodic Reports,  "DELIQUENT PERIODIC REPORTS"). NSC shall file
with the SEC all Deliquent  Periodic  Reports  within 15 days following the date
hereof.  NSC  shall  furnish  or cause to be  furnished,  for  inclusion  in the
Periodic Reports,  such information about NSC, and NSC's security holders as may
be required or as may be reasonably requested by Gridline, and shall continue to
furnish or cause to be furnished  such  information as is necessary to keep such
information correct and complete in all material respect until the Release Time.
NSC represents and warrants that the

                                      -27-
<PAGE>


information that it has furnished to date,  taken as a whole,  does not now, and
will not at any time prior to the Release Time, (i) contain an untrue  statement
of a material  fact or (ii) omit to state a material  fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading. NSC
represents and warrants that all information  heretofore  filed thereby with the
SEC does not now,  and will not at any time prior to the Release  Time,  and the
Deliquent  Periodic  Reports  will not,  when filed with the SEC and at any time
prior to the Release Time,  (iii) contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or (iv) omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the  statements  therein  not false or  misleading.  NSC shall  take any
action  required  to be taken  by it  under  state  "blue-sky,"  securities,  or
take-over  laws in connection  with the issuance of NSC Common Stock pursuant to
the transactions  contemplated  hereby and in connection  herewith.  The filings
made by NSC  within  the past six years  with the SEC were,  if filed  under the
Exchange Act, prepared in accordance with the then existing  requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations  thereunder  and, if filed under the
Securities Act,  prepared in accordance  with the then existing  requirements of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations  thereunder.  Such filings when
filed,  and the  press  releases  and  other  public  statements  NSC  has  made
subsequent to the last such filing when  considered  together with such filings,
did not at the time of filing or issuance of the press  releases or other public
statements,  as the case may be,  and (with  respect to the press  releases  and
other public statements,  when considered together with such filings) do not now
(i)  contain  an untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or (ii) omit to state a
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading.

        (l)     Prior   to   the   Release   Time,    shall   not   affect   any
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, or stock dividend of the NSC
Common Stock or any other security of NSC, otherwise than as contemplated by, or
in connection with, this Agreement.

                (a)     NSC shall  timely  prepare and file any  declaration  or
filing  necessary to comply with any transfer tax statutes that require any such
filing before the Closing.

                (b)     Until the  Release  Time,  NSC shall not,  and shall not
authorize or permit any officer, director,  employee, counsel, agent, investment
banker,  accountant,  or other representative of NSC, directly or indirectly, to
contemplate  or enter  into  any  transaction  the  effect  of  which  may be to
prohibit,  restrict, or delay the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement or impair the contemplated benefits to Gridline's stockholders
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


                (c)     (i)     Following the  consummation of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby and in  connection  herewith,  NSC will cause  Gridline  to
continue its historic  business or to use a  significant  portion of  Gridline's
historic  business  assets in a  business,  in each case  within the  meaning of
section 1.368-1(d) of the Treasury Regulations, assuming that the assets of, and
the business  conducted by, Gridline at the Closing Date  constitute  Gridline's
historic business assets and historic business, respectively.

                        (ii)    Following the  consummation of the  transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection herewith,  NSC will not permit Gridline to
issue  additional  shares  that would  result in NSC losing  control of Gridline
within the meaning of section 368(c) of the Code.

                                      -28-

        (d)     If required,  NSC shall use COMMERCIALLY  REASONABLE  efforts to
file  with  the  National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers,  Inc.,  or  its
affiliates, all information required by Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act.

        (n)     NSC shall effect the Reincorporation prior to the Closing.

        (o)     Effective  immediately following the Closing, each member of the

        (e)     Until the  Release  Time,  Gridline  will  afford the  officers,
directors,  employees,  counsel, agents,  investment bankers,  accountants,  and
other representatives of NSC and lenders, investors, and prospective lenders and
investors free and full access to the plants, properties,  books, and records of
Gridline,  will permit them to make  extracts  from and copies of such books and
records,  and will from time to time furnish NSC with such additional  financial
and operating data and other information as to the financial condition,  results
of operations,  businesses, properties, assets, liabilities, or future prospects
of  Gridline  as NSC from  time to time may  request.  Until the  Release  Time,
Gridline will cause the independent  certified public accountants of Gridline to
make available to NSC and its independent  certified public accountants the work
papers relating to the audits of Gridline referred to in Section 2.02(c) of this
Agreement.

        (f)     Until the Release  Time,  Gridline  will  conduct its affairs so
that  at the  Closing,  no  representation  or  warranty  of  Gridline  will  be
inaccurate in any material respect, no covenant or agreement of Gridline will be
breached,  and no condition in this Agreement will remain  unfulfilled by reason
of the actions or omissions of Gridline. Except as otherwise consented to by NSC
in  writing,  until  the  Release  Time,  Gridline  will  use  its  commercially
reasonable  efforts to preserve the business  operations of Gridline intact,  to
keep available the services of its present personnel,  to preserve in full force
and  effect  the   contracts,   agreements,   instruments,   leases,   licenses,
arrangements,  and understandings of Gridline,  and to preserve the good will of

        (g)     Until the Release Time,  Gridline will immediately advise NSC in
a detailed  written  notice of any material fact or occurrence or any pending or
threatened  material  occurrence  of which it  obtains  knowledge  and which (if
existing and known at the date of the  execution of this  Agreement)  would have
been  required to be set forth or disclosed in or pursuant to this  Agreement or
the GRIDLINE  DISCLOSURE LETTER,  which (if existing and known at any time prior
to or at the  Closing)  would  make the  performance  by any party of a covenant
contained in this Agreement impossible or make such performance  materially more
difficult than in the absence of such fact or occurrence,  or which (if existing
and known at the time of the  Closing)  would cause a  condition  to any party's
obligations under this Agreement not to be fully satisfied.

        (h)     Gridline shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to insure
that  all  confidential  information  which  Gridline  or any of its  respective
officers,   directors,   employees,  counsel,  agents,  investment  bankers,  or
accountants  may now possess or may hereafter  create or obtain  relating to the
financial  condition,  results of operations,  businesses,  properties,  assets,
liabilities,  or future prospects of NSC, any affiliate thereof, or any customer
or supplier thereof or of any such affiliate shall not be published,  disclosed,
or made  accessible  by any of them to any other person or entity at any time or
used by any of them  except  in the  ordinary  course  of  business  and for the
benefit of Gridline;  provided,  however, that the restrictions of this sentence
shall not apply (A) after this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IV or
V hereof or  otherwise,  (B) as may  otherwise be required by law, (C) as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection  with the  enforcement of this Agreement,
or (D) to the  extent  the  information  shall have  otherwise  become  publicly
available.

misleading.

        (l)     Gridline shall timely prepare and file any declaration or filing

comparable charter documents, if any, under applicable law) thereof.

        (c)     Before  the  Gridline   Shareholders   release  any  information
concerning  this  Agreement  or any of the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement which is intended for, or may result in, public dissemination thereof,
the Gridline  Shareholders shall cooperate with NSC,

compliance with one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 and such
are not waived by Gridline.

        SECTION 4.04    EFFECT OF ABANDONMENT.  If the transactions contemplated
