The offering price to the public is $50.00 per share, with an underwriting
discount of $1.75 per share and a financial advisory fee payable to the
underwriter of $0.75 per share. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, we also
granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to 80,000 additional
shares of our 6.0% Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock on the same terms

underwriting agreement contains customary representations and warranties on our
part. The underwriting agreement also contains customary indemnification and
contribution provisions whereby we and the underwriter have agreed to indemnify
each other against certain liabilities. The 6.0% Convertible Exchangeable
Preferred Stock is being offered and sold pursuant to a prospectus dated
