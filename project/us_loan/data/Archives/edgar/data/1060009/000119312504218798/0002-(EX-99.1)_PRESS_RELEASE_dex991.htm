ACQUIRES FOR RESALE TWO NON-STRATEGIC HOSPITALS FROM VENTAS, INC. </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2"><B>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (December 22, 2004)</B> &#150; Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) (NYSE: KND) today announced that it has acquired two non-strategic hospitals formerly leased from Ventas, Inc. (&#147;Ventas&#148;) (NYSE:
VTR) for approximately $21.6 million in cash. The Company intends to dispose of these facilities as soon as practicable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The transaction involved the only two hospitals operated by the Company that are not operated as long-term acute care hospitals. In the transaction, the
Company paid $21.1 million to purchase the facilities and $0.5 million in lease termination fees. The current annual rent of approximately $1.2 million on these facilities terminated on the closing of the transaction. The Company financed its
obligations through the use of existing cash. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company
intends to dispose of the facilities as soon as practicable. The Company has targeted the third quarter of 2005 to complete the divestiture of these facilities. The Company expects to receive between $11 million and $13 million in proceeds from the
sales of these facilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, these facilities generated pretax losses of approximately $0.5 million. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company expects to record a loss on the proposed transaction equal to the difference between the total consideration paid to Ventas and the estimated
fair value of the assets acquired. The estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and related loss will be determined in conjunction with the Company&#146;s ongoing divestiture negotiations with third parties. The operations of the
facilities and the related loss on disposal will be accounted for as discontinued operations when the Company reports its audited financial results for 2004. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

and to focus our efforts on growing and enhancing our portfolio of 72 long-term acute care hospitals. The deal also marks another mutually beneficial transaction with Ventas.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

control costs, including labor and employee benefit costs; (j) the Company&#146;s ability to comply with the terms of its Corporate Integrity Agreement; (k) the Company&#146;s ability to successfully pursue its development activities and integrate
operations of new facilities; (l) the increase in the costs of defending and insuring against alleged professional liability claims and the Company&#146;s ability to predict the estimated costs related to such claims; (m) the Company&#146;s ability
to successfully reduce (by divestiture of operations or otherwise) its exposure to professional liability claims; and (n) the Company&#146;s ability to successfully dispose of unprofitable facilities. Many of these factors are beyond the
Company&#146;s control. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the
results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
