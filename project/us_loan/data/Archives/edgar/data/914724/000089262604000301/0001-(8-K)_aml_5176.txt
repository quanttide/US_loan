gave consideration to the above-mentioned matters and to the historical
audited financial statements of the partnerships which developed these

The Board of Trustees
AMLI Residential Properties Trust:

      We have audited the accompanying Historical Statement of Revenue in
Excess of Certain Expenses ("Historical Statement") of AMLI at Canterfield
(the "Community") for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This Historical
Statement is the responsibility of the management of AMLI Residential
Properties Trust.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Historical Statement based on our audit.

      We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the Historical Statement is free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the Historical Statement.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
Historical Statement.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

      The accompanying Historical Statement was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K for AMLI Residential Properties
Trust) as described in note 2.  This presentation is not intended to be a
complete presentation of the Community's revenue and expenses.

      In our opinion, the Historical Statement referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses
described in note 2 of the Community for the year ended December 31, 2003
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

                  NOTES TO HISTORICAL STATEMENTS OF REVENUE
                        IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN EXPENSES

           January 1, 2004 through September 14, 2004 (unaudited)
                      and year ended December 31, 2003
                           (Dollars in thousands)



NOTE 1 - COMMUNITY ACQUIRED

      AMLI Residential Properties Trust ("AMLI") acquired AMLI at
      Canterfield (the "Community"), a 352-unit apartment home community
      located in West Dundee, Illinois, on September 14, 2004 from the
      partners of a limited partnership in which Altman Development
      Corporation, an unrelated entity, was the sole general partner.  The
      Community was developed by Altman Development Corporation.  AMLI
      acquired 100% of the partnership interests in the Community at the
      time of purchase for an aggregate purchase price of $55,350.

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

      The Historical Statements of Revenue in Excess of Certain Expenses
      have been prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule 3-14 of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X and for inclusion
      in Form 8-K for AMLI and are not intended to be a complete
      presentation of the Community's revenue and expenses.

      The Historical Statements of Revenue in Excess of Certain Expenses
      are presented at 100% on the accrual basis of accounting in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
      United States of America.  The Historical Statements of Revenue in
      Excess of Certain Expenses are not representative of the actual
      operations for the periods presented as certain expenses, which may
      not be comparable to the expenses expected to be incurred in the
      proposed future operations of the Community, have been excluded.
      Expenses excluded consist of mortgage interest, depreciation,
      amortization and partnership expenses not directly related to the
      future operations of the Community.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      REVENUE RECOGNITION

      Apartment homes are rented under lease agreements with terms of one
      year or less.  Rental income is recognized when earned.  This policy
      effectively results in income recognition on the straight-line method
      over the related terms of the leases.

      PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEES

      The Community was managed by Altman Management Company, an unrelated
      entity of AMLI, pursuant to the terms of the management agreement.
      Property management fees were calculated at 4% of gross income.
      Subsequent to AMLI's acquisition of its partnership interest in the
      Community, this management agreement ceased and the Community became
      subject to the Master Property Management Agreement between AMLI and
      AMLI Management Company ("AMC") under which the Community will be
      managed by AMC for a property management fee of 3.0% of total
      revenue.

                INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
                ---------------------------------------------


The Board of Trustees
AMLI Residential Properties Trust:

      We have audited the accompanying Historical Statement of Revenue in
Excess of Certain Expenses ("Historical Statement") of AMLI at River Run
(the "Community") for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This Historical
Statement is the responsibility of the management of AMLI Residential
Properties Trust.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Historical Statement based on our audit.

      We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the Historical Statement is free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the Historical Statement.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
Historical Statement.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

      The accompanying Historical Statement was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K for AMLI Residential Properties
Trust) as described in note 2.  This presentation is not intended to be a
complete presentation of the Community's revenue and expenses.

      In our opinion, the Historical Statement referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses
described in note 2 of the Community for the year ended December 31, 2003
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

                  NOTES TO HISTORICAL STATEMENTS OF REVENUE
                        IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN EXPENSES

           January 1, 2004 through September 15, 2004 (unaudited)
                      and year ended December 31, 2003
                           (Dollars in thousands)



NOTE 1 - COMMUNITY ACQUIRED

      AMLI Residential Properties Trust ("AMLI") acquired AMLI at River Run
      (the "Community"), a 206-unit apartment home community located in
      Naperville, Illinois, on September 15, 2004 from the partners of a
      limited partnership in which Altman Development Corporation, an
      unrelated entity, was the sole general partner.  The Community was
      developed by Altman Development Corporation.  AMLI acquired 100% of
      the partnership interests in the Community at the time of purchase
      for an aggregate purchase price of $31,500.

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

      The Historical Statements of Revenue in Excess of Certain Expenses
      have been prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule 3-14 of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X and for inclusion
      in Form 8-K for AMLI and are not intended to be a complete
      presentation of the community's revenue and expenses.

      The Historical Statements of Revenue in Excess of Certain Expenses
      are presented at 100% on the accrual basis of accounting in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
      United States of America.  The Historical Statements of Revenue in
      Excess of Certain Expenses are not representative of the actual
      operations for the periods presented as certain expenses, which may
      not be comparable to the expenses expected to be incurred in the
      proposed future operations of the Community, have been excluded.
      Expenses excluded consist of mortgage interest, depreciation,
      amortization and partnership expenses not directly related to the
      future operations of the Community.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      REVENUE RECOGNITION

      Apartment homes are rented under lease agreements with terms of one
      year or less.  Rental income is recognized when earned.  This policy
      effectively results in income recognition on the straight-line method
      over the related terms of the leases.

      PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEES

      The Community was managed by Altman Management Company, an unrelated
      entity of AMLI, pursuant to the terms of the management agreement.
      Property management fees were calculated at 4% of gross income.
      Subsequent to AMLI's acquisition of its partnership interest in the
      Community, this management agreement ceased and the Community became
      subject to the Master Property Management Agreement between AMLI and
      AMLI Management Company ("AMC"), under which the Community will be
      managed by AMC for a property management fee of 3.0% of total
      revenue.

The Board of Trustees
AMLI Residential Properties Trust:

      We have audited the accompanying Historical Statement of Revenue in
Excess of Certain Expenses ("Historical Statement") of AMLI at Kirkland
Crossing (the "Community") for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This
Historical Statement is the responsibility of the management of AMLI
Residential Properties Trust.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Historical Statement based on our audit.

      We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the Historical Statement is free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the Historical Statement.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
Historical Statement.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

      The accompanying Historical Statement was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K for AMLI Residential Properties
Trust) as described in note 2.  This presentation is not intended to be a
complete presentation of the Community's revenue and expenses.

      In our opinion, the Historical Statement referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses
described in note 2 of the Community for the year ended December 31, 2003
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

                  NOTES TO HISTORICAL STATEMENTS OF REVENUE
                        IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN EXPENSES

     Period from January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004 (unaudited)
                      and year ended December 31, 2003
                           (Dollars in thousands)



NOTE 1 - COMMUNITY ACQUIRED

      AMLI Residential Properties Trust ("AMLI") acquired AMLI at Kirkland
      Crossing (the "Community"), a 266-unit apartment home community
      located in Aurora, Illinois, on October 20, 2004 from the partners of
      a limited partnership in which Altman Development Corporation, an
      unrelated entity, was the sole general partner.  The Community was
      developed by Altman Development Corporation.  AMLI acquired 100% of
      the partnership interests in the Community at the time of purchase
      for an aggregate purchase of $39,100.  During 2003, the Community was
      under development, and initial rental operations commenced during
      August 2003.  The Community's average occupancy rate was 48.9% for
      the period from January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004.
      Stabilized occupancy was reached in October 2004.

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

      The Historical Statements of Revenue in Excess of Certain Expenses
      have been prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule 3-14 of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X and for inclusion
      in Form 8-K for AMLI and are not intended to be a complete
      presentation of the Community's revenue and expenses.

      The Historical Statements of Revenue in Excess of Certain Expenses
      are presented at 100% on the accrual basis of accounting in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
      United States of America.  The Historical Statements of Revenue in
      Excess of Certain Expenses are not representative of the actual
      operations for the periods presented as certain expenses, which may
      not be comparable to the expenses expected to be incurred in the
      proposed future operations of the Community, have been excluded.
      Expenses excluded consist of mortgage interest, depreciation,
      amortization and partnership expenses not directly related to the
      future operations of the Community.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      REVENUE RECOGNITION

      Apartment homes are rented under lease agreements with terms of one
      year or less.  Rental income is recognized when earned.  This policy
      effectively results in income recognition on the straight-line method
      over the related terms of the leases.

      PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEES

      The Community was managed by Altman Management Company, an unrelated
      entity of AMLI, pursuant to the terms of the management agreement.
      Property management fees were calculated at $10,000 per month
      beginning with the commencement of "lease-up" which occurred in
      August 2003.  Subsequent to AMLI's acquisition of its partnership
      interests in the Community, this management agreement ceased and the
      Community became subject to the Master Property Management Agreement
      between AMLI and AMLI Management Company ("AMC"), under which the
      Community will be managed by AMC for a property management fee of
      3.0% of total revenue.

                        Independent Auditors' Report
                        ----------------------------


The Board of Trustees
AMLI Residential Properties Trust:

We have audited the accompanying Combined Historical Statement of Revenue
in Excess of Certain Expenses ("Historical Statement") of the Communities
Acquired from The Comptroller of the New York as Trustee of the Common
Retirement Fund, a New York trust in 2004 ("Communities") for the year
ended December 31, 2003.  This Historical Statement is the responsibility
of the management of AMLI Residential Properties Trust.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Historical Statement based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Statement is free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Communities' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we
express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical
Statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the Historical Statement.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The accompanying Historical Statement was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K of AMLI Residential Properties Trust)
as described in note 2.  This presentation is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the Communities' revenue and expenses.

In our opinion, the Historical Statement referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the revenue and certain expenses described in
note 2 of the Communities for the year ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

(1)   COMMUNITIES ACQUIRED

      The communities acquired from The Comptroller of the State of New

      ("Communities") consist of AMLI at Lake Clearwater ("Lake
      Clearwater"), a 216 apartment home community located in Indianapolis,
      Indiana and AMLI at Wynnewood Farms ("Wynnewood Farms"), a 232

      Properties Trust (the "Company" or "AMLI") in separate partnerships
      with The Comptroller of the State of New York as Trustee of the
      Common Retirement Fund, a New York trust ("NYCRF").  AMLI owned a 25%

           NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

                             September 30, 2004
                                 (Unaudited)
                           (Dollars in thousands)


 (A)  The Acquisition Communities column reflects acquisition of AMLI at
      Kirkland Crossing ("Kirkland") and the purchase of the New York State
      Common Retirement Fund's ("NYSCF") 75% partnership interest in AMLI
      at Wynnewood Farms ("Wynnewood") and AMLI at Lake Clearwater
      ("Clearwater") that AMLI did not already own.  Kirkland is a 266-unit
      apartment community located in Aurora, Illinois, which was
      acquired by AMLI in October 2004 for $39,100 from The Altman
      Companies. Wynnewood is a 232-apartment home community located in
      Overland Park, Kansas and Clearwater is a 216-apartment home
      community located in Indianapolis, Indiana.  In November 2004, NYSCF
      assigned all of its interest in the partnerships to AMLI for $16,699
      and $14,700 less $139 and $165, representing its 75% share of unpaid
      real estate taxes assumed by AMLI in Wynnewood and Clearwater,
      respectively.  AMLI paid cash for the balance of the acquisition
      price, which was funded from borrowings under its primary line of
      credit.

 (B)  The adjustment reflects the elimination of AMLI's investments in
      Wynnewood and Clearwater upon acquisition of its partner's interest
      in the Acquisition Communities.

 (C)  The adjustment represents tenant security deposits and miscellaneous
      receivables transferred to the Company in conjunction with the
      acquisition.

 (D)  The adjustment represents the amount the Company borrowed from its
      primary line of credit to fund the balance of the acquisition cost of
      the Acquisition Communities. The primary line of credit matures in
      May 2006.

 (E)  The amount represents liabilities assumed by AMLI for accrued real
      estate taxes, accrued operating expenses, tenant security deposits
      and other liabilities for which AMLI received credit against the
      purchase price paid for the Communities.

     NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

                    Nine Months Ended September 30, 2004
                                 (Unaudited)
                           (Dollars in thousands)


 (A)  The "Historical" column reflects the historical consolidated
      statement of operations of AMLI Residential Properties Trust (the
      "Company" or "AMLI") for the nine months ended September 31, 2004.

 (B)  These adjustments relate to communities acquired ("Communities")
      subsequent to December 31, 2003 to include the operations AMLI at
      River Run, AMLI at Canterfield, AMLI at Westcliff, AMLI on the
      Fairway, AMLI on Eldridge Parkway ("Eldridge") and AMLI at Ibis for
      the period from January 1, 2004 through the respective dates of
      acquisition.

 (C)  The "Acquisition Communities" column reflects the historical revenue
      and certain operating expenses of AMLI at Kirkland Crossing
      ("Kirkland"), AMLI at Lake Clearwater ("Clearwater") and AMLI at
      Wynnewood Farms ("Wynnewood"), which were not owned by AMLI as of
      September 30, 2004.  Kirkland includes operating results during the
      lease-up period and occupancy during the period prior to AMLI's
      acquisition of the Community was 48.9%.  Kirkland reached stabilized
      occupancy as of the acquisition closing date.

 (D)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the reduction in property
      management fees that will be charged at a reduced rate of 3% of total
      revenue subsequent to the purchase of the Acquisition Communities and
      the Communities based on the Master Property Management Agreement
      between the Company and AMLI Management Company, a consolidated
      affiliate of AMLI.

 (E)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the depreciation relating to the
      Acquisition Communities and the increased depreciation of the
      Communities acquired subsequent to December 31, 2003.  In-place lease
      intangible asset related to the acquisition of the communities has
      been fully depreciated as of December 31, 2003.

 (F)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the reduction of AMLI's share of
      income from partnerships as a result of AMLI's acquisition of its
      partner's entire interests in two partnerships that owned Clearwater
      and Wynnewood, which are included in the Acquisition Communities.

 (G)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the net increase in interest
      expense as a result of a $40,000 short-term loan at LIBOR plus 1%, a
      new $38,709 first mortgage loan on Eldridge and additional borrowings
      on the Company's primary line of credit to fund the acquisition
      costs of the Acquisition Communities and the Communities.

 (H)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the reduction of property
      management fees and asset management fees earned from the Communities
      by a consolidated affiliate, and the corresponding elimination of the
      related costs.

 (I)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the minority holders' 6.6% share of
      the pro forma net income of the Company.

                      AMLI RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TRUST

     NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

                        Year Ended December 31, 2003
                                 (Unaudited)
                           (Dollars in thousands)



 (A)  The "Historical" column reflects the historical consolidated
      statement of operations of AMLI Residential Properties Trust (the
      "Company" or "AMLI") for the year ended December 31, 2003.

 (B)  These adjustments relate to communities acquired ("Communities")
      subsequent to December 31, 2002 to include the operations of AMLI at
      Castle Creek ("Castle Creek"), AMLI Creekside ("Creekside"), AMLI at
      Regents Crest ("Regents Crest"), AMLI on Spring Mill ("Spring Mill"),
      AMLI at Oakhurst North ("Oakhurst"), AMLI at Danada Farms ("Danada"),
      AMLI at Oak Bend ("Oak Bend") and AMLI Knox-Henderson for the period
      from January 1, 2003 through the respective dates of acquisition.  In
      addition, the pro forma adjustments include the operations of AMLI at
      Ibis, AMLI on Eldridge Parkway, AMLI at Westcliff, AMLI on the
      Fairway, AMLI at Canterfield and AMLI at River Run for the year ended
      December 31, 2003.

 (C)  The "Acquisition Communities" column reflects the historical revenue
      and certain operating expenses of AMLI at Kirkland Crossing
      ("Kirkland"), AMLI at Lake Clearwater and AMLI at Wynnewood Farms for
      the year ended December 31, 2003, which was not owned by AMLI during
      2003.  Kirkland was under development during 2003, and includes
      initial rental operating results only for November and December 2003,
      during which occupancy averaged 10.4%.

 (D)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the reduction in property
      management fees that will be charged at a reduced rate a reduced rate
      of 3% of total revenue subsequent to the purchase of the Acquisition
      Communities and the Communities based on the Master Property
      Management Agreement between the Company and AMLI Management Company,
      an unconsolidated affiliate of AMLI.

 (E)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the depreciation relating to the
      Acquisition Communities and the increased depreciation relating to
      the Communities acquired subsequent to December 31, 2002 and 2003,
      and also includes an additional $12,959 of depreciation of cost
      allocated to the value of existing leases on the dates of
      acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2003 this allocated cost has been
      fully depreciated.

 (F)  The pro forma reflects the reduction of the Company's share of income
      from partnerships as a result of AMLI's acquisition of its partners'
      entire interests in seven partnerships that owned Castle Creek,
      Creekside, Regents Crest, Spring Mill, Oakhurst, Danada and Oak Bend.

 (G)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the net increase in interest
      expense as a result of mortgages assumed by AMLI relating to the
      acquisition of Danada, Regents Crest and Oak Bend, a new short-term
      loan, a new first-mortgage loan secured by AMLI on Eldridge Parkway
      and additional borrowings on AMLI's primary line of credit to fund
      the balance of the acquisition costs of the Acquisition Communities
      and the Communities.  The pro forma increase in interest expense was
      offset in part by the reduction of interest on the three mortgages
      assumed as a result of imputing lower interest rates based on AMLI's
      current borrowing rate.

 (H)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the reduction of property
      management fees and asset management fees earned from the communities
      by an unconsolidated affiliate.

 (I)  The pro forma adjustment reflects the minority holders' 6.6% share of
      pro forma net income of AMLI.
