                       AMLI RESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCES NEW
                      $110 MILLION UNSECURED TERM LOAN


(CHICAGO, IL)  AMLI RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TRUST (NYSE: AML) announces the
closing of a $110 million unsecured loan with a bank group that includes
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, PNC Bank National
Association, Commerzbank AG, and Comerica Bank. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. also
acted as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner for this facility.

The loan, which provides for an initial four-year term and a one-year
extension at AMLI's option, carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%.
AMLI used the proceeds to pay down a substantial portion of the outstanding
balance on its existing revolving line of credit, which was recently
increased to fund acquisition activity.

In a related transaction, AMLI entered into interest rate swap agreements
for the period July 1, 2005 through December 20, 2009 effectively fixing
the interest rate on $100 million of the variable rate term loan at a rate
of 3.99% plus the loan spread, or 4.99%.

"We appreciate the strong support we received from the banks who
participated in this facility, all of which are in AMLI's existing line of
credit", commented Andrew J. Bruce, AMLI Vice President of Capital Markets.
"Through this financing and the related interest rate swaps, we have
extended AMLI's debt maturities and substantially reduced the Company's
exposure to future interest rate volatility."

The AMLI<registered trademark> portfolio currently includes 74 apartment
communities containing 27,594 apartment homes, with an additional 1,854
apartment homes under development or in lease-up in five locations. AMLI is
focused on the development, acquisition and management of institutional
quality multifamily communities in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest and
Mountain regions of the U.S. AMLI Residential also serves as institutional
advisor and asset manager for large pension funds, tax-exempt foundations
and other financial institutions through AMLI's co-investment business.
