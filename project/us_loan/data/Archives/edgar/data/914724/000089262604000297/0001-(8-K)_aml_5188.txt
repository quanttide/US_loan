ITEM 2.03   CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION

      On December 20, 2004 AMLI Residential Properties, L.P., whose sole
General Partner and 95% owner is AMLI Residential Properties Trust (NYSE:
AML), obtained a new $110 million unsecured loan with a bank group that
includes Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, PNC Bank National
Association, Commerzbank AG, and Comerica Bank.  AMLI has guaranteed
repayment to the lender.  The term loan may be prepaid in whole or in part
at any time.

      The loan, which provides for an initial four-year term and a one-year
extension at AMLI's option, carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%.
Interest only is payable monthly to maturity.  Acceleration may result from
the occurrence of a change in control or from non-compliance with certain
covenants in the loan agreement, all of which is customary for bank
financings of this type.

      AMLI used the proceeds to pay down a substantial portion of the
outstanding balances on its other unsecured borrowings.

      In a separate but related transaction, AMLI entered into interest
rate swap agreements for the period July 1, 2005 through December 20, 2009,
effectively fixing the interest rate on $100 million of the variable rate
term loan at a fixed rate of 3.986% plus the loan spread.

      For additional information regarding this transaction, please see the
term loan agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10 to this Report
on Form 8-K, and the press release dated December 22, 2004, a copy of which
is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K.
