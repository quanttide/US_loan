Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     The Valmont  board of directors on December 20, 2004  established  director
compensation for fiscal 2005.  Non-employee directors will receive (1) an annual
retainer of $55,000,  (2) $2,500 for each board meeting  attended ($1,000 if the
participation was via teleconference), and (3) $2,000 for each committee meeting
attended.  The lead director  receives an  additional  $25,000 per year and each
committee chairman receives an additional  $10,000 per year.  Directors have the
ability to receive cash fees in the form of deferred  compensation which accrues
interest indexed to U.S. Government Bonds compounded monthly.

     Non-employee  directors also receive equity compensation as provided in the
stockholder-approved 2002 Stock Plan. The equity compensation consists of (1) an
annual  grant of 2,000  shares  of common  stock  and (2) an  annual  grant of a
nonqualified  stock option for 4,000 shares of common stock  exercisable  at the
fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The equity
grants  are  made  annually  on the  date  of and  following  completion  of the
Company's annual stockholders' meeting. The common stock grant is forfeited if a
director's  services terminate for any reason other than death,  retirement from
the board at mandatory  retirement  age, or  resignation or failure to stand for
re-election, in any case without the prior approval of the board.

     The Valmont board of directors,  upon  recommendation  of the  Compensation
Committee,  on December 20, 2004  established  fiscal 2005 base salaries for the
five executive  officers named in the 2004 proxy  statement (the  "Executives"):
Mogens Bay, $750,000;  Terry McClain,  $309,000;  Robert Meaney,  $286,300;  Tom
Pogge,  $203,700;  and Mark Treinen,  $187,200.  The  Compensation  Committee on
December  19, 2004  established  the  performance  measures  for the fiscal 2005
annual incentives for the Executives. Such incentives were established under the
stockholder-approved  Valmont  Executive  Incentive Plan. A target incentive was
established  for each  executive  ranging from 35% to 100% of base  salary,  and
performance  goals were set based on earnings per share  performance.  A minimum
threshold  level of earnings per share must be attained  before any incentive is
earned  and  incentives  are  earned  based on  specific  performance  levels of
earnings per share.  Payout  under the plan to any  Executive is capped at three
times the target incentive.

     The  Compensation  Committee  on  December  19, 2004 also  established  the
performance  measures for  executives for the long-term  incentive  program with
respect to the three-year  cycle of fiscal 2005 - fiscal 2007.  Such  incentives
were established  under the  stockholder-approved  Valmont  Executive  Incentive
Plan.  Targets were  established  for each Executive  ranging from 25% to 60% of
base salary,  which amount is converted to  performance  shares.  The  Committee
established  performance  goals  based on return  on  invested  capital  for the
Company over the three-year  term,  with a performance  matrix pursuant to which
the performance  shares may be increased or decreased based on greater or lesser
levels of  performance.  Earned  performance  shares are valued at the Company's
stock price at the end of the performance  period and awards may be paid in cash
or in shares of common stock, or any combination of cash and stock as determined
by the Committee.  Payout under the plan to any Executive is capped at two times
the target incentive. The Committee on December 19, 2004 also granted restricted
shares  and  stock  options  to the  Executives  as  follows:  Mr.  Bay,  33,333
restricted  shares; Mr. McClain,  10,000 restricted  shares;  Mr. Meaney,  8,000
restricted shares; Mr. Pogge, 6,000 stock options; and Mr. Treinen,  6,000 stock
options.  These grants were made  pursuant to the  stockholder-approved  Valmont
2002 Stock Plan.
