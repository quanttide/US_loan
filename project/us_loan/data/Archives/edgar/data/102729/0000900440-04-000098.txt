Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     The Valmont  board of directors on December 20, 2004  established  director
compensation for fiscal 2005.  Non-employee directors will receive (1) an annual
retainer of $55,000,  (2) $2,500 for each board meeting  attended ($1,000 if the
participation was via teleconference), and (3) $2,000 for each committee meeting
attended.  The lead director  receives an  additional  $25,000 per year and each
committee chairman receives an additional  $10,000 per year.  Directors have the
ability to receive cash fees in the form of deferred  compensation which accrues
interest indexed to U.S. Government Bonds compounded monthly.

     Non-employee  directors also receive equity compensation as provided in the
stockholder-approved 2002 Stock Plan. The equity compensation consists of (1) an
annual  grant of 2,000  shares  of common  stock  and (2) an  annual  grant of a
nonqualified  stock option for 4,000 shares of common stock  exercisable  at the
fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The equity
grants  are  made  annually  on the  date  of and  following  completion  of the
Company's annual stockholders' meeting. The common stock grant is forfeited if a
director's  services terminate for any reason other than death,  retirement from
the board at mandatory  retirement  age, or  resignation or failure to stand for
re-election, in any case without the prior approval of the board.

     The Valmont board of directors,  upon  recommendation  of the  Compensation
Committee,  on December 20, 2004  established  fiscal 2005 base salaries for the
five executive  officers named in the 2004 proxy  statement (the  "Executives"):
Mogens Bay, $750,000;  Terry McClain,  $309,000;  Robert Meaney,  $286,300;  Tom
Pogge,  $203,700;  and Mark Treinen,  $187,200.  The  Compensation  Committee on
December  19, 2004  established  the  performance  measures  for the fiscal 2005
annual incentives for the Executives. Such incentives were established under the
stockholder-approved  Valmont  Executive  Incentive Plan. A target incentive was
established  for each  executive  ranging from 35% to 100% of base  salary,  and
performance  goals were set based on earnings per share  performance.  A minimum
threshold  level of earnings per share must be attained  before any incentive is
earned  and  incentives  are  earned  based on  specific  performance  levels of
earnings per share.  Payout  under the plan to any  Executive is capped at three
times the target incentive.

     The  Compensation  Committee  on  December  19, 2004 also  established  the
performance  measures for  executives for the long-term  incentive  program with
respect to the three-year  cycle of fiscal 2005 - fiscal 2007.  Such  incentives
were established  under the  stockholder-approved  Valmont  Executive  Incentive
Plan.  Targets were  established  for each Executive  ranging from 25% to 60% of
base salary,  which amount is converted to  performance  shares.  The  Committee
established  performance  goals  based on return  on  invested  capital  for the
Company over the three-year  term,  with a performance  matrix pursuant to which
the performance  shares may be increased or decreased based on greater or lesser
levels of  performance.  Earned  performance  shares are valued at the Company's
stock price at the end of the performance  period and awards may be paid in cash
or in shares of common stock, or any combination of cash and stock as determined
by the Committee.  Payout under the plan to any Executive is capped at two times
the target incentive. The Committee on December 19, 2004 also granted restricted
shares  and  stock  options  to the  Executives  as  follows:  Mr.  Bay,  33,333
restricted  shares; Mr. McClain,  10,000 restricted  shares;  Mr. Meaney,  8,000
restricted shares; Mr. Pogge, 6,000 stock options; and Mr. Treinen,  6,000 stock
options.  These grants were made  pursuant to the  stockholder-approved  Valmont
2002 Stock Plan.

                            VALMONT INDUSTRIES, INC.
                           RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT  entered  into  effective  (Date)  ("Grant  Date") by and between
Valmont  Industries,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  ("Company")  and  (Employee
Name), an employee of the Company ("Employee").

1. Award.

     (a) Shares: Pursuant to the Valmont 2002 Stock Plan ("Plan"), (# of Shares)
shares (the  "Restricted  Shares") of the Company's  common stock, par value One
Dollar  per  share  ("Stock"),  shall  be  issued  as  hereinafter  provided  in
Employee's name subject to certain restrictions thereon.

     (b) Plan Incorporated: Employee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan,
and agrees that this award of  Restricted  Shares shall be subject to all of the
terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, including future amendments thereto,
if any,  pursuant to the terms  thereof,  which Plan is  incorporated  herein by
reference as part of this Agreement.

2. Dividends and Voting Rights.

The Employee shall be entitled to receive any dividends paid with respect to the
Restricted  Shares that become  payable;  provided,  however,  that no dividends
shall be payable to or for the benefit of the Employee for the Restricted Shares
with  respect to the record  dates  occurring  prior to the Grant Date,  or with
respect to record  dates  occurring  on or after the date,  if any, on which the
Employee has forfeited the Restricted  Shares. The Employee shall be entitled to
vote the Restricted  Shares to the same extent as would have been  applicable to
the Employee if the Employee was then vested in the shares;  provided,  however,
that the  Employee  shall not be  entitled  to vote the shares  with  respect to
record dates for such voting  rights  arising  prior to the Grant Date,  or with
respect to record  dates  occurring  on or after the date,  if any, on which the
Employee has forfeited the Restricted Shares.

3. Restricted Shares.

Employee  hereby  accepts  the  Restricted  Shares  when  issued and agrees with
respect thereto as follows:

     (a)  Forfeiture  Restrictions:  The  Restricted  Shares  may  not be  sold,
assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred,  encumbered
or disposed of to the extent then  subject to the  Forfeiture  Restrictions  (as
hereinafter  defined),  and in the event of termination of Employee's employment
with the  Company  or  employing  subsidiary  for any  reason  other  than those
described below,  Employee shall, for no  consideration,  forfeit to the Company
all Restricted Shares to the extent then subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions.
The  prohibition  against  transfer and the  obligation to forfeit and surrender
Restricted  Shares to the Company  upon  termination  of  employment  are herein
referred to as "Forfeiture  Restrictions." The Forfeiture  Restrictions shall be
binding  upon and  enforceable  against any  transferee  of  Restricted  Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse as to all
of the  Restricted  Shares on the earlier of (i) the  occurrence  of a Change of
Control  (as such term is  defined  in the  Plan),  (ii) the date of  Employee's
employment with the Company as terminated by reason of death,  total  disability
(as  determined  by the  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors  (the
"Committee") using the definition of total disability of the Company's long term
disability plan), or normal  retirement on or after age sixty-two,  or (iii) the
Employee's  involuntary  termination  from the  Company  prior to age  sixty-two
without  cause.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  "Cause"  shall  include the
Employee's (i) indictment, conviction, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a
misdemeanor  involving  moral  turpitude or a felony or (ii) breach of duties to
the Company which cause  material  financial  loss to the Company,  which is not
cured within ten days  following  receipt by Employee of written notice from the
Board of Directors.

     (b) Certificates:  A certificate  evidencing the Restricted Shares shall be
issued by the Company in Employee's  name,  or at the option of the Company,  in
the name of a nominee of the  Company,  pursuant  to which  Employee  shall have
voting  rights and shall be entitled to receive all  dividends  as  described in
Paragraph 2 of this Agreement.  The certificate  shall bear a legend  evidencing
the nature of the Restricted  Shares,  and the Company may cause the certificate
to be delivered  upon  issuance to the Secretary of the Company or to such other
depository as may be designated by the Company as a depository  for  safekeeping
until the forfeiture occurs or the Forfeiture Restrictions lapse pursuant to the
terms of the Plan and this Award. Upon the lapse of the Forfeiture  Restrictions
without  forfeiture  and  Employee's  delivery to the Company of the  Restricted
Shares,  the Company shall cause a new  certificate or certificates to be issued
without  legend in the name of  Employee  for the shares  upon which  Forfeiture
Restrictions lapsed. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
issuance or delivery of any shares of Stock (whether subject to the restrictions
or  unrestricted)  may be postponed for such period as may be required to comply
with  applicable  requirements  of  any  national  securities  exchange  or  any
requirements under any law or regulation  applicable to the issuance or delivery
of such  shares.  The  Company  shall not be  obligated  to issue or deliver any
shares of Stock if the issuance or delivery thereof shall constitute a violation
of any provision of any law or any regulation of any  governmental  authority or
any national securities exchange.

4. Withholding of Tax.

To the extent that the receipt of the Restricted Shares or the lapse of any
Forfeiture Restriction results in income to Employee for federal or state income
tax purposes, Employee shall deliver to the Company at the time of such receipt
or lapse,  as the case may be,  such  amount of money or shares of  unrestricted
Stock as the Company may require to meet its withholding obligation under
applicable tax laws or regulations, and if Employee fails to do so, the Company
is authorized to withhold from any cash or Stock remuneration then or thereafter
payable to Employee any tax required to be withheld by reason of such resulting
compensation income.

5. Administration.

The  authority to manage and control the operation  and  administration  of this
Agreement  shall be vested in the  Committee,  and the Committee  shall have all
powers with respect to this  Agreement  as it has with respect to the Plan.  Any
interpretation  of the  Agreement by the  Committee  and any decision made by it
with respect to the Agreement is final and binding.

6. Binding Effect.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and insure to the benefit of any successors
to the Company and all persons lawfully claiming under Employee.

7. Governing Law.

This agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance  with, the laws
of the State of Nebraska.

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  Company  has caused  this  Agreement  to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized, and Employee has executed this
Agreement, effective as of the Grant Date.
