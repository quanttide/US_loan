ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

     On December  14,  2004, a lawsuit was  commenced  against the Company,  its
Chief Executive Officer and President by Nazar Talib, individually and on behalf
of certain  Company  shareholders  in the United States  District  Court for the
Eastern  District of Arkansas.  Mr. Talib is a stockbroker  that was involved in
the  solicitation  of certain  foreign  investors in the Company.  The Complaint
alleges  that the Company (i)  engaged in the sale of  unregistered  securities;
(ii) made certain  misrepresentations  regarding the investment in the Company's
securities;  (iii) breached the provisions of the Arkansas  Securities  Act; and
(iv) breached its contractual  obligations to the plaintiffs.  In addition,  the
Complaint alleges that Messrs. Kovar and Kent breached their fiduciary duties to
the Company. The plaintiffs have alleged that they are entitled to rescission of
their investment as an equitable remedy and have further sought damages from the
Company  and  Messrs.   Kovar  and  Kent.

        The  Company  vigorously  denies  the allegations  in the Complaint and
believes that the  allegations  have no merit.  The Company was served with the
Complaint  on December  17, 2004 and intends to undertake a vigorous defense of
these allegations and seek  compensatory  relief from Mr. Talib by initiating
counterclaims against him.
