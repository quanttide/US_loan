currency and interest rate fluctuations; increases in the Company's leverage;  the Company's ability to effectively
integrate acquisitions; changes in the Company's business strategy or development plans; the timing and cost of plant
closures; the success of new technology; and increases in the cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including
