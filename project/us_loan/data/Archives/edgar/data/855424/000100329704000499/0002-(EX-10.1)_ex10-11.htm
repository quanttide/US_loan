<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>7.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedy</u>.&nbsp;
The Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by the Company
as a result of a breach of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 hereof might be
irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company for such a
breach would be an inadequate remedy.&nbsp; Consequently, the Company will have the
right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief
to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically
enforce the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 hereof.</p>



<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>7.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Covenants of Articles 5 and 6 are Essential and
Independent Covenants</u>.&nbsp; The covenants by the Executive in Articles 5 and 6

to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement or employed or continued the employment of the Executive.&nbsp; The Company
and the Executive have independently consulted their respective counsel and
have been advised in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety
of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature of the business conducted
by the Company.&nbsp; If the Executive's employment hereunder expires or is terminated,
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect as is necessary or
appropriate to enforce the covenants and agreements of the Executive in
Articles 5 and 6.</p>



<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>7.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Representations and Warranties by the Executive</u>.&nbsp;
The Executive represents and warrants to the Company that (a) the Executive has
never taken any action of the types set forth in Section 4.03(b) though (f) and
(b) the execution and delivery by the Executive of this Agreement does not, and
the performance by the Executive of the Executive's obligations hereunder will
not, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both: (i)
violate any judgment, writ, injunction, or order of any court, arbitrator, or
governmental agency applicable to the Executive; or (ii) conflict with, result
in the breach of any provisions of or the termination of, or constitute a
default under, any agreement to which the Executive is a party or by which the
Executive is or may be bound.</p>
