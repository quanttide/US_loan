<P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">AMENDMENT NO. 1, dated December 21, 2004, to Rights Agreement (the &#147;Rights Agreement&#148;), dated July 31, 2000, between OSI Systems, Inc., a
California corporation (&#147;Company&#148;), and U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation, as rights agent (the &#147;Rights Agent&#148;). The parties agree as follows: </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT

Person</U>&#148; shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 10% or more of the Common
Shares of the Company then outstanding, but shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, any entity holding Common
Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or any Person who or which is the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding on the date of this Agreement, until such time hereafter as any of such
Persons shall become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company (other than by means of a stock dividend, stock split or other pro rata distribution of securities of the Company and other than pursuant to any employee

Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company (other than by means of a stock dividend, stock split or other pro rata distribution of securities of the Company and other than pursuant to any employee benefit
plan of the Company or the exercise of any options or other rights granted thereunder), then such Person shall be deemed to be an &#147;Acquiring Person.&#148; Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall become an &#147;Acquiring Person&#148; as
the result of an acquisition of Common Shares of the Company if (x) such Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more (but less than 20%) of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, and (y) such Person has reported or is permitted to
report such ownership on Schedule 13G under the Exchange Act in effect on the date of the Agreement (or any comparable or successor report). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a
