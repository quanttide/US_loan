ITEM  8.01.  OTHER  EVENTS

     On  December  23,  2004,  Green  Mountain Power Corporation (the "Company")
received  an order from the Vermont Public Service Board ("VPSB") permitting the
Company's  requested  1.9  percent rate increase to go into effect on January 1,
2005,  as  scheduled.  The 1.9 percent increase is pursuant to a plan previously
approved  by  the  VPSB,  and will be the first rate increase for Green Mountain
Power  customers  since  2001.

In  the  same  order,  the  VPSB  denied  the requests of AARP and International
Business  Machines Corporation ("IBM") to suspend the effective date of the 1.9%
rate  increase.  The VPSB, however, granted the requests of AARP and IBM to open
an  investigation  into the Company's rate increase, appointed a hearing officer
and  scheduled  a  pre-hearing  conference  in the investigation for January 11,
2005.  The  rate  increase  will  be  in  effect during the pendency of the VPSB
investigation.

Under Vermont law, five persons adversely affected by a rate change may petition
the  VPSB  to  suspend and/or investigate a requested change in rates.  AARP and
IBM filed such petitions.  The VPSB ruled that it is obligated under Vermont law
to  open an investigation into the reasonableness of the Company's rate increase
upon  the  filing  of  these  petitions.  The  VPSB  also  ruled  that  neither
organization  had satisfied the requirement that five persons join the petition,
but  allowed  these organizations until January 7, 2005 to amend their petitions
to  join  five  persons adversely affected by the rate increase.  If AARP or IBM
fails  to  so  amend  its  petition  in a timely manner, the VPSB ruled that the
petition  shall  be  dismissed.  If  both  AARP  and  IBM fail to so amend their
petitions,  the  investigation  will  be  terminated.

On December 23, 2004, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration of the VPSB
order,  arguing  that  Vermont  law  does  not  require  the  VPSB  to  open  an
investigation  upon filing of a ratepayer petition, that the VPSB has discretion
whether  to  open  such  an  investigation  and that the VPSB should reverse its
decision  to  open  an investigation because it decision was based solely on its
erroneous  conclusion  that  it  was  required  to  do  so.  The  motion  for
reconsideration  is  pending.  The  VPSB has announced that any responses to the
Company's  motion  must  be  filed  by  December  29,  2004.
