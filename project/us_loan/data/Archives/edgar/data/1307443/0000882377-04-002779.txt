for a period of 90 days or longer for a price equal to the Repurchase Price
therefor."

         (B) The phrase "Furthermore, the Master Servicer will have the option
to purchase, at any one time, 1.00% (and in any case, at least 5 Mortgage Loans)
of the Mortgage Loans, by aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Loans as of such date, at a purchase price equal to the aggregate fair market
value of such Mortgage Loans," in Section 3.13(g) of the Servicing Agreement
shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the phrase "Furthermore, the
Master Servicer will have the option to purchase, at any one time, 1.00% (and in
any case, at least 5 Mortgage Loans) of the Mortgage Loans, by aggregate Stated
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of such date, at a price equal to the
