Item 3.03 -Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.

         On December 27, 2004, Calgon Carbon Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to approval by the Company's Board of
Directors, entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement ("Amendment
No. 2") by and between the Company and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (as
successor to First Chicago Trust Company of New York), dated as of February 3,
1995, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated as of April 23, 1999 (as so
amended, the "Rights Agreement"). Amendment No. 2 reduces from 20% to 10% the
threshold at which the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) will be
triggered. According to the Rights Agreement as amended, subject to certain
exceptions described in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will be triggered
after a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the
Company's outstanding common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
upon consummation of which such person or group will become the beneficial
owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock. Current
holders of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock will not
trigger the Rights unless any such holder acquires an additional 1% of the
Company's common shares or, in the case of a holder that reports its
beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, such holder increases its ownership
above 15%. A copy of Amendment No. 2 is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

         On December 27, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing
the approval and implementation of Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement. A
copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated
herein by reference.

                      AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT


         This Amendment No. 2 to Rights Agreement, dated as of December 27,
2004 (this "Amendment"), is entered into by and between Calgon Carbon
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Equiserve Trust
Company, N.A. (as successor to First Chicago Trust Company of New York) (the

         WHEREAS, the Company and the Rights Agent are parties to that certain
Rights Agreement dated as of February 3, 1995, as amended by Amendment No. 1
thereto dated as of April 23, 1999 (as so amended, the "Rights Agreement");

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved and
adopted this Amendment at a meeting of the directors duly called and held; and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 26 thereof, the
parties desire to further amend the Rights Agreement as set forth in this
Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements set forth herein and in the Rights Agreement, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

         1. Each of the following sections of the Rights Agreement is hereby
amended such that each reference to twenty percent (20%) in such section shall
be changed to ten percent (10%):

         (a)      Section 1(a) of the Rights Agreement;

         (b)      Section 3(a) of the Rights Agreement;

         (c)      Section 11(a) of the Rights Agreement; and

         (d)      the third and seventh paragraphs of Exhibit B to the Rights
                  Agreement.

         2. The term "Agreement", as used in the Rights Agreement, shall be
deemed to refer to the Rights Agreement as amended hereby.

         3. Section 1(i) of the Rights Agreement is hereby replaced in its
entirety to read as follows:

                  "(i) "Exempt Person" shall mean:

                  (i) the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee
         benefit plan or employee stock plan of the Company or of any
         Subsidiary of the Company, or any person or entity organized,
         appointed, established or holding Company Common Stock for or
         pursuant to the terms of any such plan;

                  (ii) any Person who was, together with such Person's
         Affiliates and Associates, the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%)
         or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock on December
         27, 2004, provided that after the date of this Agreement such Person,
         together with such Person's Affiliates and Associates, does not (A)
         become the Beneficial Owner (other than through inadvertance and
         under circumstances where (i) such Person agrees to the divestiture
         of a number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary for such
         Person to be included within the definition of an Exempt Person or
         (ii) such Person's acquisition of additional shares of Company Common
         Stock is subsequently approved by the Board of Directors of the
         Company) of additional shares of Company Common Stock representing

         shall no longer be deemed to be an Exempt Person for purposes of this
         Agreement;

                  (iii) any Person who would otherwise become an Acquiring
         Person solely by virtue of a reduction in the number of outstanding
         shares of Company Common Stock; provided, however, that such Person
         shall not be an Exempt Person if, subsequent to such reduction, such
         Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of
         Company Common Stock; or

                  (iv) any Person who, together with such Person's Affiliates
         and Associates, has reported on Schedule 13G under the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or any comparable or successor
         report), Beneficial Ownership of shares of Company Common Stock

         outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, but less than fifteen

         Common Stock, provided that after the date of this Agreement such
         Person, together with such Person's Affiliates and Associates, does
         not become the Beneficial Owner (other than through inadvertence and
         under circumstances where (i) such Person agrees to the divestiture
         of a number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary for such
         Person to be included within the definition of an Exempt Person or
         (ii) such Person's acquisition of additional shares of Company Common
         Stock is subsequently approved by the Board of Directors of the
         Company) of shares of Company Common Stock representing, in the
         aggregate, fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then issued and
         outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, in which case such Person
         shall no longer be deemed to be an Exempt Person for purposes of this
         Agreement."

         4. (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that this Amendment is an
integral part of the Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of the
Rights Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any conflict between this
Amendment and the Rights Agreement or any part of either of them, the terms of
this Amendment shall control.

                  (b) Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms and
conditions of the Rights Agreement are and shall remain in full force and
effect and shall be otherwise unaffected hereby.

constitute one and the same document.

                       CALGON CARBON CORPORATION AMENDS
                            SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN


PITTSBURGH, PA - December 27, 2004 - Calgon Carbon Corporation (NYSE: CCC)
(the "Company") - announced today that its Board of Directors amended the
Company's Shareholder Rights Plan to reduce the triggering threshold under the
Plan to 10% from its previous level of 20%. As a result of the amendment and
subject to certain exceptions, the Rights will be triggered if a person or
group acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the Company's common
shares or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such
person or group would beneficially own 10% or more of the Company's common
shares. Current holders of 10% or more of the Company's common stock will not
trigger the Rights unless any such holder acquires an additional 1% of the
Company's common shares or, in the case of a holder that reports its
beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, such holder increases its ownership
above 15%.

The Rights, which were issued in connection with the adoption of the Plan in
1995, currently entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of
the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $50, subject to adjustment.
Upon the occurrence of certain triggering events - including the acquisition
of 10% or more of the Company's common stock, as described above - the Rights
will become exchangeable for shares of the Company's common stock or, in some
cases, the stock of an acquiror.

A copy of the amendment to the Company's Shareholder Rights Plan is being
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Calgon Carbon Corporation (NYSE: CCC), headquartered in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, is a global leader in services and solutions for making air and
water cleaner and safer. The company employs approximately 1,200 people at 18
operating facilities and 27 sales and service centers worldwide.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe harbor"
for forward-looking statements. This document contains certain statements that
are forward-looking relative to the Company's future strategy and performance.
They involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the
Company's actual results in future periods to be materially different from any
future performance.
