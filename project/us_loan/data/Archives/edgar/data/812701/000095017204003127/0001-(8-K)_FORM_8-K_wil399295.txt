Item 3.03 -Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.

         On December 27, 2004, Calgon Carbon Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to approval by the Company's Board of
Directors, entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement ("Amendment
No. 2") by and between the Company and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (as
successor to First Chicago Trust Company of New York), dated as of February 3,
1995, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated as of April 23, 1999 (as so
amended, the "Rights Agreement"). Amendment No. 2 reduces from 20% to 10% the
threshold at which the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) will be
triggered. According to the Rights Agreement as amended, subject to certain
exceptions described in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will be triggered
after a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the
Company's outstanding common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
upon consummation of which such person or group will become the beneficial
owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock. Current
holders of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock will not
trigger the Rights unless any such holder acquires an additional 1% of the
Company's common shares or, in the case of a holder that reports its
beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, such holder increases its ownership
above 15%. A copy of Amendment No. 2 is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

         On December 27, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing
the approval and implementation of Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement. A
copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated
herein by reference.
