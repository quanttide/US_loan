LL&E ROYALTY TRUST

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. - TRUSTEE                        NEWS
________________________________________________________ RELEASE _______________

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AUSTIN, TEXAS (December 23, 2004) -- LL&E Royalty Trust (NYSE SYMBOL-LRT)
announced today the Trust income distribution for the month of January 2005.
This distribution represents amounts payable to the Trust with respect to
production for the month of October 2004. Unit holders of record on January 5,
2005 will receive a distribution of $611,640 or approximately $.032206 per Unit
payable on January 14, 2005.

The distribution includes no proceeds from the Jay Field and South Pass 89
properties due to excess production costs. Excess production costs to be
recouped from future proceeds at the Jay Field and South Pass 89 properties
total $1,668,422 and $303,243 respectively.

The Working Interest Owner, under the terms of the Trust Conveyance, is
permitted to escrow funds up to 125% of the estimated future costs such as
dismantlement costs and capital expenditures for the properties in which the
Trust has an interest (Special Cost Escrow). According to the most recent
reserve report, estimated dismantlement costs are $13.3 million for Jay Field
property, $1.9 million for South Pass 89 property and $2.3 million for Offshore
Louisiana property. The Working Interest Owner has informed the Trustee that it
has elected not to escrow any additional funds at this time. However, the
Working Interest Owner intends to continue to monitor each of the properties in
which the Trust has an interest for possible changes in relevant factors, which
may warrant a need for additional escrow. To date, the amounts escrowed for
future dismantlement costs total approximately $4.5 million for Jay Field
property, $2.6 million for South Pass 89 property and $3 million for the
Offshore Louisiana property. The amounts escrowed on the South Pass 89 and
Offshore Louisiana properties exceed 125% of the estimated future dismantlement
costs by approximately $225,000 and $125,000 respectively. The Trust Conveyance
permits, but does not require, the Working Interest Owner to release the excess
escrowed funds, and the Working Interest Owner has informed the Trustee that it
does not intend to release any portion of the escrowed funds at this time.

Gross Proceeds prior to deductions for Production Costs for the month of October
2004 by property are as follows: $2,100,035 for Jay Field property, $120,808 for
South Pass 89 property, and $863,527 for Offshore Louisiana property.


Production Costs for the month of October 2004 by property are as follows:
$3,768,457 for Jay Field property, $424,051 for South Pass 89 property and
$159,710 for Offshore Louisiana property.

There was no deduction made for the Special Cost Escrow in October 2004. Fee
Lands Royalties for the month of October 2004 totaled $32,001. Trust related
expenses for the month of October 2004 totaled $53,795.

The Gross Proceeds, Production Costs and Special Cost Escrow numbers stated
above relate to each property as a whole. The Trust's interest in these
properties is 50% for Jay Field, 50% for South Pass 89 and 90% for Offshore
Louisiana.

The extent of future distributions from the properties in which the Trust has an
interest will continue to be dependent on normal factors associated with oil and
gas operations such as oil and gas production levels, prices and associated
cost, timing and extent of capital expenditures. In addition, the amount of
future distributions will depend on the amounts escrowed by the Working Interest
Owner as described above.

The Trust income distribution announcement for the month of February will be
made on or about January 28, 2005.
