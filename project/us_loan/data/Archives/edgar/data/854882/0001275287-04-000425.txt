            GREAT WESTERN LAND AND RECREATION NAMES JEROME JOSEPH CFO

    SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Great Western Land
and Recreation Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: GWES), a real estate development
company with urban and ranch land in various stages of development in the
Southwest, today announced that Jerome L. Joseph, 46, has been appointed
senior vice president and chief financial officer.

    Joseph had been chief financial officer for seven years at NZ Corporation,
a former American Stock Exchange company active in real estate development and
management, including single-family lots, recreational ranch properties,
minerals, and industrial buildings. Through its subsidiary, Bridge Financial
Corporation, NZ also was a commercial real estate lender specializing in
short-term bridge loans in most sectors of the real estate market.  Joseph
helped guide NZ through a reverse merger with Lipid Sciences, Inc., which is
traded on Nasdaq. He also has several years experience as a senior financial
executive with local and national homebuilders.

    "We expect Joe's extensive background as a financial executive in the real
estate industry to immediately begin benefiting Great Western Land and
Recreation as we move forward with our growth initiatives," said Jay N. Torok,
chairman and chief executive officer. "Of particular interest was his
experience in single-family homebuilding, an area to which we plan to expand
in addition to our core businesses of developing land for sale to homebuilders
and recreational users and building condominium projects."

    Great Western Land and Recreation Inc. is the product of a merger in
February 2003 between 1st Realty Investments Inc., a public company, and Great
Western, a real estate development company that was wholly owned by Amortibanc
Investments LC, one of Kansas' oldest mortgage and investment banking firms.
Great Western's activity is focused in two of the nation's fastest-growing
major metropolitan areas, Houston and Phoenix. It is also developing a major
ranch property in rural Arizona. Great Western's common stock is quoted on the
Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board under ticker symbol GWES. Additional
