ITEM 8.01      OTHER EVENTS

NEW YORK, NY, December 29, 2004 - Hollinger International Inc. (NYSE-HLR) said
that its outside auditor is conducting its final review of the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and it expects to file
the Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than
mid-January, 2005. The Company also expects to become current on its quarterly
reports for 2004 within approximately two months following the filing of its
2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company stated that it has been providing regular updates to the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) concerning its expected timetable regarding the filing of
its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports for 2004. The NYSE
had advised the Company that the Report needed to be filed by December 30, 2004,
in accordance with NYSE practices with respect to late Annual Report filers. The
NYSE may, in its discretion, grant the Company up to an additional three months
to file its 2003 Annual Report, which the Company has requested. In exercising
its discretion relating to the additional three-month period, the NYSE's
procedures provide that the NYSE would consider, among other things, the
likelihood of the 2003 Form 10-K being filed during such period as well as the
Company's financial status. If the extension is denied, the NYSE will commence
suspension and delisting procedures by a notice to the Company. In such case,
the Company would have the right to appeal to the NYSE Board. The Company
intends to appeal if the extension is not granted, in which case the trading on
the NYSE would not continue during the appeal period and the Company would seek
alternate arrangements.
