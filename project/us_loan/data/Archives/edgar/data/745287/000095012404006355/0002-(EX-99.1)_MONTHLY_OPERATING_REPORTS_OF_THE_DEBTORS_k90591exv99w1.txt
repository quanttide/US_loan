Note 1: The financial information contained in the operating statement and
balance sheet in the monthly operating statement for Intermet Corporation
represents the consolidation of all of its domestic subsidiaries that are
debtors, other than Intermet Holding Company. Intermet Holding Company is a
holding company of certain foreign subsidiaries and does not itself have any
domestic operations. As a result, Intermet Holding Company's results are
incorporated in the results of Intermet Corporation foreign subsidiaries.

Certain amounts in the previous operating statements have been reclassified to
conform to the presentation of November operating statements.

Note 2: The October 31, 2004 balance sheet includes a reclassification of $8.2
million "Accrued Income Taxes" related to foreign subsidiaries to "Long-Term
Intercompany Payables." This reclassification is the result of consolidation and
elimination of intercompany income tax transactions. There is no cash impact
relating to this reclassification.

*Note: Intermet Holding Company is a holding company of certain foreign foreign
subsidiaries and does not itself have any domestic operations. As a result,
Intermet Holding Company's results are incorporated in the results of Intermet
Corporation foreign subsidiaries. For November, $385,000 of Intercompany
interest was eliminated through foreign operations and therefore not included in
this statement.
