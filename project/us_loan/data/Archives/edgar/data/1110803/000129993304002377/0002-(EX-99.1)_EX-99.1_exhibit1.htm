MARKETING STRENGTHS FOR GLOBAL LIFE SCIENCES CUSTOMERS</B></FONT>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>Companies to Deliver Unequaled Value in Multiple Formats to the Worldwide Oligonucleotide Market</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">CARLSBAD, CA, and SAN DIEGO, CA, Dec. 20, 2004 &#150; Invitrogen Corporation (NASDAQ: IVGN) and
Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ: ILMN) today announced a strategic collaboration to leverage their
respective strengths in nucleic acid synthesis and distribution to deliver oligonucleotides of
unequaled value to the life sciences market worldwide. The collaboration will expand Illumina&#146;s
Oligator&#174; DNA synthesis technology and combine that capability with Invitrogen&#146;s extensive sales,
marketing and distribution channels. Oligonucleotides (oligos)&nbsp;are small, synthetic pieces of DNA
that are an essential component of all genetic research, and global researchers will benefit from
access to oligos with industry-leading quality and value available in both tube and plate formats,
as well as reliable order turnaround times.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Under the terms of the agreement, Invitrogen will invest $3.4&nbsp;million in Illumina&#146;s San Diego
facility to enable implementation of fourth-generation Oligator technology, extend the technology
into tube-based oligo products and provide for transfer of the technology into two additional
Invitrogen facilities outside North America. Over the next several quarters, the companies expect
to transition all responsibility for sales, marketing and technical support to Invitrogen as
Illumina builds its capability to manufacture tube-based oligos. Customers will experience a
seamless transition as current ordering processes and sales representatives will remain intact.
Profit from the collaboration products will be split equally between the two companies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">&#147;This agreement is a classic win-win for both companies,&#148; said Nicolas Barthelemy, Invitrogen
Senior Vice President, Operations. &#147;It enables our companies to implement manufacturing
efficiencies that can expand our current capacity to serve a larger customer base. With Illumina&#146;s
best-in-class Oligator synthesis technology, we&#146;ll be in a position to offer customers a more
competitive portfolio of plate-based products for large-volume genomics projects as well as
specialized tube-based products that will be synthesized and LIMS-controlled under the same SPC/SQC
(statistical process control/statistical quality control) standards as plates.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">&#147;The world oligo market is highly fragmented and underserved,&#148; Invitrogen Chairman and CEO, Gregory
T. Lucier added. &#147;We&#146;re confident that by joining forces, we can accelerate organic growth and
enhance our collective market share. This agreement brings two leading San Diego-based life
science companies together to help accelerate pharmaceutical research by improving the quality,
utility and availability of this essential element in the research process.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">&#147;This collaboration provides the opportunity to expand the reach of Oligator technology into
broader markets through Invitrogen&#146;s world-class sales and distribution pipeline,&#148; said Jay
Flatley, Illumina president and CEO. &#147;Oligos in tubes represent the largest market segment by far,
and we believe our combined synthesis and distribution capabilities will put our companies in a
strong position to capture many new customers throughout the worldwide research community. We
anticipate a seamless transition for our current oligo customers and expect that they will benefit
from working with Invitrogen&#146;s extensive global service network.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>About Oligonucleotides</B>
<BR>
Oligonucleotides, or oligos, are short, single-stranded lengths of synthetic DNA used very broadly
in genomics and drug discovery research to support applications that include DNA sequencing, SNP
genotyping, RNA profiling and PCR priming. Oligos are synthesized from biochemical building blocks
called nucleotides, which consist of four bases &#151; adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine. These
bases are synthesized in a programmed order designed to bind, or &#147;hybridize&#148; with a complementary
sequence in a prepared sample to enable replication and detection.
