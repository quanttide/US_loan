FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">SANTA MONICA, California &#151; Dec. 16, 2004 &#151; Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation (NYSE: ANH) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.27 per share for the
fourth quarter of 2004. The common stock dividend is payable on January 27, 2005 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2004. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Also, in accordance with the terms of the Company&#146;s 8.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors
declared the initial preferred stock dividend of $0.335417 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004. The preferred stock dividend is payable on January 18, 2005 to preferred stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2004.
The dividend reflects the accrual from November 5, 2004 through December 31, 2004, or 56 days of a 360 day year. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Commenting on Anworth&#146;s operations, Lloyd McAdams, Anworth&#146;s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, stated, &#147;With
this last 2004 common stock dividend declaration, the cumulative dividends for the year now equal $1.25 per share. Based on initial indications, we expect earnings per share for 2004 to be approximately equal to this amount. </FONT></P> <P

December quarter appears to be largely the result of reduced premium amortization. Specifically, agency premium amortization expense for the December quarter appears to be approximately $0.04 per share less than that of the September quarter. We
expect that the quarterly Premium Amortization Rate, the portion of previously unamortized premium expensed during the quarter, will be approximately 9%. This reduced amortization expense was, however, partially offset by the increase in interest
rates during the December quarter, as our cost of short-term financing rose by more than the increase in the interest rates earned on our assets.&#148; </FONT></P>
