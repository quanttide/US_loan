<div style="text-indent:6%"><p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics covers a wide range of business practices and procedures.  It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide employees, officers and trustees of the Company.  All of our employees, officers and trustees must conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. </font></p></div>
<div style="text-indent:6%"><p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">If a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law; however, if a local custom or policy conflicts with this Code, you must comply with the Code.  If you have any questions about these conflicts, you should ask your supervisor how to handle the situation. </font></p></div>
<div style="text-indent:6%">
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Those who violate the standards in
    this Code will be subject to disciplinary action which may include immediate
    termination. <b></b><i>If you are in a situation which you believe may violate
    or lead to a violation of this Code, follow the procedures described in Sections
    14-16 of this Code</i>. </font></p>

Although not all employees are expected to know the details of these laws, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors.</font></p></div>

<div style="text-indent:6%"><p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">A &#8220;conflict of interest&#8221; exists when a person&#8217;s private interest may or does interfere with the interests of the Company.  A conflict can arise when an employee, officer or trustee takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work objectively and effectively.  Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer or trustee, or member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company. </font></p></div>
<div style="text-indent:6%"><p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">It is almost always a conflict of interest for a Company employee to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer or supplier.  Employees are not allowed to work for a competitor as a consultant or board member.  The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with our competitors, customers or suppliers, except on our behalf.  Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except in circumstances approved by the Board of Trustees or the Audit Committee of the Board. </font></p></div>
<div style="text-indent:6%"><p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut, so if you have a question, you should consult with higher levels of management or the Company&#8217;s General Counsel.  Any employee, officer or trustee who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict should bring it to the attention of a supervisor or follow the procedures described in Section 13 of this Code. </font></p></div>
