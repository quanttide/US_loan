    AND MTF SIGN A SECOND PROCESSING AGREEMENT</font></p>
  <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;line-height: 150%;'><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p style=' margin-bottom:12pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;'><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">As
    previously announced in November 2004, Osteotech, Inc. had been informed by
    the American Red Cross Transplantation Services (&#147;ARC&#148;) and the
    Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (&#147;MTF&#148;) that ARC and MTF have
    entered into an agreement for MTF to acquire the assets related to ARC&#146;s
    allograft tissue banking operations and anticipate closing the asset acquisition
    sometime in January 2005. Also announced was that Osteotech and MTF had reached
    an agreement in principle for a second processing agreement. </font></p>
  <p style=' margin-bottom:6pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;'><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">On
    December 22, 2004, Osteotech and MTF signed a definitive agreement for a second
    processing agreement, which will be effective upon the closing of the ARC/MTF
    asset acquisition agreement. Pursuant to the second MTF processing agreement,
    MTF will provide Osteotech with a certain amount of standard donors for processing
    that is equivalent to the amount of standard donors required to be delivered
    by ARC to Osteotech under the existing processing agreement with ARC. The
    second MTF processing agreement has an initial term that expires in December
    2006, which, in certain circumstances, can be extended for two additional
    one-year periods. The terms and conditions of the original Osteotech and MTF
    processing agreement entered into in June 2002 and continuing through December
    2008 are not impacted by the second MTF processing agreement or the ARC/MTF
    asset acquisition agreement. Separately, and as a result of the pending transaction
    between ARC and MTF, Osteotech is holding discussions with ARC to negotiate
    the termination of its processing agreement with ARC. </font></p>
  <p style=' margin-bottom:6pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;'><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">In
    addition, Osteotech, ARC and MTF have negotiated and signed several arrangements
    establishing protocols and procedures to ensure a consistent number and flow
    of donors delivered to Osteotech during the period prior to the closing of
    the ARC/MTF asset acquisition transaction. Under these transition arrangements,
    MTF will deliver to Osteotech the types and quantities of donors required
    to be delivered by ARC under the existing ARC processing agreement, although
    such donors will be processed principally in accordance with the terms of
    the second MTF processing agreement. These arrangements will terminate upon
    the closing of the ARC/MTF asset acquisition transaction and the second processing
    agreement between Osteotech and MTF becoming effective. </font></p>

    statements made throughout this press release that are not historical facts
    contain forward-looking statements (as such are defined in the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the Company&#146;s future plans,
    objectives and expected performance. Any such forward-looking statements are
    based on assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but are subject
    to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and, therefore, there can be no
    assurance that actual results may not differ materially from those expressed
    or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual
    results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the failure
    of MTF&#146;s acquisition of ARC&#146;s allografts tissue banking assets to
    close and the resulting failure of Osteotech&#146;s new processing agreement
    with MTF to become effective, Osteotech&#146;s inability to satisfactorily
    resolve issues relating to the termination of the ARC processing agreement,
    differences in anticipated and actual product and service introduction dates,
    the ultimate success of those products in the market place, the continued
    acceptance and growth of current products and services, the impact of competitive
    products and services, the availability of sufficient quantities of suitable
    donated tissue and the success of cost control and margin improvement efforts.
    Certain of these factors are detailed from time to time in the Company&#146;s
    periodic reports (including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
    December 31, 2003 and the Form 10-Q for each of the first three quarters of
    2004) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All information in
    this press release is as of December 28, 2004 and the Company undertakes no
    duty to update this information. </font></p>
