Item 3.01. NOTICE OF DELISTING OR FAILURE TO SATISFY A CONTINUED LISTING RULE OR
           STANDARD; TRANSFER OF LISTING.

     In a letter from the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) dated December 23, 2004
     the Company was notified that a Listing Qualifications Panel had affirmed
     that its Common Stock would be delisted from the AMEX due to its financial
     condition and operating results. The delisting will be effective with the
     open of business on Monday January 3, 2004.

     Background:

     The Company received notification from the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX)
     on April 29, 2003 that it was not in compliance with certain listing
     standards relating to stockholders' equity and net losses. In June 2003 the
     Company submitted a plan to AMEX setting forth a plan for compliance with
     the AMEX continuing listing standards. On July 28, 2003, AMEX notified the
     Company that it had accepted the proposed plan and granted an extension
     until October 31, 2004 to regain compliance. During this time the Company's
     stock continued to trade on AMEX and the Company was subject to periodic
     review of its progress consistent with its plan. On November 10, 2004 the
     AMEX notified the Company that it was subject to delisting from the
     Exchange, as it was unable to regain compliance with the continuing listing
     standards by October 31, 2004. The Company is not in compliance with the
     following listing standards. (a) The Company has sustained losses in its
     five most recent fiscal years and has not maintained stockholders equity of
     at least $ 6 million. (b) The Company has sustained losses in three of its
     four most recent fiscal years and has not maintained shareholders equity of
     at least $4 million. (c) The Company has sustained losses in two of its
     most recent fiscal years and has not maintained stockholders equity of at
     least $ 2 million. The Company had negative stockholders equity of
     ($ 52,072.00) at September 30, 2004. The Company appealed this staff
     determination and requested a hearing before a committee of the Exchange.
     On December 21, 2004 the Company met with a Listing Qualifications Panel of
     the AMEX Committee on Securities to review the staff determination. In a
     letter dated December 23, 2004 the AMEX notified the Company that the
     Listing Qualifications Panel had affirmed the Staff's determination to
     delist the Common Stock of the Company. The delisting will be effective
     with the open of business Monday, January 3, 2004.


Item 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURES

     On December 28, 2004 the Company issued a press release announcing that its
     Common Stock would be delisted from the American Stock Exchange effective
     with the open of business Monday, January 3, 2004.
