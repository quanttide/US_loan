<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Item&nbsp;2.06 is incorporated here by reference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2.06. Material Impairments.</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;17, 2004, the company&#146;s management, in consultation with the company&#146;s Audit Committee,
determined to remove from service and make available for sale certain land and building in Nagoya,
Japan that relates to its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary Asyst Japan, Inc., or AJI. As a
result, the company expects to record an impairment charge in its third fiscal quarter in the range
of $4&nbsp;million to $5&nbsp;million, based on the company&#146;s most-recent assessment of fair market value.<BR>
The building has been underutilized since a prior decision to outsource manufacturing, and has
previously been partially written down.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The sale of the property is not expected, in and of itself, to result in any direct future cash
expenditure (other than associated transaction costs). However, the property comprising the land
and building collateralizes approximately $10&nbsp;million (at the exchange rate as of December&nbsp;17,
2004) of Japanese Yen-denominated debt held with a local bank. This debt is guaranteed by the
company and, in conjunction with the sale of the property, will likely need to be refinanced in
whole or in part.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The company estimates that the
 sale of the property will be effected in the next twelve months.
However, until a transaction is completed, the company cannot determine the actual proceeds of any
such sale, whether the Japanese Yen-denominated debt held with a local bank will, in fact, be
refinanced in whole or in part and what amount, if any, of associated cash out-lay will be required
by the company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer
of Listing.</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The company has appeared before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel on December&nbsp;15, 2004, to
discuss its filing delay relating to its Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter. The panel took
no action and the matter remains open. The company requested a filing extension until January&nbsp;14,
2005, and expects to file in advance of that date its Form 10-Q for the fiscal second quarter and,
as a result of the restatement determination discussed in Item&nbsp;4.02 below, a Form 10-Q/A for the
fiscal first quarter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or
Completed Interim Review.</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">(a)&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2004, the company&#146;s management, in consultation with the Audit Committee of
the company&#146;s Board of Directors, determined to restate the company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements for its fiscal first quarter ended June&nbsp;26, 2004, and determined that the financial
information for that period included in the company&#146;s Form 10-Q previously filed on August&nbsp;5, 2004,
and in any press releases prior to December&nbsp;20, 2004 which incorporate or reference such financial
information, should not be relied upon. Management and the company&#146;s Audit Committee also
discussed the matters described in this Item&nbsp;4.02 with the company&#146;s independent registered public
accounting firm.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The company was significantly delayed in reporting its fiscal second quarter results because Asyst
Shinko, Inc. (ASI), the company&#146;s 51%-owned joint venture company in Japan, was not able to close
its books in a timely manner. As previously announced, this was due to difficulties associated with
ASI&#146;s conversion to a new ERP information system and to a now-resolved customer contract dispute at
ASI. Closing ASI&#146;s books required substantial review and rebuilding of ASI&#146;s financial records for
the fiscal second quarter. This process also identified material accounting errors in ASI&#146;s fiscal
first quarter results,


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">which has led to the decision to restate those results. As part of the restatement, the company
also made adjustments to the fiscal first quarter results reported for ATI, its base business, to
reflect the deferral of certain new product-related revenue that had been previously recognized in
the quarter and amortization of deferred stock compensation.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The company believes that the ERP system conversion issues that led to inventory reconciliation
difficulties at ASI have been addressed and that the system will support the timely preparation and
submission of its consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The accounting errors at ASI primarily understated ASI&#146;s cost of goods sold for the fiscal first
quarter by $3.6&nbsp;million. Consolidated net loss on a GAAP basis for the fiscal first quarter will
be restated to $(2.3&nbsp;million), or $(0.05) per share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $(0.9
million), or $(0.02) per share, as originally reported.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The company anticipates filing its Form 10-Q/A to present the restated financial information for
the fiscal first quarter and Form 10-Q for the fiscal second quarter as soon as practicable.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The company has determined that the recent delay in closing ASI&#146;s books, the accounting errors that
led to the restatement of fiscal first quarter results, and the improper business practices at ASI
constitute material weaknesses in the company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. The
company is enhancing financial controls and procedures to strengthen timely review and analysis of
operations and financial results, and plans to increase the level of staffing in critical
functional areas, including cost accounting and internal audit at ASI.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Audit Committee of the company&#146;s board of directors has concluded its independent investigation
of the improper business practices at ASI that led to the recently resolved customer contract
dispute. The Audit Committee has approved management&#146;s remediation plan for ASI, which is to be
implemented over the next several quarters.
