FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


          ASYST TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS RESULTS FOR FISCAL SECOND QUARTER
               AND WILL RESTATE RESULTS FOR FISCAL FIRST QUARTER

FREMONT,  Calif., Dec. 20, 2004 - Asyst Technologies,  Inc., (Nasdaq NM: ASYTE),
today  announced  consolidated  financial  results for its fiscal second quarter
ended Sept.  25,  2004.  The company  also  announced  that it will be restating
consolidated  results for its fiscal first quarter ended June 26, 2004, and that
previously issued financial statements for the period should not be relied upon.
The  company  determined  to restate  its fiscal  first  quarter  results  after
identifying  material  accounting  errors  at  Asyst  Shinko,  Inc.  (ASI),  the
company's  51%-owned joint venture  company in Japan.  The primary effect of the
restatement  is to increase  the  company's  GAAP net loss for the fiscal  first
quarter by $1.4 million,  or $0.03 per share, over the originally  reported GAAP
net loss for the period.

         The company has appeared before a Nasdaq Listing  Qualifications  Panel
to discuss its filing  delay for its fiscal  second  quarter.  The panel took no
action and the matter  remains  open.  The company  anticipates  filing its Form
10-Q/A (as amended)  for the fiscal  first  quarter and Form 10-Q for the fiscal
second quarter as soon as practicable.

RESTATEMENT OF FISCAL FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
The company was  significantly  delayed in reporting its fiscal  second  quarter
results  because  ASI was not able to close  its  books in a timely  manner.  As
previously  announced,  this  was  due to  difficulties  associated  with  ASI's
conversion  to a new  ERP  information  system  and to a  now-resolved  customer
contract  dispute at ASI.  Closing ASI's books required  substantial  review and
rebuilding  of ASI's  financial  records  for the fiscal  second  quarter.  This
process also identified material accounting errors in ASI's fiscal first quarter
results,  which has led to the decision to restate those results. As part of the
restatement,  the company  also made  adjustments  to the fiscal  first  quarter
results reported for ATI, its base business,  to reflect the deferral of certain
new product-related  revenue that had been previously  recognized in the quarter
and amortization of deferred stock compensation.

         The company believes that the ERP system  conversion issues that led to
inventory  reconciliation  difficulties  at ASI have been addressed and that the
system will support the timely  preparation  and submission of its  consolidated
financial statements in future reporting periods.

         The accounting errors at ASI primarily  understated ASI's cost of goods
sold for the fiscal first  quarter by $3.6  million.  As restated,  gross margin
percentage  at ASI will be  reduced  to 5%,  which  compares  with the 10% gross
margin originally reported. On a consolidated basis, the restatement will reduce
gross  margin  for the  fiscal  first  quarter  to 21%,  compared  with  the 23%
originally reported.  Consolidated net loss on a GAAP basis for the fiscal first
quarter will be restated to $(2.3 million),  or $(0.05) per share, compared with
a GAAP net loss of $(0.9 million), or $(0.02) per share, as originally reported.
Pro forma net income for the fiscal first  quarter was reduced to $0.6  million,
or $0.01 per  share,  versus  the $2.1  million,  or $0.04 per share  originally
reported.  A table  reconciling  pro forma  operating  results to GAAP operating
results is provided as part of this release.

FISCAL SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
For the fiscal second quarter,  the company  reported  consolidated net sales of
$168.6 million,  up 21% from a restated  $139.4 million in the prior  sequential
quarter, and up 229% from $51.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. Sales of
tool and fab automation products at ATI, the company's base business, were $68.8
million,  down 4% from a restated $71.8 million in the prior sequential quarter.
Sales of automated  material  handling systems (AMHS) at ASI were $99.8 million,
up 47% from a restated $67.7 million reported in the prior sequential quarter.

         GAAP  consolidated  net loss for the fiscal  second  quarter  was $(1.8
million),  or $(0.04)  per share.  Pro forma net income for the quarter was $1.1
million, or $0.02 per share.

         Total net bookings in the quarter were $233.0  million,  compared  with
$108.1  million in the prior quarter.  ASI bookings of $174.0 million  increased
290% over the $44.6 million reported in the fiscal first quarter.  Fiscal second
quarter  bookings at ATI of $59.0 million were down 7% from $63.5 million in the
prior quarter.

         "ATI's  operational  performance in the fiscal second quarter again was
solid, as we delivered both high on-time  delivery  performance and gross margin
at the high end of our  guidance,"  said  Steve  Schwartz,  chairman  and CEO of
Asyst. "We had strong consolidated bookings for the quarter. ASI achieved record
bookings for its AMHS  products,  driven not only by a large flat panel  display
project  but  also  by   continuing   expansion  of  300mm   facilities  by  our
semiconductor  customers.  The  continued  robustness of our 300mm AMHS activity
reflects ASI's high standing in the industry,  the strength of our AMHS customer
base, and the clear industry shift to 300mm production."

ATI INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The company is pursuing initiatives at ATI to improve its financial performance.
At ATI, the company is focused on four core strategies:

- -    Increasing the penetration of new, high-value-added 300mm products for OEMs
     and chip  manufacturers,  including  the  Spartan(TM)  sorter,  the EIB(TM)
     family of advanced software products,  the IsoPort(TM) integrated loadport,
     and the Advantag(TM) and related automated identification systems.

- -    Continued manufacturing cost reduction through lower-cost sources of supply
     and streamlining of the supply chain infrastructure to realize more benefit
     from the company's outsourced manufacturing operations.

- -    Product  development  and marketing  alliances that leverage the breadth of
     the company's product lines and market position to bring complete,  bundled
     automation solutions to chip manufacturers.

- -    Operating expense  reductions,  including recently announced  restructuring
     activity.

MATERIAL WEAKNESS AND REMEDIATION
The company has  determined  that the recent delay in closing  ASI's books,  the
accounting  errors that led to the restatement of fiscal first quarter  results,
and the improper business practices at ASI constitute material weaknesses in the
company's  internal control over financial  reporting.  The company is enhancing
financial  controls and  procedures to strengthen  timely review and analysis of
operations and financial results, and plans to increase the level of staffing in
critical functional areas , including cost accounting and internal audit at ASI.

         The Audit  Committee of the company's  board of directors has concluded
its independent investigation of the improper business practices at ASI that led
to the recently  resolved  customer  contract  dispute.  The Audit Committee has
approved management's  remediation plan for ASI, which is to be implemented over
the next several quarters.

         Steve  Schwartz  said,  "ASI's sales in the fiscal second  quarter were
roughly  four  times  higher  than in the same  period  a year  ago.  While  the
organization has done an excellent job of achieving high levels of market share,
engineering  excellence,  quality,  and  customer  satisfaction,  the quality of
internal controls and the level of profitability  have been  unsatisfactory.  We
are moving forward with  initiatives that we believe will help ASI better manage
its growth and that are  absolutely  necessary to enhance the  transparency  and
predictability   of  the   business   and   accelerate   improvement   of  ASI's
profitability."

OUTLOOK
For the fiscal third  quarter  ending Dec. 25,  2004,  the company  provided the
following guidance:

- -    Net sales are expected to be in the range of $130 to $140 million.

- -    Including  all costs and  charges,  the  company  expects  to report a GAAP
     consolidated  net loss of $(15  million)  to $(18  million),  or $(0.30) to
     $(0.36) per share for the period.

- -    On a pro forma basis, the company expects to report a consolidated net loss
     of $(5  million)  to $(6  million),  or $(0.10) to  $(0.13)  per share.  To
     reconcile pro forma net loss to net loss under GAAP, the company expects to
     exclude:

     -    $6-7 million of  restructuring  charges,  which includes $2 million of
          severance  expenses related to action announced earlier this month and
          $4-$5 million  related to facility  consolidation.  The  restructuring
          activity is expected to provide $9-$10  million of annualized  savings
          in future quarters.

     -    $1.5 to $2.0 million of  accounting,  legal and other costs related to
          ASI's ERP and financial  close issues,  the company's  delinquent 10-Q
          filing and resulting Nasdaq listing  qualifications  process,  and the
          Audit Committee's independent investigation.

     -    Approximately  $2.5 million for  amortization of  intangibles,  net of
          tax,  and  approximately  $0.3  million for  stock-based  compensation
          expense related to prior acquisitions.

     -    The company is considering  additional facility consolidation over the
          next  several  quarters  that,  if  implemented,  would incur  related
          restructuring charges in future periods.

ABOUT OUR PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND ADJUSTMENTS
To supplement  our  consolidated  financial  results  prepared  under  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP"),  we use a pro forma  measure  of net
income that is GAAP net income adjusted to exclude  certain costs,  expenses and
gains. Our pro forma net income gives an indication of our baseline  performance
before gains,  losses or other  charges that are  considered by management to be
outside of our core  operating  results.  In  addition,  pro forma net income is
among  the  primary  indicators  management  uses as a basis  for  planning  and
forecasting  future  periods.  These measures are not in accordance  with, or an
alternative  for, GAAP and may be materially  different  from pro forma measures
used by other  companies.  We compute pro forma net income by adjusting GAAP net
income with the impact of  amortization of  acquisition-related  intangibles and
other  non-cash   charges  and  gains.   The  presentation  of  this  additional
information  should not be  considered  in isolation or as a substitute  for net
income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
