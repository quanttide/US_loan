<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>SANTARUS RECEIVES FDA APPROVAL FOR ZEGERID<BR>
POWDER FOR ORAL SUSPENSION 40MG</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt"><I>-First and Only Proton Pump Inhibitor Approved For<BR>
Reduction of Risk of Upper GI Bleeding in Critically Ill Patients -</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">SAN DIEGO, Calif., December&nbsp;22, 2004 &#150; Santarus, Inc. (Nasdaq:SNTS), a specialty pharmaceutical
company focused on therapies for gastrointestinal (GI)&nbsp;diseases and disorders, today announced that
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&nbsp;has approved the company&#146;s new drug application (NDA)
for ZEGERID<sup>&#153;</sup> (omeprazole)&nbsp;Powder for Oral Suspension 40mg, for the reduction of risk of
upper GI bleeding in critically ill patients and the short-term treatment (four to eight weeks) of
active benign gastric ulcers. ZEGERID is the first and only immediate-release oral proton pump
inhibitor (PPI)&nbsp;and is the only PPI approved for the indicated use in critically ill patients.
Santarus plans to commercially launch ZEGERID Powder for Oral Suspension 40mg in the first quarter
of 2005. This represents the second product approval for Santarus, following the launch of ZEGERID
Powder for Oral Suspension 20mg in October&nbsp;2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">&#147;With the approval of ZEGERID 40mg, we are now able to offer physicians and patients a higher
dosage that provides immediate release and strong and sustained acid control, with gastric pH above
4.0 for 18.6 hours per day with repeated once-daily dosing,&#148; said Gerald T. Proehl, president and
chief executive officer of Santarus. &#147;We believe ZEGERID 40mg presents an attractive opportunity
for Santarus in the over $12&nbsp;billion U.S. prescription PPI market, given that the vast majority of
prescriptions for currently marketed PPIs are filled at the highest dose strength available.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The company and its co-promotion partner, Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., are preparing their
combined approximately 400 person field sales force to promote ZEGERID 40mg to target physicians.
In connection with ZEGERID&#146;s approval for reduction of risk of upper GI bleeding in critically ill
patients, Santarus is also evaluating strategies to expand the promotion of ZEGERID to the hospital
market, including to the teaching and other influential institutions that serve this patient
population, in order to create greater awareness of the ZEGERID brand over time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>About ZEGERID</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">ZEGERID Powder for Oral Suspension, now approved in both 20mg and 40mg dose strengths, is an
immediate-release formulation of omeprazole that reaches peak plasma levels within approximately 30
minutes and provides strong acid control throughout the day. In addition to providing acid control
during the day, repeated once-daily dosing of ZEGERID 40mg prior to bedtime was found to provide
effective control of nighttime gastric acidity (median gastric pH of 4.1 for nighttime hours and
4.7 for a 24-hour period).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">ZEGERID&#146;s proprietary formulation utilizes an antacid to protect the omeprazole from acid
degradation in the stomach, allowing the omeprazole to be quickly absorbed into the blood stream.
All other marketed oral PPIs are delayed-release formulations that utilize an enteric coating to
protect the PPI from acid degradation, delaying absorption and initial acid suppression.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The approval of ZEGERID 40mg for the reduction of risk of upper GI bleeding in critically ill
patients and the short-term treatment of gastric ulcers adds to the broad range of indications for
which ZEGERID, in its other dosage strength, is approved. ZEGERID 20mg was approved earlier this
year for short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer, for heartburn and other symptoms associated
with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for the short-term treatment (four to eight weeks) of
erosive esophagitis which has been diagnosed by endoscopy and for maintenance of healing of erosive
esophagitis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Upper GI Bleeding in Critically Ill Patients &#150; Reducing the Risk</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">&#147;ZEGERID 40mg is the only PPI approved for the reduction of risk of upper GI bleeding in critically
ill patients&#148; said Bonnie Hepburn, M.D., senior vice president, drug development and chief medical
officer of Santarus. &#147;When evaluating ZEGERID 40mg for this indication, we were particularly
pleased to see such a significant reduction in gastric acidity in this patient population,
beginning with the first dose and continuing throughout the day.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Critically ill ventilated patients are at high risk for developing erosions and upper GI bleeding
that occur when the gastric mucosa, already compromised by stress, is continuously exposed to
significant amounts of acid. Many hospitals treat these patients prophylactically to reduce acid
and the risk of upper GI bleeding. Patients who develop upper GI bleeding may require blood
transfusions or in some cases may require surgery with a high mortality rate. It is estimated that
as many as four million critically ill patients are treated annually in the U.S., with 1.5&nbsp;million
at highest risk for upper GI bleeding due to the use of mechanical ventilators.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">To support approval of the upper GI bleeding indication, Santarus evaluated ZEGERID 40mg in a
double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. In the trial 178 critically ill patients
were treated with ZEGERID 40mg via nasogastric or orogastric tube, and only 4% of the patients
experienced clinically significant upper GI bleeding. Trial results also demonstrated that ZEGERID
provided significant reduction of gastric acid, with a median daily gastric pH above 4.0 in at
least 95% of the patients over the course of the 14-day trial, beginning with the first dose (99%
of patients 1-2.5 hours postdose and 92% of patients 6 hours postdose).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Important Safety Information</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">ZEGERID Powder for Oral Suspension 20mg is indicated for short-term treatment of active duodenal
ulcer, for heartburn and other symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for
the short-term treatment (four to eight weeks) of erosive esophagitis which has been diagnosed by
endoscopy, and for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. ZEGERID Powder for Oral
Suspension 40mg is indicated for the reduction of risk of upper GI bleeding in critically ill
patients and the short-term treatment (four to eight weeks) of active benign gastric ulcers.
ZEGERID is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of the
formulation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The most frequently reported adverse events with ZEGERID are headache, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Symptomatic response to therapy does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Atrophic
gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long term
with omeprazole.
<BR>
ZEGERID contains 460mg sodium per dose in the form of sodium bicarbonate, which should be taken
into consideration for patients on a sodium-restricted diet. Sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated
in patients with metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia.
