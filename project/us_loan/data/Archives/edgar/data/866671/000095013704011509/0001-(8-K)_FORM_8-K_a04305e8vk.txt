ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

         In a Current Report on Form 8-K, dated June 14, 2004, Western Water
Company (the "Company") reported that its application with the Colorado Office
of the State Engineer (the "SEO") for approval of a substitute water supply plan
relating to its Cherry Creek Project in Colorado was unexpectedly denied by the
SEO in April 2004.

         In a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2004, the Company reported that it and the Cottonwood Water & Sanitation
District ("Cottonwood") jointly submitted a new application for approval of a
substitute water supply plan on September 22, 2004 with the SEO. In the same
Quarterly Report, the Company noted that, based on its current estimates, unless
it is able to consummate sales of the water delivery contract units associated
with the Cherry Creek Project prior to approximately September 2005, or
otherwise generate additional cash, the Company will not be financially able to
sustain business operations thereafter.

         Limited Approval

         On December 23, 2004, the SEO rendered its decision ("the Decision") on
the new application for a substitute water supply plan filed on September 22,
2004. A copy of the letter describing the Decision is attached hereto as Exhibit
99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

         Although the Decision approves a modified substitute water supply plan,
it permits water deliveries only under certain conditions. The Company's
application for a substitute water supply plan, on the other hand, sought
approval for water deliveries under all physical conditions on Cherry Creek. The
Decision restricts delivery operations under the plan to periods when Cherry
Creek exhibits surface flow between the Company's delivery facilities (upstream)
and Cottonwood's production facilities (downstream). Because Cherry Creek
exhibits periodic and unpredictable dry spots in this reach of the Creek, the
Decision's restriction to periods of live stream conditions seriously limits the
value and utility of the substitute water supply plan. As a practical matter,
the live stream condition undercuts the actual and perceived reliability of
water deliveries, via Cherry Creek, from the Company's Cherry Creek Project to
any downstream customer.

         In light of the Decision, the Company now believes that it will be
unable to sell Cherry Creek Project water delivery contract units during the
current fiscal year because the Company cannot assure the prospective purchasers
of such units that they will be able to get water deliveries under all
conditions.

         The Company and Cottonwood are evaluating potential responses to the
Decision. Under Colorado law, the Decision could be appealed to the Division 1
Water Court within thirty days. Alternatively or in addition, the Company could
seek approval of a plan of augmentation through the Water Court, or the Company
and its customers could abandon plans for delivery via Cherry Creek and pursue
pipeline delivery. However, the Company does not have the financial resources
required to construct a delivery pipeline connecting its water production
facilities with its prospective customers' delivery systems, and the time
required to design, permit and construct


                                       2
<PAGE>
such a pipeline is beyond the Company's current planning horizon through
September 30, 2005, after which time the Company will not be financially able to
sustain its business operations, unless the Company is able to generate
additional cash. In light of the Decision, the Company also plans to consider
the outright sale of the Cherry Creek Project. However, there are no assurances
that a sale of the Cherry Creek Project could be arranged in a timely manner and
pursuant to economic terms favorable to the Company.

         Unless Western Water Company is able to assure potential customers of
reliable delivery of water under all physical conditions -- through an
acceptable substitute water supply plan, an augmentation plan or other means --
the Company does not expect to be able to monetize the Cherry Creek Project's
full value within the Company's current planning horizon through September 30,
2005.

         As previously reported, the Company's 9% Unsecured Subordinated
Debentures in the amount of approximately $8.8 million are due and payable on
September 30, 2005. The Company had planned to pay the Debentures from the
proceeds of monetization of the Cherry Creek Project. In light of the Decision,
the Company's ability to pay the Debentures when due is materially adversely
affected.
