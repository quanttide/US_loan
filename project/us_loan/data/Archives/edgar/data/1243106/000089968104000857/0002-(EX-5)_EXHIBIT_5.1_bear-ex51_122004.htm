<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to act as counsel for Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II Inc. (the
&quot;Company&quot;), in connection with the authorization and issuance from
time to time of Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates issuable in series (the
&quot;Certificates&quot;) and/or Mortgage-Backed Notes issuable in series (the
&quot;Notes&quot; and, together with the Certificates, the
&quot;Securities&quot;). A Registration Statement on Form S-3 relating to the
Securities (the &quot;Registration Statement&quot;) has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
As set forth in the Registration Statement, the Securities will be issued from
time to time in series (each, a &quot;Series&quot;) by separate trusts (each, a
&quot;Trust Fund&quot;) established by the Company. The Certificates of each
Series will be issued pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement
(each, a &quot;Pooling and Servicing Agreement&quot;) between the Company and an
independent trustee, or if Notes of a Series are issued, the Notes will be
issued under an indenture (each, an &quot;Indenture&quot;) between the Trust
Fund and an independent trustee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have examined original or reproduced or certified copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Company, records of actions taken by the
Company's Board of Directors, a form of Pooling and Servicing Agreement, a form
of Indenture, forms of Certificates, forms of Notes and each prospectus
supplement (each, a &quot;Prospectus Supplement&quot;) to the prospectus
(collectively with each Prospectus Supplement, the &quot;Prospectus&quot;)
forming a part of the Registration Statement and the other agreements and
documents filed as exhibits thereto. We also have examined such other documents,
papers, statutes and authorities as we deem necessary as a basis for the
opinions hereinafter set forth. In our examination of such material, we have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to original
documents of all copies submitted to us as certified or reproduced copies. We
have also assumed for purposes of the opinion given in paragraph 2 below that
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the Indenture, as the case may be, with
respect to any given Series as to which we act as counsel to the Company as
provided in the related Prospectus Supplement, has been duly and validly
authorized, executed and delivered by all parties thereto other than the Company
or, in the case of the Indenture, other than the respective Trust Fund. As to
various matters material to such opinions, we have relied upon the
representations and warranties in each of the form of Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the form of Indenture and statements and certificates of officers
and representatives of the Company and others. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Pooling and Servicing Agreement has been
duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company with respect
to a Series as to which we act as counsel to the Company, it will constitute a
legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms. When an Indenture has been duly and
validly authorized, executed and delivered by the respective Trust Fund with
respect to a Series as to which we act as counsel for the Company, it will
constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of such Trust Fund enforceable
against such Trust Fund in accordance with its terms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Securities of a Series issued pursuant to a
Pooling and Servicing Agreement or an Indenture with respect to which we act as
counsel for the Company have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the Company or, in the case of Notes, on the part of the
Trust Fund, and when executed as specified in, and delivered pursuant to, such
respective agreement and when sold as described in the Registration Statement,
they will be validly issued and outstanding and entitled to the benefits of such
respective agreement and, in the case of Certificates, will evidence the entire
beneficial ownership of the applicable Trust Fund and, in the case of Notes,
will be binding obligations of the Trust Fund.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements set forth in the Prospectus under
the heading "Federal Income Tax Consequences," to the extent that they
constitute matters of law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, are correct
in all material respects and are hereby adopted and confirmed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
rendering the foregoing opinions, we express no opinion as to laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the Federal law of the United
States of America. Our opinions expressed in paragraphs 1 and 2 are subject to
the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and
court decisions with respect thereto, and we express no opinion with respect to
the application of equitable principles in any proceeding, whether at law or in
equity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
hereby consent to the filing of this opinion for incorporation by reference into
the Registration Statement, to the reference to us in each Prospectus Supplement
as to which we act as counsel to the Company and to the filing of this opinion
as an exhibit to any application made by or on behalf of the Company or any
dealer in connection with the registration of the Certificates or the Notes with
respect to a Series as to which we act as counsel for the Company under the
securities or blue sky laws of any state or jurisdiction. In giving such
permission, we do not admit hereby that we come within the category of persons
whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 or the
General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder. </FONT></P>
