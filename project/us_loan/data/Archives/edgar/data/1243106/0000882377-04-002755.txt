Item 8.01.        Other Events.
                  ------------

         On or about December 30, 2004, the Registrant will cause the issuance
and sale of approximately $1,092,425,150 initial principal amount of Bear
Stearns ARM Trust 2004-12 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-12
(the "Certificates") pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to be dated
as of December 1, 2004, among the Registrant as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. as master servicer and securities administrator, EMC Mortgage Corporation,
as seller, and company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.

         In connection with the sale of the Series 2004-12, Class I-A-I, Class
I-X-1, Class II-A-1, Class II-X-1, Class II-A-2, Class II-X-2, Class II-A-3,
Class II-X-3, Class III-A-1, Class IV-A-1, Class R-1, Class R-2, Class R-3,
Class M-1, Class B-1, Class B-2, Class B-3 and Class B-4 Certificates (together
the "Underwritten Certificates"), the Registrant has been advised by Bear,
Stearns & Co. Inc. (the "Underwriter"), that the Underwriter has furnished to
prospective investors certain computational materials (the "Computational
Materials") with respect to the Underwritten Certificates following the
effective date of Registration Statement No. 333-106323, which Computational
Materials are being filed as exhibits to this report,

         The Computational Materials have been provided by the Underwriter. The
information in the Computational Materials is preliminary and may be superseded
by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Certificates and by any other
information subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The Computational Materials were prepared by the Underwriter at the
request of certain prospective investors, based on assumptions provided by, and
satisfying the special requirements of, such prospective investors. The
Computational Materials may be based on assumptions that differ from the
assumptions set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. The Computational Materials
may not include, and do not purport to include, information based on assumptions
representing a complete set of possible scenarios. Accordingly, the
Computational Materials may not be relevant to or appropriate for investors
other than those specifically requesting them.

         In addition, the actual characteristics and performance of the mortgage
loans underlying the Underwritten Certificates (the "Mortgage Loans") may differ
from the assumptions used in the Computational Materials, which are hypothetical
in nature and which were provided to certain investors only to give a general
sense of how the yield, average life, duration, expected maturity, interest rate
sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of the Underwritten Certificates might
vary under varying prepayment and other scenarios. Any difference between such
assumptions and the actual characteristics and performance of the Mortgage Loans
will affect the actual yield, average life, duration, expected maturity,
interest rate sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of the Underwritten
Certificates.
