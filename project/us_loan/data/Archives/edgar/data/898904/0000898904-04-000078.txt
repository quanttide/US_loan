Item 1.01         Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     On December 23, 2004,  ATA Holdings  Corp.  (the  "Company")  and Southwest
Airlines  Co.  ("Southwest")  executed  a document  entitled  "Bid  Proposal  to
Purchase  From,  Provide a DIP Facility and Exit Facility to, and Codeshare with
ATA  Holdings  Corp."  which  was  dated  as of  December  22,  2004  (the  "Bid
Proposal"),  by which Southwest agreed to acquire assets and assume  liabilities
relating to the  operations of the  Company's  subsidiary,  ATA  Airlines,  Inc.
("ATA"),  at Chicago Midway Airport  ("Midway"),  specifically  ATA's  leasehold
interest  in six  specified  gates and a hangar  facility  at Midway and related
assets (the "Midway Assets").  The Company and ATA (the "Debtors") are currently
operating as  debtors-in-possession in Chapter 11 cases pending in Indianapolis.
The Bid Proposal was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on December 21, 2004.

     Pursuant to the Bid Proposal,  on December 23, 2004 the parties executed an
Asset Purchase  Agreement dated as of December 22, 2004 (the "Asset  Agreement")
by which Southwest agreed to purchase from the Debtors the Midway Assets for $40
million, subject to certain adjustments. The completion of the asset purchase is
subject to various conditions, including, without limitation, the consent of the
City of Chicago to the assignment and transfer of the Midway Assets.

     Pursuant  to the Asset  Agreement,  on December  23,  2004,  Southwest  and
Debtors entered into the Southwest-ATA  Codeshare Agreement dated as of December
22, 2004 (the "Codeshare Agreement") relating to air transportation  services to
and from Midway (to begin on or about February 1, 2005) and additional  airports
in the future.  The initial term of the Codeshare  Agreement is one year,  which
will be automatically converted into an eight-year term (seven additional years)
if a plan of  reorganization  in the  Debtors'  Chapter  11 cases  (the "Plan of
Reorganization") is confirmed.

     Under the Bid Proposal,  Southwest  also  committed to providing ATA with a
debtor-in-possession  loan facility of up to $47 million. As required by the Bid
Proposal,  on  December  23,  2004,  ATA and  Southwest  entered  into a Secured
Debtor-in-Possession Credit and Security Agreement dated as of December 22, 2004
(the "DIP  Facility")  that  provides  up to $40  million  in cash to ATA plus a
guaranty  (the "Chicago  Guaranty")  by Southwest of up to $7 million.  The base
interest rate on amounts  borrowed  under the DIP Facility is the greater of (a)
8.0% per annum,  and (b) the  3-month  LIBOR  rate,  plus 5.0% per  annum,  paid
monthly.  During  the term of the DIP  Facility,  ATA will be subject to certain
financial covenants. The DIP Facility is guaranteed by the Company and its other
subsidiaries.  The  DIP  Facility  will  terminate  on the  earlier  of (i)  the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization and (ii) September 30, 2005, unless
otherwise extended.

     Under the Bid Proposal,  Southwest  also  committed to provide an exit loan
facility  (the  "Exit  Facility"  and  together  with  the  DIP  Facility,   the
"Facilities")  to the reorganized  Company ("New ATA") of up to $47 million upon
the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. The Exit Facility will provide
for (a) long-term  financing,  at a base  interest rate of 9.5% per annum,  paid
semi-annually,  consisting of one or more five-year notes to refinance up to $40
million under the DIP Facility, and (b) a replacement guaranty (the "Replacement
Chicago  Guaranty")  for up to $7 million  for the  Chicago  Guaranty.  The Exit
Facility is to be guaranteed by all of the debtor affiliates and subsidiaries of
New ATA.

     Under  the  Bid  Proposal,   upon  the  effective   date  of  the  Plan  of
Reorganization,  Southwest  committed to purchase,  through an  additional  cash
investment of $30 million, non-voting senior convertible preferred equity of New
ATA (the  "Preferred  Equity").  The Preferred  Equity will be convertible  into
27.5% of the fully diluted  economic  ownership  interest of New ATA, subject to
pro rata dilution for management  interests.  The Preferred Equity will (a) have
voting rights only upon certain  events of default,  (b) be senior to the common
equity of New ATA,  and (c) be  convertible  into  common  equity of New ATA, at
Southwest's option, upon Southwest's sale or transfer of the Preferred Equity to
a third party or certain other specified major  liquidity  events.  In addition,
the Preferred  Equity will earn dividends at the rate of 4.0% per annum and have
certain rights to require  registration for resale under the securities laws. If
not  converted  within  10  years  after  the  effective  date  of the  Plan  of
Reorganization,  the  Preferred  Equity shall,  at  Southwest's  option,  either
convert into common equity of New ATA or be redeemed.

     Southwest  will  receive a closing fee of 2.5% for each of the DIP Facility
and the  investment  in the  Preferred  Equity.  Southwest  will also receive an
unused commitment fee of 1.0% per annum, paid monthly, for any amounts not drawn
pursuant to the DIP Facility (excluding the Chicago Guaranty) and a guaranty fee
of 3.0% per annum, paid monthly,  for any amounts guaranteed but not drawn under
each of the Chicago Guaranty and the Replacement Chicago Guaranty. Southwest may
opt to satisfy  all or a portion of its  commitments  under the Bid  Proposal to
provide the Facilities by arranging for third-party financing.

     The  assignment  of ATA's  leasehold  interest  in the six  gates at Midway
closed on  December  23,  2004.  The  closing of the DIP  Facility  occurred  on
December 23, 2004. The purchase of ATA's leasehold interest in the Midway hangar
facility is expected to close on or about  January 12, 2005.  The Exit  Facility
will be  closed  and the  Preferred  Equity  will be  purchased  on or about the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. However, the Bid Proposal provides
that Southwest will not be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Plan of Reorganization if the Bankruptcy Court has not confirmed the Plan
of Reorganization on or before September 30, 2005.

     Other than the  relationships  contemplated by the Bid Proposal,  the Asset
Agreement, the Codeshare Agreement, the DIP Facility or the Exit Facility, there
are no other material relationships between Southwest and the Debtors.

     Certain of the  information  contained in this report  should be considered
"forward-looking  statements"  within  the  meaning  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 that  reflect the  Company's  current  views with
respect to certain  current and future  events and financial  performance.  Such
forward-looking  statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many
risks,  uncertainties  and factors  relating  to the  Company's  operations  and
business  environments  which may cause the actual  results of the Company to be
materially  different  from any  future  results  expressed  or  implied in such
forward-looking  statements.  Factors that could cause actual  results to differ
materially from these  forward-looking  statements include,  but are not limited
to, the  following:  the ability of the Company to continue as a going  concern;
the ability of the Company to develop, prosecute,  confirm and consummate one or
more  plans of  reorganization  with  respect  to the  Chapter  11  case;  risks
associated with third parties seeking and obtaining bankruptcy court approval to
terminate  or shorten  the  exclusivity  period for the  Company to propose  and
confirm one or more plans of reorganization, for the appointment of a Chapter 11
trustee or to convert  the case to a Chapter 7 case;  the ability of the Company
to obtain and  maintain  normal terms with  vendors and service  providers;  the
Company's ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations; the
potential  adverse  impact of the Chapter 11 case on the Company's  liquidity or
results of  operations;  the  ability of the  Company  to fund and  execute  its
business  plan  and to  attract,  motivate  and/or  retain  key  executives  and
associates;  the ability of the Company to attract and retain customers;  demand
for  transportation  in the  markets in which the  companies  operate;  economic
conditions;  the effects of any hostilities or act of war; labor costs; aviation
fuel costs;  competitive  pressures  on pricing  (particularly  from  lower-cost
competitors);  weather conditions;  government  legislation and regulation;  and
other  risks  and  uncertainties  set forth  from time to time in the  Company's
reports to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Similarly,   these  and  other   factors,   including   the  terms  of  any
reorganization plan ultimately confirmed,  can affect the value of the Company's
various pre-petition  liabilities,  common stock and/or other equity securities.
No  assurance  can be given as to what values,  if any,  will be ascribed in the
bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,  and it is possible that
the Company will be restructured in a manner that will  substantially  reduce or
eliminate  any  remaining  value.  Accordingly,   the  Company  urges  that  the
appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments
in any of these liabilities and/or securities.
