<P></A></A>Section 5.2 <U>Indemnity</U>.</P><DIR>


<DIR>





<P>(a) In the event it shall be determined that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to the terms of this Plan (a &quot;Payment&quot;) would subject a Participant to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;), or any interest or penalties are incurred by a Participant with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &quot;Excise Tax&quot;), then such Participant shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a &quot;Gross-Up Payment&quot;) in an amount such that after payment by such Participant of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, such Participant retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equa
l to the Excise Tax imposed upon the payments.</P>


<P>(b) Subject to the provisions of the next paragraph, all determinations required to be made under this Plan, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a certified public accounting firm designated by the Committee (the &quot;Accounting Firm&quot;) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Participant that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Plan, shall be paid by the Company to the Participant within five days of the later of (i)&nbsp;the due date for the payment of any Excise Tax, and (ii) the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Fi
rm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (&quot;Underpayment&quot;), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to the next paragraph and the Participant thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant.</P>


<P>(c) As a condition to indemnification hereunder, each Participant must notify the Company in writing of any claim by the IRS that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment and comply with the rules in this paragraph (c) and in paragraph (d).  Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but not later than ten business days after the Participant is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Participant gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).  If the Company notifies the Participant in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Participant must: (i)&nbsp;give the Company any information reasona
bly requested by the Company relating to such claim, (ii)&nbsp;take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting representation with respect to such claim by an attorney or accountant reasonably selected by the Company, (iii)&nbsp;cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and (iv)&nbsp;permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; <I>provided, however,</I> that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses.  Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the 
Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Participant to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Participant must prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; <I>provided, however,</I> that if the Company directs the Participant to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Participant, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or w
ith respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Participant with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the IRS or any other taxing authority.</P>


<P>(d) If, after the receipt by the Participant of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to this letter agreement, the Participant becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Participant must (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of the preceding paragraph) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).  If, after the receipt by the Participant of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to the preceding paragraph, a determination is made that the Participant shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Participant in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required
 to be paid.</P></DIR>
