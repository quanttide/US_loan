The reduction shall be in an amount so that the present value of the total amount received by the Participant from a Member Company will be One Dollar ($1.00) less than three (3) times the Participant's base amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of the amounts received by the Participant shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) <U>Determination of Reduction</U>.  The determination as to whether any reduction in the Severance Benefit is necessary shall be made by the Participant's Member Company in good faith, and the determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Participant.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) <U>Repayment of Excess Amount</U>.  If through error or otherwise the Participant should receive payments under this Plan, together with other payments the Participant has the right to receive from a Member Company, excluding Deferred Compensation Plan payments in excess of one dollar ($1.00) less than three times his base amount, the Participant shall immediately repay the excess to the Member Company upon notification that an overpayment has been made.</P></DIR>
