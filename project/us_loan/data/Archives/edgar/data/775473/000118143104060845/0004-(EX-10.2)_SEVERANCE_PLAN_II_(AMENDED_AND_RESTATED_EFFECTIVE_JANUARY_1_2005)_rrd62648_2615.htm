At the conclusion of the Continuation Period, the Participant shall be responsible for the entire payment of premiums required under COBRA for the duration of the COBRA continuation period.  
For purposes of this Section 5.5, applicable premiums that will be paid by the Member Company during the Continuation Period shall not include any amounts payable by the Participant under a Section 125 health care reimbursement plan, which amounts, if any, are the sole responsibility of the Participant.</P>
