    FRIEDMAN'S COMMENTS ON CIVIL ACTIONS FILED BY STATES' ATTORNEYS GENERAL


SAVANNAH, GA (December 22, 2004) - Friedman's Inc. (OTC non-BB: FRDM.PK), the
Value Leader in fine jewelry retailing, today said that it has received copies
of civil lawsuits that have been filed in state courts against the Company by
the attorneys general of three states where Friedman's does business. The
lawsuits, filed in Texas, Tennessee and Florida, each focus upon the manner in
which credit insurance has been sold, allege that some Friedman's customers
may not have realized they were purchasing credit insurance when buying
merchandise on credit issued by Friedman's or were told that credit insurance
was mandatory, and allege that consumer protection and insurance statutes or
regulations were violated. Sales for cash or paid for by credit or debit cards
are not at issue.

In response to the allegations, Friedman's stated that the Company does not
condone any improper practices alleged in the complaints. Friedman's further
noted that the Company believes that the transactions challenged primarily
arose years ago and stated that the Company has in place measures designed to
monitor and assure compliance with Company policy concerning credit insurance
sales practices.

As previously disclosed, Friedman's has been in discussions with attorneys
general from several states about credit insurance sales practices and other
matters. Friedman's stated that similar actions may be filed by attorneys
general in other states.
