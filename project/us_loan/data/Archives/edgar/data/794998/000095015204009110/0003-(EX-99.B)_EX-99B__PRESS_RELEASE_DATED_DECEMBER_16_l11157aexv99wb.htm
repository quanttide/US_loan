<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SETO Holdings, Inc. Receives Notice of Default under<BR>
Slamdance Media Group Funding Agreement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y. , December&nbsp;16, 2004 &#151; SETO Holdings, Inc. (OTCBB-SETO.OB) said that it
received a letter from counsel to Slamdance Media Group LLC claiming that SETO had breached the
provisions of a July&nbsp;5, 2004 agreement requiring SETO to pay an aggregate of $150,000 to Slamdance
at the rate of $50,000 on each of October&nbsp;15, November&nbsp;15 and December&nbsp;15, 2004 (the fourth and
final $50,000 installment being due on January&nbsp;15, 2005). Slamdance also stated that under the
agreement SETO&#146;s ownership interest in Slamdance does not vest at all unless and until SETO pays in
full its $500,000 investment obligation, of which SETO has paid $300,000 to date; therefore
Slamdance maintains that SETO currently has no ownership interest in Slamdance. SETO, which
currently does not have the ability to make any such payments due to the recent reduction of its
line of credit, believes it was legally justified in not making these payments, and SETO intends to
vigorously defend itself.
