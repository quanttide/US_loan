<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SETO HOLDINGS FILES FORM 15 WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE<BR>
COMMISSION TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION SUSPENDING ITS DUTY<BR>
TO FILE REPORTS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE<BR>
COMMISSION AND TO DEREGISTER ITS COMMON STOCK</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Briarcliff Manor, New York, December&nbsp;21, 2004 &#151; SETO Holdings, Inc. (SETO.BB) reported that it had
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Form&nbsp;15 notice of suspension of its duty to
file reports and termination of the registration of its Common Stock under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The Company expects the termination of registration to become effective within 90
days of the Form&nbsp;15 filing with the SEC. However, as a result of the Form&nbsp;15 filing, the Company&#146;s
obligation to file with the SEC certain reports and forms, including Forms10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, have
currently ceased. On or about December&nbsp;22, 2004, the Company&#146;s Common Stock will be delisted from
and will no longer trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. The Company expects that its Common Stock will
trade through the Pink Sheets&#174;, where currently there are 11 brokers listed as market makers,
although no assurance can be given that any broker will continue to make a market in the stock.
The &#147;Pink Sheets&#148; is a centralized quotation service that collects and publishes market maker
quotes in real time, primarily through its website, www.pinksheets.com, which provides stock and
bond price quotes, financial news and information about securities traded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Eugene J. Pian, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, said that given the lack of analyst coverage
and the minimal liquidity for the Company&#146;s Common Stock, the advantages of continuing as a
reporting company are far outweighed by the disadvantages, particularly the legal and accounting
costs associated with the preparation and filing of the Company&#146;s periodic reports and compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the relating regulations. Deregistration will result in a
significant reduction in legal and accounting expenses, and the Company will reallocate these
moneys to its operations. The Company and its shareholders will be better off over the long run as
Management focuses its attention and the Company&#146;s limited financial resources on the Company&#146;s
business, said Mr.&nbsp;Pian.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this news release are
forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements These uncertainties
include actions by the SEC concerning the Company&#146;s Form&nbsp;15 filing.
