ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION
          OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.

     On December 21, 2004, registrant received a letter dated December 17,
2004, from director Jon W. Rotenstreich in which Mr. Rotenstreich
communicated his resignation as a director to be effective January 1, 2005.


ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS;
          CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR.

     Effective as of December 16, 2004, the registrant's board of directors
amended Article III, Section 10(A) of the bylaws.

     Article III, Section 10(A) is a special, temporary provision relating
to the size and composition of the board of directors applicable during the
period from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2007.  The provision was adopted
pursuant to the merger agreement dated January 22, 2004, which governed the
combination of Union Planters Corporation and former Regions Financial
Corporation.

     Prior to this amendment, Section 10(A) generally provided that for the
period of three years following the merger, the board of directors will consist
of 26 members.

     This amendment applies to the period from the annual meeting in 2005
through June 30, 2007.  For such period, it removes the requirement that the
board of directors consist of 26 members, and provides instead that the number
of directors shall be fixed, from time to time, by resolutions adopted by the
board of directors, and shall not be less than three persons.  This amendment
also clarifies that after June 30, 2007, Article III, Section 10 of the bylaws
shall have no further force or effect.
