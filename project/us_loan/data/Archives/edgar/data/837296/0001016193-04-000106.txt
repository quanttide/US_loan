                               2232 Eastwood Blvd.

                              LETTER TO SUBSCRIBERS

                                December 27, 2004

Dear Subscriber:

     As a purchaser of Units in the Company's public offering,  you acquired one
share of common stock, one Class "A" Common Stock Purchase Warrant and one Class
"B" Common Stock  Purchase  Warrant.  The Warrants have been extended on several
occasions and effective  December 20, 2004, the Board of Directors  extended the
exercise  period of both the Class "A" and Class "B"  Warrants to  December  31,
2005.

     The Warrants are not  exercisable  until the Company  finds an  acquisition
target,  files with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  a  post-effective
amendment  to  this  registration  statement  and  offers  all  shareholders  an
opportunity to rescind their investment in the Company.

     The Company is continuing to seek suitable acquisition candidates and hopes
to be able to select a suitable  acquisition  candidate  within the  foreseeable
future. We appreciate your continued support.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors
