ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 23, 2004 following the rescission of consulting  agreements with Mr.
Malcolm  E. Taub and Mr.  Ernest  Muller  dated  August  10,  2004,  as  further
described in Item 1.02 of this report, we entered into new consulting agreements
with each of Messrs.  Taub and Muller.  The new agreements have a term of twelve
months from August 10, 2004 (the date of the original  agreements).  Pursuant to
the new agreements,  in consideration for the services  performed,  Mr. Taub and
Mr. Muller were issued,  respectively,  warrants to purchase up to 1,350,000 and
450,000  shares of our Common Stock at a per share  exercise  price of par value
($0.00005  per share).  These  warrants  are fully  vested on the date of grant,
exercisable for a period of 10 years from such date and are non-transferable.  A
copy of the new agreements and the warrants are attached  hereto,  respectively,
as Exhibits 10.07 and 10.08, and 4.05 and 4.06.

ITEM 1.02. TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

In August 10, 2004, we had entered into  consulting  agreements with Mr. Malcolm
E. Taub and Mr. Ernest Muller  pursuant to which they were issued  1,350,000 and
450,000 shares of our Common Stock  respectively (the "Shares") as consideration
for the services performed.  Due to a discrepancy regarding the valuation of the
Shares, on December 23, 2004 the parties  rescinded the original  agreements and
entered  into new  agreements  as set  forth  in Item  1.01 of this  report.  In
connection  with the  rescission  of the original  agreements,  Mr. Taub and Mr.
Muller  surrendered  the  Shares  to us and the  Shares  will be  cancelled  and
returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares.

AND THE COMMON  SHARES  ISSUABLE  UPON EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT MAY NOT BE SOLD,

SATISFACTORY TO BRAINSTORM CELL  THERAPEUTICS INC. THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED.

              Right to Purchase 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock of
                        BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc.
                   (subject to adjustment as provided herein)

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT AT $.00005 PER SHARE

                          Issue Date: December 23, 2004

      BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc., a corporation  organized under the laws
of the State of Washington  (the  "Company"),  hereby  certifies that, for value
received, Malcolm S. Taub, (the "Holder"), is entitled, subject to the terms set
forth below, to purchase from the Company at any time after the Issue Date up to
5:00 p.m.,  E.S.T on the TENTH  anniversary  of the Issue Date (the  "Expiration
Date"), up to 1,350,000 fully paid and nonassessable  shares of the common stock
of the Company (the "Common Stock"),  $.00005 par value per share at a per share
purchase  price of $.00005.  The  aforedescribed  purchase  price per share,  as
adjusted  from time to time as herein  provided,  is  referred  to herein as the
"Purchase  Price." The number and  character  of such shares of Common Stock and
the Purchase Price are subject to adjustment as provided herein. This Warrant is
that  certain  Warrant  referred to in the  Consulting  Agreement,  of even date
hereof, between the Company and the Holder.

      As used herein the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires,
have the following respective meanings:

      (a) The term "Company" shall include BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. and
any corporation which shall succeed or assume the obligations of BrainStorm Cell
Therapeutics Inc. hereunder.

      (b) The term "Common  Stock"  includes  (a) the  Company's  Common  Stock,
$.00005 par value per share, as authorized on the date hereof, and (b) any other
securities into which or for which any of the securities described in (a) may be
converted or exchanged pursuant to a plan of  recapitalization,  reorganization,
merger, sale of assets or otherwise.

      (c) The term  "Other  Securities"  refers to any stock  (other than Common
Stock) and other  securities  of the Company or any other person  (corporate  or
otherwise)  which the holder of the  Warrant at any time  shall be  entitled  to
receive,  or shall have received,  on the exercise of the Warrant, in lieu of or
in  addition  to Common  Stock,  or which at any time shall be issuable or shall
have been  issued in exchange  for or in  replacement  of Common  Stock or Other
Securities pursuant to Section 4 or otherwise.

      1. Exercise of Warrant.

            1.1.  Number of Shares  Issuable upon  Exercise.  From and after the
Issue Date through and including the Expiration Date, the Holder hereof shall be
entitled to receive,  upon exercise of this Warrant in whole in accordance  with
the  terms  of  subsection  1.2 or  upon  exercise  of this  Warrant  in part in
accordance with  subsection 1.3, shares of Common Stock of the Company,  subject
to  adjustment  pursuant  to Section 4. This  Warrant is fully  vested as of the
Issue Date.

<PAGE>

            1.2.  Full  Exercise.  This  Warrant may be exercised in full by the
Holder  hereof by  delivery  of an  original  or  facsimile  copy of the form of
subscription  attached  as  Exhibit  A hereto  (the  "Subscription  Form")  duly
executed by such Holder and surrender of the original  Warrant  within seven (7)
days of exercise, to the Company at its principal office or at the office of its
Warrant Agent (as provided  hereinafter),  accompanied by payment, in cash, wire
transfer  or by  certified  or official  bank check  payable to the order of the
Company,  in the amount  obtained by multiplying  the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Warrant is then  exercisable  by the Purchase Price then in
effect.

            1.3.  Partial  Exercise.  This Warrant may be exercised in part (but
not for a  fractional  share) by  surrender of this Warrant in the manner and at
the place  provided  in  subsection  1.2 except  that the amount  payable by the
Holder on such partial  exercise shall be the amount obtained by multiplying (a)
the  number of whole  shares of Common  Stock  designated  by the  Holder in the
Subscription  Form by (b) the Purchase Price then in effect. On any such partial
exercise,  the Company,  at its expense,  will forthwith issue and deliver to or
upon the order of the Holder hereof a new Warrant of like tenor,  in the name of
the  Holder  hereof  or as such  Holder  (upon  payment  by such  Holder  of any
applicable  transfer  taxes) may  request,  the whole number of shares of Common
Stock for which such Warrant may still be exercised.

            1.4. Fair Market Value. Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock
as of a particular date (the "Determination Date") shall mean:

                  (a) If the Company's  Common Stock is traded on an exchange or
is quoted on the National  Association  of Securities  Dealers,  Inc.  Automated
Quotation ("NASDAQ"),  National Market System, the NASDAQ SmallCap Market or the
American Stock Exchange, LLC, then the closing or last sale price, respectively,
reported for the last business day immediately preceding the Determination Date;

                  (b) If the Company's Common Stock is not traded on an exchange
or on the NASDAQ  National  Market  System,  the NASDAQ  SmallCap  Market or the
American Stock  Exchange,  Inc., but is traded in the  over-the-counter  market,
then  the  average  of the  closing  bid and ask  prices  reported  for the last
business day immediately preceding the Determination Date;

                  (c) Except as provided in clause (d) below,  if the  Company's
Common Stock is not publicly  traded,  then as the Holder and the Company agree,
or in the absence of such an agreement,  by arbitration  in accordance  with the
rules then  standing of the American  Arbitration  Association,  before a single
arbitrator  to be chosen  from a panel of persons  qualified  by  education  and
training to pass on the matter to be decided; or

                  (d) If the  Determination  Date is the date of a  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, or any event deemed to be a liquidation,  dissolution
or winding up pursuant to the Company's charter,  then all amounts to be payable
per share to holders of the Common Stock pursuant to the charter in the event of
such  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up,  plus all other  amounts to be
payable  per share in  respect  of the  Common  Stock in  liquidation  under the
charter,  assuming for the purposes of this clause (d) that all of the shares of
Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of all of the Warrants are  outstanding
at the Determination Date.

            1.5.  Company  Acknowledgment.  The Company will, at the time of the
exercise of the Warrant,  upon the request of the Holder hereof  acknowledge  in
writing its  continuing  obligation to afford to such Holder any rights to which
such Holder shall continue to be entitled after such exercise in accordance with
the  provisions  of this  Warrant.  If the  Holder  shall  fail to make any such
request,  such failure shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Company
to afford to such Holder any such rights.

<PAGE>

            1.6. Trustee for Warrant Holders.  In the event that a bank or trust
company  shall have been  appointed  as trustee  for the Holder of the  Warrants
pursuant to Subsection 3.2, such bank or trust company shall have all the powers
and duties of a warrant agent (as  hereinafter  described) and shall accept,  in
its own name for the account of the Company or such  successor  person as may be
entitled  thereto,  all  amounts  otherwise  payable  to  the  Company  or  such
successor,  as the case may be, on  exercise  of this  Warrant  pursuant to this
Section 1.

            1.7 Delivery of Stock  Certificates,  etc. on Exercise.  The Company
agrees that the shares of Common Stock  purchased  upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be deemed to be issued to the Holder  hereof as the  record  owner of such
shares as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant  shall have
been  surrendered  and  payment  made for such shares as  aforesaid.  As soon as
practicable  after the exercise of this  Warrant in full or in part,  and in any
event  within ten (10)  business  days  thereafter,  the  Company at its expense
(including  the payment by it of any  applicable  issue  taxes) will cause to be
issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder  hereof,  , a  certificate  or
certificates  for  the  number  of duly  and  validly  issued,  fully  paid  and
nonassessable  shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) to which such Holder
shall be entitled on such  exercise,  plus, in lieu of any  fractional  share to
which such Holder  would  otherwise  be  entitled,  cash equal to such  fraction
multiplied  by the then Fair  Market  Value of one full  share of Common  Stock,
together with any other stock or other securities and property  (including cash,
where  applicable) to which such Holder is entitled upon such exercise  pursuant
to Section 1 or otherwise.

      2. Exercise.

      This  Warrant  may be  exercisable  in  whole or in part  for  cash,  wire
transfer  or by  certified  or official  bank check  payable to the order of the
Company equal to the applicable aggregate Purchase Price.

      3. Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc.

            3.1. Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case at any time
or from  time to time,  the  Company  shall  (a)  effect a  reorganization,  (b)
consolidate  with  or  merge  into  any  other  person  or (c)  transfer  all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any other person under any plan
or arrangement  contemplating the dissolution of the Company, then, in each such
case,  as a condition  to the  consummation  of such a  transaction,  proper and
adequate  provision  shall be made by the  Company  whereby  the  Holder of this
Warrant,  on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1, at any time after the
consummation of such  reorganization,  consolidation  or merger or the effective
date of such  dissolution,  as the case may be,  shall  receive,  in lieu of the
Common  Stock (or Other  Securities)  issuable  on such  exercise  prior to such
consummation or such effective date, the stock and other securities and property
(including  cash) to which  such  Holder  would  have  been  entitled  upon such
consummation or in connection with such dissolution, as the case may be, if such
Holder had so exercised this Warrant,  immediately prior thereto, all subject to
further adjustment thereafter as provided in Section 4.

            3.2.  Dissolution.  In the event of any  dissolution  of the Company
following the transfer of all or substantially  all of its properties or assets,
the Company, prior to such dissolution, shall at its expense deliver or cause to
be delivered the stock and other securities and property  (including cash, where
applicable) receivable by the Holder of the Warrants after the effective date of
such  dissolution  pursuant  to this  Section  3 to a bank or trust  company  (a
"Trustee") as trustee for the Holder of the Warrants.

            3.3. Continuation of Terms. Upon any reorganization,  consolidation,
merger or transfer (and any dissolution  following any transfer)  referred to in
this  Section 3, this  Warrant  shall  continue in full force and effect and the
terms hereof shall be applicable to the Other Securities and property receivable
on the exercise of this Warrant after the  consummation of such  reorganization,
consolidation or merger or the effective date of dissolution  following any such
transfer,  as the case may be, and shall be binding upon the issuer of any Other
Securities,  including,  in the case of any such transfer,  the person acquiring
all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company,  whether or
not such  person  shall  have  expressly  assumed  the terms of this  Warrant as
provided in Section 4. In the event this Warrant does not continue in full force
and effect after the  consummation of the transaction  described in this Section
3, then only in such event will the Company's securities and property (including
cash, where applicable) receivable by the Holder of the Warrants be delivered to
the Trustee as contemplated by Section 3.2.

<PAGE>

      4.  Extraordinary  Events  Regarding  Common Stock.  In the event that the
Company shall (a) issue  additional  shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or
other  distribution on outstanding  Common Stock,  (b) subdivide its outstanding
shares of Common  Stock,  or (c)  combine its  outstanding  shares of the Common
Stock into a smaller  number of shares of the Common  Stock,  then, in each such
event,  the Purchase  Price  shall,  simultaneously  with the  happening of such
event,  be adjusted by multiplying  the then Purchase  Price by a fraction,  the
numerator  of which  shall be the number of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding
immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding  immediately  after such event,  and the
product so obtained shall  thereafter be the Purchase Price then in effect.  The
Purchase Price, as so adjusted,  shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the
happening of any successive  event or events described herein in this Section 4.
The  number of shares of Common  Stock  that the  Holder of this  Warrant  shall
thereafter,  on the  exercise  hereof as  provided  in Section 1, be entitled to
receive shall be adjusted to a number  determined by  multiplying  the number of
shares of Common  Stock that would  otherwise  (but for the  provisions  of this
Section 4) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator
is the  Purchase  Price that would  otherwise  (but for the  provisions  of this
Section 4) be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Purchase Price in effect
on the date of such exercise.

      5.  Certificate  as to  Adjustments.  In each  case of any  adjustment  or
readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the
exercise of the  Warrant,  the Company at its expense  will  promptly  cause its
Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment
or  readjustment  in  accordance  with the terms of the  Warrant  and  prepare a
certificate  setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such  adjustment  or  readjustment  is based,  including  a
statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any
additional shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed
to have been issued or sold,  (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other
Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding,  and (c) the Purchase Price
and the number of shares of Common  Stock to be received  upon  exercise of this
Warrant,  in effect  immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as
adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant.  The Company will  forthwith
mail a copy of each  such  certificate  to the  Holder  of the  Warrant  and any
Warrant Agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 11 hereof).

      6. Reservation of Stock, etc. Issuable on Exercise of Warrant. The Company
will at all times reserve and keep  available,  solely for issuance and delivery
on  the  exercise  of the  Warrants,  all  shares  of  Common  Stock  (or  Other
Securities) from time to time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant.

      7.  Non-transferable.  This Warrant is  non-transferable by the Holder and
any purported transfer hereof is null and void.

<PAGE>

      8. Replacement of Warrant. On receipt of evidence reasonably  satisfactory
to the Company of the loss,  theft,  destruction  or  mutilation of this Warrant
and, in the case of any such loss,  theft or  destruction  of this  Warrant,  on
delivery of an indemnity agreement or security  reasonably  satisfactory in form
and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such  mutilation,  on surrender
and cancellation of this Warrant,  the Company at its expense,  twice only, will
execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.

      9.  Registration  Rights.  The  Holder of this  Warrant  has been  granted
certain piggy back registration rights by the Company with respect to the shares
of Common Stock underlying this Warrant,  subject to underwriter discretion,  to
be included by the Company in a registration statement filed with the Securities
and  Exchange  Commission.  The Company  shall not be obligated by the Holder to
file a registration statement.

      10.  Maximum  Exercise.  The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this
Warrant on an exercise date, in connection  with that number of shares of Common
Stock  which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock  beneficially  owned by the Holder and its affiliates on an exercise date,
and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this
Warrant with respect to which the determination of this limitation is being made
on an exercise  date,  which would result in beneficial  ownership by the Holder
and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding  shares of Common Stock
on such date. For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  and Regulation 13d-3  thereunder.  Subject to
the  foregoing,  the Holder  shall not be limited to aggregate  exercises  which
would result in the issuance of more than 4.99%.  The  restriction  described in
this paragraph may be revoked upon and effective after sixty-one (61) days prior
notice  from the Holder to the  Company.  The Holder may  allocate  which of the
equity  of the  Company  deemed  beneficially  owned by the  Purchaser  shall be
included in the 4.99% amount described above and which shall be allocated to the

purchase  price of $.00005.  The  aforedescribed  purchase  price per share,  as
adjusted  from time to time as herein  provided,  is  referred  to herein as the
"Purchase  Price." The number and  character  of such shares of Common Stock and
the Purchase Price are subject to adjustment as provided herein. This Warrant is
that  certain  Warrant  referred to in the  Consulting  Agreement,  of even date
hereof, between the Company and the Holder.

      As used herein the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires,
have the following respective meanings:

      (a) The term "Company" shall include BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. and
any corporation which shall succeed or assume the obligations of BrainStorm Cell
Therapeutics Inc. hereunder.

      (b) The term "Common  Stock"  includes  (a) the  Company's  Common  Stock,
$.00005 par value per share, as authorized on the date hereof, and (b) any other
securities into which or for which any of the securities described in (a) may be
converted or exchanged pursuant to a plan of  recapitalization,  reorganization,
merger, sale of assets or otherwise.

      (c) The term  "Other  Securities"  refers to any stock  (other than Common
Stock) and other  securities  of the Company or any other person  (corporate  or
otherwise)  which the holder of the  Warrant at any time  shall be  entitled  to
receive,  or shall have received,  on the exercise of the Warrant, in lieu of or
in  addition  to Common  Stock,  or which at any time shall be issuable or shall
have been  issued in exchange  for or in  replacement  of Common  Stock or Other
Securities pursuant to Section 4 or otherwise.

      1. Exercise of Warrant.

            1.1.  Number of Shares  Issuable upon  Exercise.  From and after the
Issue Date through and including the Expiration Date, the Holder hereof shall be
entitled to receive,  upon exercise of this Warrant in whole in accordance  with
the  terms  of  subsection  1.2 or  upon  exercise  of this  Warrant  in part in
accordance with  subsection 1.3, shares of Common Stock of the Company,  subject
to  adjustment  pursuant  to Section 4. This  Warrant is fully  vested as of the
Issue Date.

<PAGE>

            1.2.  Full  Exercise.  This  Warrant may be exercised in full by the
Holder  hereof by  delivery  of an  original  or  facsimile  copy of the form of
subscription  attached  as  Exhibit  A hereto  (the  "Subscription  Form")  duly
executed by such Holder and surrender of the original  Warrant  within seven (7)
days of exercise, to the Company at its principal office or at the office of its
Warrant Agent (as provided  hereinafter),  accompanied by payment, in cash, wire
transfer  or by  certified  or official  bank check  payable to the order of the
Company,  in the amount  obtained by multiplying  the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Warrant is then  exercisable  by the Purchase Price then in
effect.

            1.3.  Partial  Exercise.  This Warrant may be exercised in part (but
not for a  fractional  share) by  surrender of this Warrant in the manner and at
the place  provided  in  subsection  1.2 except  that the amount  payable by the
Holder on such partial  exercise shall be the amount obtained by multiplying (a)
the  number of whole  shares of Common  Stock  designated  by the  Holder in the
Subscription  Form by (b) the Purchase Price then in effect. On any such partial
exercise,  the Company,  at its expense,  will forthwith issue and deliver to or
upon the order of the Holder hereof a new Warrant of like tenor,  in the name of
the  Holder  hereof  or as such  Holder  (upon  payment  by such  Holder  of any
applicable  transfer  taxes) may  request,  the whole number of shares of Common
Stock for which such Warrant may still be exercised.

            1.4. Fair Market Value. Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock
as of a particular date (the "Determination Date") shall mean:

                  (a) If the Company's  Common Stock is traded on an exchange or
is quoted on the National  Association  of Securities  Dealers,  Inc.  Automated
Quotation ("NASDAQ"),  National Market System, the NASDAQ SmallCap Market or the
American Stock Exchange, LLC, then the closing or last sale price, respectively,
reported for the last business day immediately preceding the Determination Date;

                  (b) If the Company's Common Stock is not traded on an exchange
or on the NASDAQ  National  Market  System,  the NASDAQ  SmallCap  Market or the
American Stock  Exchange,  Inc., but is traded in the  over-the-counter  market,
then  the  average  of the  closing  bid and ask  prices  reported  for the last
business day immediately preceding the Determination Date;

                  (c) Except as provided in clause (d) below,  if the  Company's
Common Stock is not publicly  traded,  then as the Holder and the Company agree,
or in the absence of such an agreement,  by arbitration  in accordance  with the
rules then  standing of the American  Arbitration  Association,  before a single
arbitrator  to be chosen  from a panel of persons  qualified  by  education  and
training to pass on the matter to be decided; or

                  (d) If the  Determination  Date is the date of a  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, or any event deemed to be a liquidation,  dissolution
or winding up pursuant to the Company's charter,  then all amounts to be payable
per share to holders of the Common Stock pursuant to the charter in the event of
such  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up,  plus all other  amounts to be
payable  per share in  respect  of the  Common  Stock in  liquidation  under the
charter,  assuming for the purposes of this clause (d) that all of the shares of
Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of all of the Warrants are  outstanding
at the Determination Date.

            1.5.  Company  Acknowledgment.  The Company will, at the time of the
exercise of the Warrant,  upon the request of the Holder hereof  acknowledge  in
writing its  continuing  obligation to afford to such Holder any rights to which
such Holder shall continue to be entitled after such exercise in accordance with
the  provisions  of this  Warrant.  If the  Holder  shall  fail to make any such
request,  such failure shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Company
to afford to such Holder any such rights.
<PAGE>


            1.6. Trustee for Warrant Holders.  In the event that a bank or trust
company  shall have been  appointed  as trustee  for the Holder of the  Warrants
pursuant to Subsection 3.2, such bank or trust company shall have all the powers
and duties of a warrant agent (as  hereinafter  described) and shall accept,  in
its own name for the account of the Company or such  successor  person as may be
entitled  thereto,  all  amounts  otherwise  payable  to  the  Company  or  such
successor,  as the case may be, on  exercise  of this  Warrant  pursuant to this
Section 1.

            1.7 Delivery of Stock  Certificates,  etc. on Exercise.  The Company
agrees that the shares of Common Stock  purchased  upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be deemed to be issued to the Holder  hereof as the  record  owner of such
shares as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant  shall have
been  surrendered  and  payment  made for such shares as  aforesaid.  As soon as
practicable  after the exercise of this  Warrant in full or in part,  and in any
event  within ten (10)  business  days  thereafter,  the  Company at its expense
(including  the payment by it of any  applicable  issue  taxes) will cause to be
issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder  hereof,  , a  certificate  or
certificates  for  the  number  of duly  and  validly  issued,  fully  paid  and
nonassessable  shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) to which such Holder
shall be entitled on such  exercise,  plus, in lieu of any  fractional  share to
which such Holder  would  otherwise  be  entitled,  cash equal to such  fraction
multiplied  by the then Fair  Market  Value of one full  share of Common  Stock,
together with any other stock or other securities and property  (including cash,
where  applicable) to which such Holder is entitled upon such exercise  pursuant
to Section 1 or otherwise.

      2. Exercise.

      This  Warrant  may be  exercisable  in  whole or in part  for  cash,  wire
transfer  or by  certified  or official  bank check  payable to the order of the
Company equal to the applicable aggregate Purchase Price.

      3. Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc.

            3.1. Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case at any time
or from  time to time,  the  Company  shall  (a)  effect a  reorganization,  (b)
consolidate  with  or  merge  into  any  other  person  or (c)  transfer  all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any other person under any plan
or arrangement  contemplating the dissolution of the Company, then, in each such
case,  as a condition  to the  consummation  of such a  transaction,  proper and
adequate  provision  shall be made by the  Company  whereby  the  Holder of this
Warrant,  on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1, at any time after the
consummation of such  reorganization,  consolidation  or merger or the effective
date of such  dissolution,  as the case may be,  shall  receive,  in lieu of the
Common  Stock (or Other  Securities)  issuable  on such  exercise  prior to such
consummation or such effective date, the stock and other securities and property
(including  cash) to which  such  Holder  would  have  been  entitled  upon such
consummation or in connection with such dissolution, as the case may be, if such
Holder had so exercised this Warrant,  immediately prior thereto, all subject to
further adjustment thereafter as provided in Section 4.

            3.2.  Dissolution.  In the event of any  dissolution  of the Company
following the transfer of all or substantially  all of its properties or assets,
the Company, prior to such dissolution, shall at its expense deliver or cause to
be delivered the stock and other securities and property  (including cash, where
applicable) receivable by the Holder of the Warrants after the effective date of
such  dissolution  pursuant  to this  Section  3 to a bank or trust  company  (a
"Trustee") as trustee for the Holder of the Warrants.

<PAGE>

            3.3. Continuation of Terms. Upon any reorganization,  consolidation,
merger or transfer (and any dissolution  following any transfer)  referred to in
this  Section 3, this  Warrant  shall  continue in full force and effect and the
terms hereof shall be applicable to the Other Securities and property receivable
on the exercise of this Warrant after the  consummation of such  reorganization,
consolidation or merger or the effective date of dissolution  following any such
transfer,  as the case may be, and shall be binding upon the issuer of any Other
Securities,  including,  in the case of any such transfer,  the person acquiring
all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company,  whether or
not such  person  shall  have  expressly  assumed  the terms of this  Warrant as
provided in Section 4. In the event this Warrant does not continue in full force
and effect after the  consummation of the transaction  described in this Section
3, then only in such event will the Company's securities and property (including
cash, where applicable) receivable by the Holder of the Warrants be delivered to
the Trustee as contemplated by Section 3.2.

      4.  Extraordinary  Events  Regarding  Common Stock.  In the event that the
Company shall (a) issue  additional  shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or
other  distribution on outstanding  Common Stock,  (b) subdivide its outstanding
shares of Common  Stock,  or (c)  combine its  outstanding  shares of the Common
Stock into a smaller  number of shares of the Common  Stock,  then, in each such
event,  the Purchase  Price  shall,  simultaneously  with the  happening of such
event,  be adjusted by multiplying  the then Purchase  Price by a fraction,  the
numerator  of which  shall be the number of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding
immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding  immediately  after such event,  and the
product so obtained shall  thereafter be the Purchase Price then in effect.  The
Purchase Price, as so adjusted,  shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the
happening of any successive  event or events described herein in this Section 4.
The  number of shares of Common  Stock  that the  Holder of this  Warrant  shall
thereafter,  on the  exercise  hereof as  provided  in Section 1, be entitled to
receive shall be adjusted to a number  determined by  multiplying  the number of
shares of Common  Stock that would  otherwise  (but for the  provisions  of this
Section 4) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator
is the  Purchase  Price that would  otherwise  (but for the  provisions  of this
Section 4) be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Purchase Price in effect
on the date of such exercise.

      5.  Certificate  as to  Adjustments.  In each  case of any  adjustment  or
readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the
exercise of the  Warrant,  the Company at its expense  will  promptly  cause its
Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment
or  readjustment  in  accordance  with the terms of the  Warrant  and  prepare a
certificate  setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such  adjustment  or  readjustment  is based,  including  a
statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any
additional shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed
to have been issued or sold,  (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other
Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding,  and (c) the Purchase Price
and the number of shares of Common  Stock to be received  upon  exercise of this
Warrant,  in effect  immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as
adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant.  The Company will  forthwith
mail a copy of each  such  certificate  to the  Holder  of the  Warrant  and any
Warrant Agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 11 hereof).

      6. Reservation of Stock, etc. Issuable on Exercise of Warrant. The Company
will at all times reserve and keep  available,  solely for issuance and delivery
on  the  exercise  of the  Warrants,  all  shares  of  Common  Stock  (or  Other
Securities) from time to time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant.

      7.  Non-transferable.  This Warrant is  non-transferable by the Holder and
any purported transfer hereof is null and void.

<PAGE>

      8. Replacement of Warrant. On receipt of evidence reasonably  satisfactory
to the Company of the loss,  theft,  destruction  or  mutilation of this Warrant
and, in the case of any such loss,  theft or  destruction  of this  Warrant,  on
delivery of an indemnity agreement or security  reasonably  satisfactory in form
and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such  mutilation,  on surrender
and cancellation of this Warrant,  the Company at its expense,  twice only, will
execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.

      9.  Registration  Rights.  The  Holder of this  Warrant  has been  granted
certain piggy back registration rights by the Company with respect to the shares
of Common Stock underlying this Warrant,  subject to underwriter discretion,  to
be included by the Company in a registration statement filed with the Securities
and  Exchange  Commission.  The Company  shall not be obligated by the Holder to
file a registration statement.

      10.  Maximum  Exercise.  The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this
Warrant on an exercise date, in connection  with that number of shares of Common
Stock  which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock  beneficially  owned by the Holder and its affiliates on an exercise date,
and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this
Warrant with respect to which the determination of this limitation is being made
on an exercise  date,  which would result in beneficial  ownership by the Holder
and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding  shares of Common Stock
on such date. For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  and Regulation 13d-3  thereunder.  Subject to
the  foregoing,  the Holder  shall not be limited to aggregate  exercises  which
would result in the issuance of more than 4.99%.  The  restriction  described in
this paragraph may be revoked upon and effective after sixty-one (61) days prior
notice  from the Holder to the  Company.  The Holder may  allocate  which of the
equity  of the  Company  deemed  beneficially  owned by the  Purchaser  shall be
included in the 4.99% amount described above and which shall be allocated to the
excess above 4.99%.

      11. Notices. All notices,  demands,  requests,  consents,  approvals,  and
other  communications  required or permitted  hereunder shall be in writing and,
unless  otherwise  specified  herein,  shall  be  (i)  personally  served,  (ii)

consideration  for services  rendered  Taub was issued  1,350,000  shares of the
Common Stock of the Company (the "SHARES");

      Whereas,  due to a discrepancy in the valuation of the Shares, the Parties
have  rescinded  the First  Agreement,  Taub has  surrendered  the Shares to the
Company for  cancellation,  and the  Parties  have agreed to enter into this new
Consulting Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set forth
herein,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,  the
Parties hereto agree as follows:

1. SERVICES.  Taub shall use its best efforts to perform the following  services
in a timely manner:  to become  familiar with the business and operations of the
Company so that he (i) may introduce the company to entities or individuals that
would enhance and accelerate the  commercialization  of the Company's technology
and business  objectives and (ii) work with the Company,  if needed,  on capital
structure, management, reorganization and related corporate issues.

2. TERM.  This  Agreement  shall be in effect for twelve  months from August 10,
2004.  Taub shall not be  required  to be  available  at any  specific  time for
consultation;  shall not be required to appear at the offices of the Company and
may perform such service  telephonically,  by e-mail or in any other  reasonable
manner.

3. CONSIDERATION. For the valuable advice and services to be provided by Taub to
the Company  under this  Agreement,  the  Company  shall issue Taub a Warrant to
purchase up to  1,350,000  shares of the  Company's  common stock at a per share
purchase price of $0.00005.  The Warrant shall be fully vested as of the date of
issuance,  exercisable  at any time for a period of 10 years  from such date and
fully issued upon delivery thereof.

4.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  The Company represents and warrants to Taub
that the statements  contained in paragraph 4 are correct and complete as of the
Effective  Date:  (a) The  Company  is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly
existing  and  active  under  the laws of its  state of  incorporation.  (b) The
Company has full  corporate  power and  authority to (i) conduct its business as
now  conducted and as proposed to be conducted  and to own,  use,  license,  and
lease its  assets and  properties  and (ii)  enter  into this  Agreement  and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

5. INDEMNITY.  The Company agrees to indemnify,  defend,  and hold harmless Taub
and his affiliates,  counsel, employees, agents, successors, and assigns. (each,
an "Indemnified  Party") from and against any and all losses,  claims,  damages,
costs, expenses, and liabilities (including any investigatory,  legal, and other
expenses  incurred as they are incurred by an  Indemnified  Party in  connection
with preparing for or defending any action, claim, or proceeding, whether or not
resulting in any liability) (collectively,  "Indemnifiable Losses") to which any
Indemnified Party may become subject or liable relating to or arising out of (a)
the services to be  performed  under the  Agreement,  (b) any  inaccuracy  in or
breach in the  representations  and warranties of the Company  contained in this
Agreement,  and (c) any failure of the Company to perform its obligations  under
this Agreement,  provided that the Company shall not be liable to an Indemnified
Party in any such case to the extent that any such  Indemnifiable  Loss is found
in a final,  nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted as a direct and  proximate  cause from the willful  misconduct or gross
negligence  of an  Indemnified  Party.  No  Indemnified  Party  shall be liable,
responsible,  or  accountable  in  damages  and  costs and  expenses  (including
attorneys'  fees)  under this  Agreement  except for any  liability  for losses,
claims,  damages, or liabilities finally judicially  determined to have resulted
solely and  exclusively  from  actions  taken or omitted to be taken as a direct
result of such Indemnified  Party's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  If
for any reason,  except as specifically provided herein, the foregoing indemnity
for Indemnifiable  Losses is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient
to fully  hold any  Indemnified  Party  harmless,  then the  Company  agrees  to
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such  Indemnified  Party as a result
of such Indemnifiable Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by and fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the
relative benefits received by and fault of Taub, on the other hand.

laws of the State of New York. Any  controversy,  dispute,  or claim between the
parties  relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding  arbitration in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

7.  REPRESENTATION.  The Company  acknowledges  that it has been given notice by
Taub that Taub is not a licensed securities  broker-dealer and therefore Taub is
not required under this Agreement or any side agreement,  whether verbally or in
writing,  to sell  securities on behalf of the Company or any issuer  affiliated
with the Company.  Moreover,  the Company acknowledges that Taub does not intend
to  negotiate  raising of  capital  transactions,  does not  intend to  directly
solicit  purchasers  of the Company's  common stock,  will not hold any funds or
securities in a capital raising transaction, and the compensation due to Taub is
not based on a specified  percentage of any actual or proposed funds raised. The
Company  acknowledges that Taub has informed it that neither Taub nor any of its
members or employees provides any legal advice or counsel.

other business activities.  Since Taub is an independent contractor,  nothing in
this  Agreement  shall be  interpreted  to  constitute  that  Taub is an  agent,
employee,  or partner of the Company,  nor shall either party have any authority
to bind the other.  In  furtherance  of, but  without  limiting  the  foregoing,
Company  shall  not  be  responsible  for  payment  of  workers'   compensation,
disability benefits, unemployment insurance and for withholding or paying income
taxes and social security for Taub but such responsibility  shall be solely that
of Taub.

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties  pertaining to the subject  matter hereof and supersedes and cancels any
prior communications,  representations,  understandings,  and agreements between
the parties.  No modifications of or changes to this Agreement shall be binding,
nor can any of its  provisions  be  waived,  unless  agreed to in writing by the
parties. There are no side agreements,  whether verbally or in writing,  between
the Company and Taub.

IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and
year first above written.
