ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 23, 2004 following the rescission of consulting  agreements with Mr.
Malcolm  E. Taub and Mr.  Ernest  Muller  dated  August  10,  2004,  as  further
described in Item 1.02 of this report, we entered into new consulting agreements
with each of Messrs.  Taub and Muller.  The new agreements have a term of twelve
months from August 10, 2004 (the date of the original  agreements).  Pursuant to
the new agreements,  in consideration for the services  performed,  Mr. Taub and
Mr. Muller were issued,  respectively,  warrants to purchase up to 1,350,000 and
450,000  shares of our Common Stock at a per share  exercise  price of par value
($0.00005  per share).  These  warrants  are fully  vested on the date of grant,
exercisable for a period of 10 years from such date and are non-transferable.  A
copy of the new agreements and the warrants are attached  hereto,  respectively,
as Exhibits 10.07 and 10.08, and 4.05 and 4.06.

ITEM 1.02. TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

In August 10, 2004, we had entered into  consulting  agreements with Mr. Malcolm
E. Taub and Mr. Ernest Muller  pursuant to which they were issued  1,350,000 and
450,000 shares of our Common Stock  respectively (the "Shares") as consideration
for the services performed.  Due to a discrepancy regarding the valuation of the
Shares, on December 23, 2004 the parties  rescinded the original  agreements and
entered  into new  agreements  as set  forth  in Item  1.01 of this  report.  In
connection  with the  rescission  of the original  agreements,  Mr. Taub and Mr.
Muller  surrendered  the  Shares  to us and the  Shares  will be  cancelled  and
returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares.
