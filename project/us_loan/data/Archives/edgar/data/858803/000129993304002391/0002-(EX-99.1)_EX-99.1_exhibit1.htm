<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>AVANIR ANNOUNCES SUBMISSION OF ROLLING NDA<BR>
WITH PRIORITY REVIEW FOR NEURODEX<FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#228;</FONT></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt">San Diego, December&nbsp;16, 2004 &#151; <FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS">Avanir</FONT> Pharmaceuticals (AMEX: AVN) announced
today it has begun submission of a New Drug Application (NDA)&nbsp;seeking marketing approval of
Neurodex<FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#228;</FONT> an investigational drug for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)&nbsp;offered a &#147;rolling&#148; review of a new drug application (NDA)&nbsp;for
Neurodex and also indicated that Neurodex would qualify for a priority review when the submission
is complete. <FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS">Avanir</FONT> expects to complete its submission in the first half of 2005.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS">Avanir</FONT> is seeking approval of Neurodex as a therapy for patients with pseudobulbar
affect (PBA), a symptom complex that is characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying or
laughing. An estimated one million patients with neurological conditions such as ALS or Lou
Gehrig&#146;s disease, Alzheimer&#146;s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke and traumatic brain injury
may be affected by PBA. The NDA for Neurodex will be supported by data from two controlled,
multicenter Phase III clinical trials conducted in the U.S. and Israel.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">&#147;<FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS">Avanir</FONT> has worked diligently to expeditiously develop Neurodex and we are very
pleased that the FDA will allow us to submit our NDA on a rolling basis with priority review when
the submission is complete,&#148; said James E. Berg, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs
at <FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS">Avanir</FONT>. &#147;PBA is becoming recognized as a condition that has a profound effect on
quality of life for people that suffer from neurological disorders. With no drug indicated for the
treatment of PBA, this NDA submission represents an important step forward in the potential care
and treatment of patients suffering from pseudobulbar affect.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">The company is utilizing a process that allows an NDA to be submitted on an ongoing basis. A
rolling review will allow the FDA to evaluate modules of the NDA as they are submitted.
Additionally, the FDA has indicated that the Neurodex NDA is eligible for a priority preview. Per
the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA&#146;s goal is to complete priority reviews within 6
months compared to 10-12&nbsp;months for a standard PDUFA review.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS">avanir</FONT> has the exclusive license to develop, manufacture and market Neurodex for four
potential indications: pseudobulbar affect, neuropathic pain, chronic cough and weaning
drug-dependent patients from narcotics and anti-depressants. The company in-licensed the product
in August&nbsp;2000. In June&nbsp;2002 the first pivotal Phase III trial in ALS patients with PBA was
completed. In June&nbsp;2004 the second pivotal Phase III trial in MS patients with MS and PBA was
completed. In June&nbsp;2003 a Phase II trial in diabetic neuropathic pain was completed. There are
six U.S. patents issued for Neurodex.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Management will host a conference call with simultaneous webcast today, December&nbsp;16<sup>th
</sup>at 1:30 p.m. Pacific/ 4:30 p.m. Eastern to discuss fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2004
operating performance as well as the NDA submission. The call/webcast will feature President and
Chief Executive Officer Gerald J. Yakatan, Ph.D. and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
