Section 8

Item 8.01 - Other Events.

         At the Special Meeting of Shareholders held on December 16, 2004, the
shareholders of the Registrant voted in favor of an amendment to its Articles of
Incorporation to effect a 1 for 110 reverse stock split and repurchase resulting
fractional shares. Upon implementing the reverse stock split, there will be less
than 300 shareholders of record of the Registrant's common stock. The Registrant
will then be eligible, and intends to terminate the registration of its common
stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Registrant's duty to
file periodic reports, such as quarterly and annual reports, and to make other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission will then end. As a result,
the Registrant would no longer incur the substantial economic burden of being a
public company when it could not obtain the principal benefits of being a public
company- in particular, having a sustained public market and liquidity for its
common stock; and, the ability to raise capital in the public market.

         651,856 shares were represented at the Meeting, more than a majority of
the 969,127 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the
amendment as of the November 5, 2004 record date. 544,318 shares were voted in
favor of the amendment; 104,712 shares against; and 826 shares abstained from
voting.

         The shareholders overwhelmingly approved the amendment enabling the
Registrant to cease SEC reporting and repurchase post-reverse split fractional
shares at $1 per share (on a pre-split share price basis). However, the
Registrant will not at this time implement the amendment because of pending
litigation with Robert Robotti and two affiliated entities ("Robotti").

         Robotti owns approximately five percent (5%) of the Registrant's common
stock. Robotti bought additional shares during the past year knowing that the
Registrant would seek shareholder approval of the amendment. Almost a year
before the Meeting Robotti notified the Registrant that he wanted to buy all of
its outstanding shares for $1. Later he made other offers, all of which were
rejected by the Registrant and are disclosed in the Registrant's Proxy Statement
related to the Shareholder Meeting. Shortly before the Meeting, Robotti filed an
action in the Federal District Court, Southern District of New York seeking to
prevent the Meeting. Robotti claimed that the Registrant's Proxy Statement was
materially inaccurate regarding, among other things, the information regarding
the value of the Registrant's assets. Robotti sought a court order to require
the Registrant to amend the Proxy Statement in accordance with his views if the
Registrant were to proceed with a shareholders meeting. The Registrant responded
by filing a motion to transfer the case to the Federal District Court for
Wyoming, where the Registrant is incorporated and has its principal place of
business. The Registrant also filed a motion for dismissal. At the suggestion of
the Court, the parties agreed to enter a standstill agreement under which the
Shareholder Meeting and vote would proceed, but the amendment - if approved by
the shareholders - would not be made effective pending resolution of the
litigation. On December 21, 2004 the Court granted Registrant's motion and
transferred the action from New York to Wyoming, where Registrant's motion to
dismiss will be ruled on.
