ITEM  5.02.     ELECTION  OF  DIRECTORS

     On December 16, 2004, the Board of Directors of NBOG Bancorporation, Inc.
(the "Company") elected R. Allen Smith to the Board of Directors, subject to any
required regulatory approval. It is not expected that Mr. Smith will be named to
any committees of the Company.

     During 2004, prior to his election to the Board of Directors, Mr. Smith had
served as an Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer
and consultant to the Company. Mr. Smith's compensation (both current and
deferred) in connection with these positions was $70,172. On December 16, 2004,
the Board also granted Mr. Smith a non-qualified option to purchase 27,500
shares of common stock of the Company, with an exercise price of $10.00 a share.
The option will vest in equal annual increments over three years from the grant
date, and will expire on December 16, 2014.

     The Company's directors and officers, and the businesses and other
organizations with which they are associated, from time to time may have banking
transactions in the ordinary course of business with The National Bank of
Gainesville (the "Bank"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Bank's
policy is that any loans or other commitments to those persons or entities be
made in accordance with applicable law and on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with other persons or entities of similar standing. All
transactions with affiliates must be on terms no less favorable than could be
obtained from an unaffiliated third party and must be approved by a majority of
directors including a majority of disinterested directors.

     In addition, each loan by the Bank to any officer, director or controlling
person of the Bank or any of its affiliates may be made only in compliance with
the following conditions:

     The loan:

     -    must  be  evidenced  by a promissory note naming the Bank as payee and
          must  contain an annual percentage rate which is reasonably comparable
          to that normally charged to non-affiliates by other commercial lenders
          for  similar  loans  made  in  the  Bank's  locale;

     -    must  be  repaid  according  to appropriate amortization schedules and
          contain  default provisions comparable to those normally used by other
          commercial  lenders  for  similar  loans made to non-affiliates in the
          Bank's  locale;

     -    must be made only if credit reports and financial statements, or other
          reasonable  investigation appropriate in light of the nature and terms
          of  the  loan  and which meet the loan policies normally used by other
          commercial  lenders  for  similar  loans made to non-affiliates in the
          Bank's  locale,  show  the  loan  to be collectible and the borrower a
          satisfactory  credit  risk;  and

     -    the  purpose of the loan and the disbursement of proceeds are reviewed
          and  monitored  in  a manner comparable to that normally used by other
          commercial  lenders  for  similar  loans  made  in  the Bank's locale.
