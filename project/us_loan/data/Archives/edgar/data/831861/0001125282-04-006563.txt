ITEM 3.01.  NOTICE OF DELISTING OR FAILURE TO SATISFY A CONTINUED LISTING RULE
            OR STANDARD; TRANSFER OF LISTING.

         Concord Camera Corp. ("Concord" or "Company") announced today that
Concord has appealed the determination of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications
Staff to delist the Company's securities because the Nasdaq Stock Market
("Nasdaq") had not received Concord's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of Fiscal
2005, which ended October 2, 2004. As previously announced by Concord on
November 8, 2004, the conversion of Concord's management information systems in
August 2004 from its existing Legacy systems to a new worldwide, fully
integrated Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") software system resulted in
inefficiencies and delays in providing certain information necessary to complete
the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In its appeal, the Company advised
Nasdaq that it expects to file its First Quarter Form 10-Q on or before January
31, 2005 and requested an exception to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing
standards. The Company expects to be notified of the decision by the Nasdaq
Listing Qualifications Panel within 30 days. Concord's securities will remain
listed pending the result of the appeal.

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

(c)  A copy of Concord's press release dated December 29, 2004 is attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1.


                                    SIGNATURE

         Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
