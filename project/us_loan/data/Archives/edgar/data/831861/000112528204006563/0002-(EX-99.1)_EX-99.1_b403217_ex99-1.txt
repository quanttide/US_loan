                              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      CONCORD CAMERA CORP. ANNOUNCES THE APPEAL OF NASDAQ DELISTING NOTICE


HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 29, 2004 - CONCORD CAMERA CORP. ("CONCORD" OR
"COMPANY") (NASDAQ: LENSE) announced today that Concord has appealed the
determination of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff to delist the Company's
securities because the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") had not received Concord's
Form 10-Q for the first quarter of Fiscal 2005, which ended October 2, 2004. As
previously announced by Concord on November 8, 2004, the conversion of Concord's
management information systems in August 2004 from its existing Legacy systems
to a new worldwide, fully integrated Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP")
software system resulted in inefficiencies and delays in providing certain
information necessary to complete the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
In its appeal, the Company advised Nasdaq that it expects to file its First
Quarter Form 10-Q on or before January 31, 2005 and requested an exception to
regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards. The Company expects to be
notified of the decision by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel within 30
days. Concord's securities will remain listed pending the result of the appeal.
