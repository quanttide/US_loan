Item 8.01       OTHER EVENTS

In April 2002, ZF Micro  Solutions,  Inc.  brought suit against us in California
Superior  Court  alleging a number of  contract  and tort  claims  related to an
agreement we entered into in 1999 to design and manufacture a custom  integrated
circuit device for ZF Micro Devices. ZF Micro Devices ceased business operations
in February 2002 and the case was brought by ZF Micro  Solutions as successor to
ZF Micro  Devices.  The case began trial in May 2004 and on June 14,  2004,  the
jury  in the  case  found  for ZF  Micro  Solutions  on a claim  on  intentional
misrepresentation, awarding damages of $28.0 million and on a claim of breach of
the implied  covenant of good faith and fair dealing,  awarding  damages of $2.0
million. On seven other claims brought by the plaintiff,  the jury found for us.
The jury also  found  for us on our  breach of  contract  cross-claim,  awarding
damages of $1.1 million.  In response to our challenges to the verdicts in favor
of ZF Micro  Solutions in post-trial  motions,  the court ordered a new trial on
all  issues  and a new trial  date of  February  22,  2005 was set by the court.
During a settlement  conference held December 16, 2004, the case was settled. We
have agreed to pay to the plaintiff  the sum of $20 million,  which must be paid
into an escrow  account no later than  January 5,  2005.  In  addition,  we have
agreed to grant the  plaintiff a royalty  free license for the  manufacture  and
sale of the custom  device at issue in the case.  All claims will be released by
the parties  and the case  dismissed  once the  settlement  documents  have been
completed and the settlement funds released to the plaintiff.
