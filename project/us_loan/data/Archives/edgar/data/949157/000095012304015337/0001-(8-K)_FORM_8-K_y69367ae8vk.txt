ITEM 1.01    ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 28, 2004, Century Aluminum Company ("Century") and its
subsidiary borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated
as of April 2, 2001 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
and in effect from time to time, the "Revolving Credit Facility"), entered into
a Consent and Fourth Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement effective as of
October 29, 2004 (the "Fourth Amendment") with Fleet Capital Corporation, as
agent and lender, and a syndicate of other lenders party to the Revolving Credit
Facility. The Fourth Amendment amends the Revolving Credit Facility to permit
Century to make additional loans and/or equity contributions to its subsidiary,
Nordural ehf. ("Nordural"), in an amount of up to $75 million (in addition to
previously permitted investments) to finance a portion of the costs associated
with the ongoing expansion of the Nordural facility and to provide working
capital to Nordural. Century is required to have borrowing availability of at
least $50 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time of making any
loan or contribution of all or any part of the $75 million to Nordural.

         Credit Suisse First Boston, which is a lender party to the Fourth
Amendment, Fleet Capital Corporation and/or their affiliates have from time to
time performed and may in the future perform various financial advisory,
commercial banking and investment banking services for us in the ordinary course
of business, for which they received or will receive customary fees. An
affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston acted (i) as an underwriter in
connection with Century's April 2004 public equity offering of its common stock
and (ii) as dealer manager and solicitation agent in connection with Century's
tender offer and consent solicitation for its 11.75% senior secured first
mortgage notes due 2008. Affiliates of Credit Suisse First Boston and Fleet
Capital Corporation were initial purchasers in connection with Century's (i)
private offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.75%
Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2024 and (ii) private offering of $250.0
million aggregate principal amount of its 7.5% Senior Notes due August 15, 2014.
Credit Suisse First Boston and Fleet Capital Corporation and/or their affiliates
may also participate in a planned new term loan facility to be entered into by
Nordural.

         The description of the Fourth Amendment set forth above does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Fourth Amendment, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K
as Exhibit 10.1.
