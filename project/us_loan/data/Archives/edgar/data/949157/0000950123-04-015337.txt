ITEM 1.01    ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 28, 2004, Century Aluminum Company ("Century") and its
subsidiary borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated
as of April 2, 2001 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
and in effect from time to time, the "Revolving Credit Facility"), entered into
a Consent and Fourth Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement effective as of
October 29, 2004 (the "Fourth Amendment") with Fleet Capital Corporation, as
agent and lender, and a syndicate of other lenders party to the Revolving Credit
Facility. The Fourth Amendment amends the Revolving Credit Facility to permit
Century to make additional loans and/or equity contributions to its subsidiary,
Nordural ehf. ("Nordural"), in an amount of up to $75 million (in addition to
previously permitted investments) to finance a portion of the costs associated
with the ongoing expansion of the Nordural facility and to provide working
capital to Nordural. Century is required to have borrowing availability of at
least $50 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time of making any
loan or contribution of all or any part of the $75 million to Nordural.

         Credit Suisse First Boston, which is a lender party to the Fourth
Amendment, Fleet Capital Corporation and/or their affiliates have from time to
time performed and may in the future perform various financial advisory,
commercial banking and investment banking services for us in the ordinary course
of business, for which they received or will receive customary fees. An
affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston acted (i) as an underwriter in
connection with Century's April 2004 public equity offering of its common stock
and (ii) as dealer manager and solicitation agent in connection with Century's
tender offer and consent solicitation for its 11.75% senior secured first
mortgage notes due 2008. Affiliates of Credit Suisse First Boston and Fleet
Capital Corporation were initial purchasers in connection with Century's (i)
private offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.75%
Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2024 and (ii) private offering of $250.0
million aggregate principal amount of its 7.5% Senior Notes due August 15, 2014.
Credit Suisse First Boston and Fleet Capital Corporation and/or their affiliates
may also participate in a planned new term loan facility to be entered into by
Nordural.

         The description of the Fourth Amendment set forth above does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Fourth Amendment, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K
as Exhibit 10.1.

rate protection agreement between any Borrower and a Lender evidencing
Derivative Obligations" immediately before the period in such definition and
substituting the words "any agreement or document between any Borrower and a
Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender evidencing Derivative Obligations or Bank
Product Obligations" in lieu thereof.

                  (c) The definition of "Obligations" is hereby amended by
deleting such definition in its entirety and substituting the following
definition in lieu thereof:

                  "Obligations. All indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of

the Agent, individually or collectively, or any of their Affiliates existing on
the date of this Credit Agreement or arising thereafter, direct or indirect,

Obligations incurred or any of the Notes, Letter of Credit Applications, Letters
of Credit, any Derivative Obligations with any of the Lenders, any Bank Product
Obligations with any of the Lenders, the Agent or any of their Affiliates or
other instruments at any time evidencing any thereof."

         SECTION 2. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 13.4 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

                  (a) Section 13.4(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended
by deleting each reference to the parenthetical "(other than Derivative
Obligations)" in such Section and substituting the parenthetical "(other than
Derivative Obligations and Bank Product Obligations)" in lieu thereof.

                  (b) Section 13.4(c) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended
by deleting such Section in its entirety and substituting the following new
Section 13.4(c) in lieu thereof:

                  "(c) Third, to the Obligations which are Derivative
Obligations and/or Bank Product Obligations, pro rata among the Lenders or their
Affiliates, as the case may be, who are participants in such Derivative

<PAGE>

avoidance of doubt, the Agent and the Lenders confirm and agree that the

of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 5. CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS. This Amendment shall become

hereby) and the other Loan Documents, changes occurring in the ordinary course
of business that singly or in the aggregate do not result in a Material Adverse
Effect and to the extent that such representations and warranties relate
specifically to a prior date.

                  (b) Enforceability. The execution and delivery by each of the
Borrowers of this Amendment, and the performance by each of the Borrowers of
this Amendment and the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, are within the
