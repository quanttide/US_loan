ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

           On December 17, 2004, Independent Wireless One Corporation ("IWO"), a
PCS Affiliate of Sprint wholly-owned by IWO Holdings, Inc. ("IWO Holdings"), and
Sprint Spectrum L.P., Sprint Telephony PCS, L.P. and WirelessCo, L.P.
(collectively, "Sprint") entered into Addendum V to Sprint PCS Management
Agreement and Sprint PCS Services Agreement (the "Addendum"). The Addendum
contains amendments to the Sprint PCS Management Agreement, the Sprint PCS
Services Agreement, the Sprint Trademark and Service Mark License Agreement and
the Sprint Spectrum Trademark and Service Mark License Agreement, each of which
was entered into on February 9, 1999 by IWO and Sprint. Among other changes, the
Addendum modified the fee structure for back office billing and service charges,
new customer activation fees and roaming rates. The new fees will be effective
retroactively to November 1, 2004 and continue through December 31, 2006. The
Addendum also added a most favored nations provision that grants IWO, through
December 31, 2006, the right to amend its Sprint PCS Management and Service
Agreements to obtain the most favorable terms provided to other PCS affiliates
of Sprint of similar size. In addition, the Addendum reduced IWO's network
build-out requirements for certain locations in Vermont, New Hampshire and New
York, substantially lowering IWO's projected capital expenditures to build-out
and service these areas.

           In connection with the Addendum, IWO and IWO Holdings also executed a
Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the "Settlement Agreement") with Sprint
on December 17, 2004, which provides for the settlement of various financial and
contractual disputes between IWO and Sprint, including all previously disputed
charges as of October 31, 2004. The Settlement Agreement also provides for
mutual releases between IWO and IWO Holdings, on the one hand, and Sprint, on
the other hand. The Settlement Agreement and the Addendum are subject to various
conditions prior to their becoming effective, including that IWO Holdings'
previously disclosed restructuring become effective pursuant to a confirmed and
consummated pre-packaged chapter 11 bankruptcy plan of reorganization by no
later than March 15, 2005. The foregoing description of the transactions between
IWO and IWO Holdings and Sprint is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
terms of the Addendum and the Settlement Agreement which are attached hereto as
Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively.
