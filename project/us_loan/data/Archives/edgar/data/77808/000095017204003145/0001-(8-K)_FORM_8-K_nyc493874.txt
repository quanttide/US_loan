ITEM 4.01  CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

     (b)   On December 23, 2004, Petrie Stores Liquidating Trust (the
"Trust") entered into an engagement letter with Weiser LLP pursuant to which
Weiser LLP agreed to serve as the Trust's independent registered public
accounting firm. As previously disclosed in the Trust's Current Report on Form
8-K filed on December 14, 2004 with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), on December 10, 2004, the Trustees of the Trust
approved the engagement of Weiser LLP as the Trust's independent registered
public accounting firm.

           During the two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim
period to date, the Trust has not consulted with Weiser LLP regarding any of
the matters listed in Item 304(a)(2)(i)-(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC.
