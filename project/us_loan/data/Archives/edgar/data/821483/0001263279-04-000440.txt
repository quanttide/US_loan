ITEM 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS

     The following is an update of our operations as of the date of this
Report:

WIND RIVER BASIN

     HOWARD RANCH

     We have drilled our first well, the West Madden 6-27, to a total depth of
15,600 feet and have now completed a 12-stage fracture stimulation of several
Lance sandstones.  The well has been flowing for almost a month and is still
recovering the frac load.  The initial potential of the well is 4.8 million
cubic feet of gas per day (Mmcfgpd), and in the first 15 days it averaged 3.4
Mmcfgpd.  Due to winter stipulations related to federal leasehold, we were
unable to drill the well completely through the Lance section.   Based upon
comparisons of other producing wells in the immediate area, we expect to
access greater thicknesses of productive sands from future wells that are
drilled through the Lance section.

     The initial results of the West Madden 6-27 are very encouraging, and
drilling of an additional well should be underway in early February on a
Wyoming state lease adjacent to our western lease block.  Because the state
lease is not subject to federal stipulations that prohibit access during the
winter months, this will be advantageous to our long-range drilling plans.

SOUTH TEXAS

     NEWTON FIELD

     We have now completed our first development well in the Newton Field.
The Newton B3 well was perforated in 9 different sand intervals in the Upper
Wilcox and stimulated with a 4-stage sand frac.  The well is currently flowing
back and, based on high casing pressures and flow rates, it appears to be as
good or better than initially projected and compares favorably with the Newton
B2, which is the best well in the field.  We have also logged and run
production casing on our second well, the Vastar #5, and log analysis of this
well appears analogous to the Newton B2.  We have now spudded our third well
in the Newton Field.

     SOUTH ANGLETON FIELD

     We just began initial sales from our first well, the Munson #3, and the
well is flowing at a rate of 5.5 Mmcfgpd.  Volumetric calculations and offset
well production suggest this well should ultimately produce as projected.  We
have just finished drilling our second well in the field, the Williamson #8,
and based on log analysis, the anticipated primary zone of interest appears to
be well developed at this location.

PICEANCE BASIN

     VEGA UNIT

     We have fracture stimulated three of four existing wells and, based on
flow tests, results appear comparable to those previously forecast.  We are
currently selling at a restricted rate of 500 thousand cubic feet of gas per
day (Mcfgpd) from only one well until the local gas plant is upgraded to

                                     2



handle our new volumes.  We expect the increased gas plant capacity to become
available by the end of January 2005, after which we can sell unrestricted
volumes.

DJ BASIN

WASHINGTON COUNTY, COLORADO

     We have now drilled 39 wells, including 36 Niobrara wells in which we
have set production casing and 3 Niobrara dry holes that appear to have been
drilled between faults.  Gas gathering infrastructure has been installed to
several of the wells, and we have begun selling some gas.  The rest of the
wells will remain shut-in until our tap into the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline is
installed and operational in late January (estimated date), after which we
will begin a continual series of fracture stimulations to promptly complete
the shut-in wells.  One rig is currently operating in the field, but we plan
to increase the rig count once our existing wells are connected to the
pipeline.  Production contribution from this area will be most apparent in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.  A second phase seismic program is
underway, with 15 square miles being shot in November and December 2004 and
another 35 square miles planned for January 2005.

OTHER UPDATES

     We have made a decision to continue with a fiscal year end of June 30th .
We have been asked by analysts and others to change our fiscal year to a
calendar year in order to make it easier to compare our performance with that
of other companies engaged in similar businesses.  Our management explored the
possibility of changing our fiscal year end immediately, but determined that
such a change would subject us to the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act as of December 31, 2004, rather than at our currently required date
of June 30, 2005.  Our independent registered public accounting firm believes
that if the year end were to be changed at this time, it would be difficult to
accelerate the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley process to complete all of
the requirements imposed under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
including related audit requirements, by December 31, 2004.  Accordingly, we
have decided to continue with the current fiscal year end of June 30th.  In
order to facilitate a comparison of our performance with that of other
companies with a calendar year end, we intend to provide supplemental
unaudited calendar year information in our periodic earnings reports during
the upcoming calendar year.  Our management intends to explore the possibility
of changing our fiscal year to a calendar year during the next twelve months.

                             FUTURE ACTIVITIES UPDATE

     Whereas we earlier indicated plans to issue drilling activities updates
on a monthly basis, we have determined that such a schedule is unrealistic.
Our current plans call for the issuance of drilling activities updates on a
periodic basis, with the specific timing of individual updates to be
determined by the nature and timing of such activities.

     Forward-looking statements in this document are made pursuant to the safe
harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainty, including without limitation, risks that are inherent in oil and
gas exploration and development activities such as dry holes, finding water or
other substances in formations that were expected to be commercially

                                    3



productive based upon available geological and engineering data, mechanical
problems with equipment, etc., the costs of exploring and developing new oil
and natural gas reserves, the price for which such reserves can be sold,
environmental concerns affecting the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, as
well as general market conditions, competition and pricing.  It is possible
that these projections may change as more data becomes available.  Please
refer to our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings for additional
information.
