ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

     On December 17, 2004, Delta Petroleum Corporation ("we" or "our")
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement(the "Agreement") with Manti
Resources, Inc., a Texas corporation, Manti Operating Company, a Texas
corporation, Manti Caballos Creek, LTD., a Texas limited partnership,
Manti Opossum Hollow, LTD., a Texas limited partnership, J&P Oil and
Gas, Inc., a Texas corporation, Lara Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation,
and SofRoc Fuel Co., a Texas corporation (collectively, "Sellers"),
pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase certain oil and gas
properties located in McMullen and Atascosa Counties, Texas.  Two of
the fields subject to the Agreement are currently operated by the
Sellers and, if the transaction is consummated as anticipated, we will
acquire ownership of more than a 90% working interest and assume
operations of both fields.  Based upon our preliminary review, we
believe that the properties to be purchased contain approximately
32.5 Bcfe in proved reserves with additional unproved development
opportunities. The properties currently produce approximately a net
12,000 Mcfe per day. The effective date of the sale would be
December 1, 2004.

     The purchase price for the assets is to be approximately $63
million in cash, subject to certain adjustments.  In connection with
the execution of the Agreement, we have paid the Sellers a deposit
of $3 million toward the purchase price.  We intend to fund the
remainder of the acquisition cost through borrowings under our
existing credit facility.

     The closing of the Agreement is subject to customary closing
conditions, the timely resolution of any title defects, the results
of any environmental audit, etc.  The Agreement provides that the
closing will occur on or before January 21, 2005.


                                  SIGNATURE

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by
the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

                                      DELTA PETROLEUM CORPORATION
                                      (Registrant)


Date:  December 21, 2004               By:/s/ Kevin K. Nanke

                                          and Chief Financial Officer
