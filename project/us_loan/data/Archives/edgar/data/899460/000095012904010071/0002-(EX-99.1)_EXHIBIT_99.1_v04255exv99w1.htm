<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>MannKind Reports Positive Data from its US Phase 2b Clinical Trial of
Technosphere<SUP><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#226;</FONT></SUP> Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Commences First Phase 3
Clinical Trial in Europe</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Valencia, California </B>(December&nbsp;22, 2004) &#150; <B>MannKind Corporation (Nasdaq: MNKD) </B>released summary
information today on results from its US-based, late Phase 2 clinical study of
Technosphere<SUP><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#226;</FONT></SUP> Insulin, a pulmonary insulin formulation delivered via its
proprietary inhaler to patients with diabetes mellitus. The MannKind pulmonary insulin system
rapidly delivers regular human insulin to the bloodstream in a manner that approximates the first
phase insulin release spike by the pancreas that occurs almost immediately after the start of a
meal in normal, healthy individuals but is lost in patients who develop diabetes. This spike plays
an important role in glucose control by signaling the liver to stop releasing glucose into the
bloodstream while glucose is being ingested from a meal.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 21 sites in the United States.
Patients who participated in the study were experiencing inadequate control of diabetes determined
on the basis of HbA1c results (a measure of glucose control over the preceding three to four
months) obtained at the time of screening. All patients received basic diabetes education and
performed regular monitoring of blood glucose levels at home prior to randomization. A total of
123 patients (41 women and 82 men) were randomized into either a group that inhaled Technosphere
Insulin (doses containing 6 to 48 units of insulin) or Technosphere placebo, in both cases at
mealtimes. One hundred seven patients completed the full 12&nbsp;weeks of treatment with blinded study
agents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Patients that constituted the primary efficacy population (n=90) had a mean HbA1c level of 7.74% at
baseline with a range of 6.6% to 10.5%. As part of the study analysis plan, these patients were
evaluated in two groups: those with moderately severe elevations of HbA1c levels at baseline of
8.0% and above (values identified by the American Diabetes Association as requiring definitive
therapeutic intervention to minimize complications) and those with mild- to moderate elevations of
HbA1c levels at baseline ranging from 6.6% to 7.9%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Patients with moderately severe elevations of HbA1c levels at baseline (n=35; mean HbA1c 8.72%;
range 8.0% to 10.5%), who were treated with Technosphere Insulin, experienced a mean reduction of
1.37&nbsp;percentage points by the end of 12&nbsp;weeks of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">treatment. The difference in reduction of HbA1c levels between the Technosphere Insulin and the
placebo treatment groups was highly statistically significant (p=0.0007) in favor of Technosphere
Insulin.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Patients with mild to moderate elevations of HbA1c levels at baseline (n=55; mean HbA1c 7.18%;
range 6.6% to 7.9%), who were treated with Technosphere Insulin, experienced a mean reduction of
0.43&nbsp;percentage points by the end of 12&nbsp;weeks of treatment. The difference in reduction of HbA1c
levels between the Technosphere Insulin and the placebo treatment groups was statistically
significant (p=0.0447) in favor of Technosphere Insulin.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Overall, in the primary efficacy population, there was a highly statistically significant
difference between the two treatment groups (in favor of the Technosphere Insulin group) with
respect to the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in HbA1c levels by the goal of at
least 0.6&nbsp;percentage points (chi-square; p=0.0052). Approximately four times as many patients in
the Technosphere Insulin-treated group achieved a final HbA1c level of 6.5% or less as compared to
the placebo-treated group.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">There were no serious adverse events that were related to the use of the study drug<B>. </B>No episodes
of severe hypoglycemia occurred in any of the patients treated with Technosphere Insulin.
Pulmonary function was assessed by DLco measurements, FVC and FEV1 rates, and there was no
clinically significant difference between the 12-week test results and baseline values in the
patient group receiving Technosphere Insulin. Importantly, there was also no evidence of
treatment-induced insulin antibodies occurring in patients treated with Technosphere Insulin.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Dr.&nbsp;Wendell Cheatham, Corporate Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of MannKind, commented,
&#147;This study indicates that Technosphere Insulin can effectively lower blood glucose levels in
patients with type 2 diabetes who previously were experiencing inadequate control of their disease.
The typical risks of frequent or severe hypoglycemia associated with insulin therapy appear to be
minimal with Technosphere Insulin, giving it a potentially significant safety advantage over other
therapies.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Alfred Mann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MannKind, stated further, &#147;In our earlier
clinical studies, we observed that the kinetic profile of Technosphere Insulin approximates the first
phase insulin release spike of normal, healthy individuals. With these latest observations of no
increases in antibodies, no clinically significant changes in pulmonary function and no episodes of
severe hypoglycemia in patients treated with Technosphere Insulin, we continue to be optimistic
regarding the future of Technosphere Insulin. We are now preparing to submit these results to the
United States Food and Drug Administration. In the meantime, we have initiated our first Phase 3
clinical trial in Europe, enrolling patients this week. We are pleased that the Company continues
to achieve its intended milestones on or ahead of schedule.&#148;
