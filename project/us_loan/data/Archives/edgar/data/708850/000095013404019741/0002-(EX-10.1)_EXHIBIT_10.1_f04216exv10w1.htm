<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (this &#147;Amendment&#148;) is entered into as of
December&nbsp;1, 2004, by and between DIONEX CORPORATION, a California corporation (&#147;Borrower&#148;), and
WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (&#147;Bank&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>RECITALS</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Borrower is currently indebted to Bank pursuant to the terms and conditions of that
Credit Agreement between Borrower and Bank dated as of November&nbsp;13, 2000, as amended from time to
time (&#147;Credit Agreement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Bank and Borrower have agreed to certain changes in the terms and conditions set
forth in the Credit Agreement and have agreed to amend the Credit Agreement to reflect said
changes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree that the Credit Agreement shall be amended as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.1 (a)&nbsp;is hereby amended by deleting &#147;December&nbsp;31, 2004&#148; as the last day on which
Bank will make advances under the Line of Credit, and by substituting for said date &#147;December&nbsp;31,
2006,&#148; with such change to be effective upon the execution and delivery to Bank of a promissory
note substantially in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A attached hereto (which promissory note shall replace
and be deemed the Line of Credit Note defined in and made pursuant to the Credit Agreement) and all
other contracts, instruments and documents required by Bank to evidence such change.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.2. (a)&nbsp;is hereby deleted in its entirety, and the following substituted therefor:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Standby Letter of Credit</U>. Bank has issued or cause an affiliate to issue a
standby letter of credit for the account of Borrower and for the benefit of the former shareholders
of LC Packing (the &#147;Standby Letter of Credit&#148;) in the principal amount of Three Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,5000,000.00). The Standby Letter of Credit has an expiration date of
January&nbsp;31, 2005, and is subject to the additional terms of the Letter of Credit agreement,
application and any related documents required by Bank in connection with the issuance thereof (the
&#147;Letter of Credit Agreement&#148;). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Bank hereby
confirms that the Standby Letter of Credit remains in full force and effect.&#148;
