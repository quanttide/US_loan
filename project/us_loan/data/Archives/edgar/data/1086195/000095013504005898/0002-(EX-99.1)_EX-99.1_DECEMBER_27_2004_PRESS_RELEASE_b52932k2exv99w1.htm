<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ATG COMPLETES INITIAL INTEGRATION OF PRIMUS<BR>
KNOWLEDGE SOLUTIONS, INC.; UPDATES FY2005 GUIDANCE</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Company Expects Profitability and Cash Flow Positive Performance for 2005 on Revenues of $90-$100<BR>
Million; Lowers Spending for 2005 on Increased Cost Synergies Related to the Acquisition</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &#150; December&nbsp;27, 2004 &#150; </B>ATG (Art Technology Group, Inc., NASDAQ: ARTG) today
announced that the company has completed its initial integration of Primus Knowledge Solutions,
Inc. (Primus). As a result, the company has updated its guidance for 2005. The company expects
revenues for 2005 will be in the range of $90&nbsp;million to $100&nbsp;million. The company continues to
anticipate that it will be profitable and cash flow positive for the full year 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">ATG expects total spending for 2005, excluding amortization of intangibles, in the range of $85
million to $86&nbsp;million. This $1&nbsp;million to $2&nbsp;million improvement from previous guidance is due to
additional synergies associated with the Primus acquisition principally related to increased
headcount reductions, which have already occurred, and a greater anticipated benefit from
facilities consolidation. Upon completion of the integration, ATG anticipates that its headcount
will be approximately 350 people compared with a combined headcount of approximately 475 people as
of June&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;I am pleased to report that our integration is progressing on schedule and that our efforts to
achieve cost synergies have gone better than expected,&#148; said Bob Burke, ATG&#146;s president and chief
executive officer. &#147;As a result, I am confident that ATG will achieve year-over-year revenue
growth in 2005, as well as be profitable and cash flow positive. We continue to see benefits from
the strategic fit of the two companies within our respective customer bases. Primus is meaningfully
contributing to our business pipeline, and we already have joint selling opportunities. With new
products like ATG Outreach and the integration of best-in-class technologies from ATG and Primus,
we believe that we can drive revenue growth in 2005 and beyond. With the recent announcement of our
transaction with American Eagle Outfitters, it is clear that we are gaining traction with commerce
and service solutions.&#148;
