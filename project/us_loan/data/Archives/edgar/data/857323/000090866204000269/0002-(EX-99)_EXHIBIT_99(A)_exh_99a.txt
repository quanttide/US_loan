WEST  GREENWICH,  RI - (December 21, 2004) - GTECH Holdings  Corporation  (NYSE:
GTK) today announced third quarter  earnings for fiscal year 2005 ended November
27, 2004.

"GTECH enjoyed a solid and productive third quarter. We met both our revenue and
earnings  targets,  and  we  made  significant  progress  towards  ensuring  our
continued  long-term growth," said GTECH President and CEO W. Bruce Turner. "Our
business  was strong,  leading to a number of key wins around the world.  On the
operational side, we continued to improve the efficiency of our business, and we
furthered  our  strategic  progress  in  both  Commercial  Services  and  Gaming
Solutions with the announcements of two solid acquisitions."

"We are pleased with the  continued  strength of our business and excited  about
the future," said GTECH Senior Vice President and CFO Jaymin B. Patel.  "At this
stage of the planning  process,  we are comfortable  that the outlook for fiscal
2006 is shaping up well,  giving us confidence  that we remain on track in terms
of achieving our long-term goals for growth,  profitability,  and value creation
for our shareholders."


Operating Results
- -----------------

Earnings  and  dividends  per share for the three and nine month  periods of the
prior year have been restated to reflect the 2-for-1 common stock split effected
in the form of a stock  dividend,  which was  distributed  on July 30, 2004,  to
shareholders of record as of July 1, 2004.

Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $315.6 million, up 23.8% over
revenues of $254.9  million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.  Net income was
$45.9 million,  or $0.35 per diluted  share,  comparable to the same period last
year.

Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 were $919.4 million,  up 19.1%
over  revenues of $771.8  million in the first nine months of fiscal  2004.  Net
income was $152.6 million,  or $1.16 per diluted share, up 12.7% over net income
of $135.4  million,  or $1.06 per diluted share,  for the same period last year.
Net income in the first nine  months of fiscal  2005  includes a net,  one-time,
after-tax  gain of $6.5  million,  or  approximately  $0.05 per  diluted  share,
associated  with the sale of the Company's 50% interest in Gaming  Entertainment
(Delaware)  L.L.C.,  net of charges  associated with the early retirement of the
remainder of the Company's 2007 private placement notes. Net income in the first
nine months of fiscal 2004 includes a one-time,  after-tax gain of $3.3 million,
or  approximately  $0.03  per  diluted  share,  from  the  consolidation  of the
partnership  that owns the Company's  corporate  headquarters in West Greenwich,
Rhode Island.


Cash Flow and Investments
- -------------------------

During  the first nine  months of fiscal  2005,  the  Company  generated  $278.5
million of cash from  operations.  This cash,  along with cash  generated by the
sale of available-for-sale  investment securities,  was principally used to fund
the Spielo Manufacturing Incorporated,  Leeward Islands Lottery Holding Company,
Inc.,  and  BillBird  S.A.  acquisitions  of $200.8  million  and to fund $189.4
million of  systems,  equipment,  and other  assets  relating to  contracts.  In
addition,  the Company  issued  $300  million of Senior  Notes  during the third
quarter of fiscal 2005;  repaid the  remaining  $90.0  million of the  Company's
7.87% Senior  Notes;  repurchased  $100.5  million,  or 4,409,500  shares of the
Company's  common stock;  and paid cash dividends of $30.0 million.  At November
27, 2004, the Company had $309.6  million of cash and cash  equivalents on hand,
which  includes  the net  proceeds  from the  issuance of $300 million of Senior
Notes.

During the fiscal 2005 third  quarter,  GTECH  entered  into a new $500  million
senior  revolving  credit  facility.  The new credit  facility is unsecured  and
matures in October 2009. At the end of the current fiscal quarter,  GTECH had no
borrowings under the credit facility.


Financial Outlook
- -----------------

The Company also updated the guidance for fiscal year ending February 26, 2005.

The Company continues to expect total revenue growth of approximately  19%, with
service  revenue  growth in the range of 6% to 7%. The Company  expects  product
sales to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million.

The Company expects service margins to be approximately  40% and product margins
in the range of 34% to 36%.

Based on the current operational  outlook,  GTECH now expects earnings per share
for  fiscal  year 2005 to be in the  range of $1.46 to $1.48 on a  fully-diluted
basis, rather than the previously announced $1.43 to $1.48 per share.

Earnings  per diluted  share for the fourth  quarter  are  expected to be in the
range of $0.31 to $0.33.

For fiscal year 2006,  ending  February 25, 2006,  the Company  expects  service
revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9%,  reflecting a 5% to 6% increase in same
store  sales,  the net effect of contract  wins and the impact of  acquisitions,
offset by a number of factors, including contractual rate changes.

The Company expects product sales in the range of $215 million to $235 million.

The Company expects service margins of approximately  40% and product margins in
the range of 37% to 39%.

Based upon the preliminary outlook, the Company believes that earnings per share
will be in the range of $1.53 to $1.58 for fiscal year 2006.


Third Quarter Highlights
- ------------------------

In the third  quarter  of fiscal  year 2005,  GTECH  continued  to  successfully
execute against the Company's strategic  objectives of maintaining and expanding
the  core  lottery  business,  winning  new  customers,  and  growing  perimeter
businesses.

Domestically,  GTECH signed a three-year  contract  extension with the Minnesota
State Lottery  commencing in February 2008. The Colorado Lottery granted GTECH a
90-day extension,  which commenced November 1, 2004, in order to provide the new
vendor  additional  time to convert  the  system.  Lotteries  in Arizona and New
Mexico also extended GTECH's Instant Ticket Vending Machine (ITVM) contracts for
three and two years, respectively.

Outside of the U.S., GTECH signed a new six-year integrated services contract in
Mexico with Pronosticos para la Asistencia Publica.  In addition,  GTECH's joint
venture in Thailand,  LOXLEY GTECH  Technology Co. Ltd., was named the preferred
bidder for a national online  lottery.  In Finland,  GTECH's  lottery  customer,
Veikkaus  Oy,  selected  the  Company  to  provide  a new  interactive  software
solution,  central  system,  and  terminals.  Societe de la Loterie de la Suisse
Romande chose GTECH for a new integrated  online and instant  ticket system,  as
well as new  terminals  and a wireless  communications  network.  GTECH was also
selected by Atlantic Lottery  Corporation for a new video lottery central system
and ongoing services.

Singapore  Pools  PTY  Ltd.  signed  a  five-year  contract  with  GTECH  for ES
Connect(TM),  which will enable the existing  lottery system to support internet
protocol (IP) networks and IP lottery terminals. In addition, GTECH will provide
Singapore Pools with ES Connect(TM) B2B,  providing an interface for third-party
systems.

"Our successes  throughout  this year,  combined with our ongoing  commitment to
improving  efficiencies,  our increased financial  flexibility,  and the prudent
investment of shareholder  capital have  positioned us for continued  success in
fiscal 2006," said Mr. Turner.

Also in the quarter, GTECH's majority-owned  subsidiary,  PolCard, completed the
acquisition of privately-held  BillBird S.A., the leading provider of electronic
bill payment services in Poland,  making GTECH the Commercial Services leader in
Poland.

After the close of the quarter,  GTECH  announced it was  acquiring a 50 percent
controlling  equity  position in the  Atronic  group of  companies  owned by the
Gauselmann  Group,  based in Germany.  Atronic is one of the five  largest  slot
machine makers  globally,  and is a market leader in Europe,  Russia,  and Latin
America, with a solid presence in the United States.

Also after the close of the quarter,  GTECH was awarded a seven-year  integrated
services  contract to supply new equipment and services to the Missouri Lottery,
and    signed    an     agreement     with    its     customer    in    Germany,
Lotterie-Treuhandgesellschaft  mbH  Thuringen,  for a  new  central  system  and
terminals.

Earlier  today,  GTECH  announced  it was  selected by the  Multi-State  Lottery
Association (MUSL) to supply equipment,  software,  services, and communications
network for the first ever  multi-vendor,  multi-state  video  lottery Wide Area
Progressive (WAP) solution.
