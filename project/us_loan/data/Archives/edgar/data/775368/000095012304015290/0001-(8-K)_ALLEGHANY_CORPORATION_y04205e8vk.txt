Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

       On December 23, 2004, Alleghany Corporation entered into a definitive
agreement providing for the merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Heads &

vehicle formed by a private investor group led by Heads & Threads management and
by Capital Partners, Inc. Heads & Threads International LLC is engaged in the
industrial fasteners business. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
Alleghany will receive merger consideration of approximately $55 million in

International LLC on the closing date. The merger is expected to close on
December 31, 2004 and is subject to customary closing conditions.

       The foregoing description of the merger agreement does not purport to be
