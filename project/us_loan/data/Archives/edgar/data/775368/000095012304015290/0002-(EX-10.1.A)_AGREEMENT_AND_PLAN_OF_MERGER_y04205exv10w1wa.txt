Acquisition and the Board of Directors and the sole member of the Company have
approved this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into HTI

Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

                  2.1 The Merger. In accordance with the Limited Liability
Company Act of the State of Delaware ("DLLCA"), at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into HTI Acquisition. As a result of the

State (or such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the DLLCA with the written consent of HTI Acquisition
and Alleghany) being the "Effective Time").
<PAGE>
                  2.4 Certificate of formation; Limited Liability Company
Agreement. At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of
HTI Acquisition, the Company, Alleghany or the Surviving Entity:

                  (A) The certificate of formation of HTI Acquisition, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended as a result of
the Merger to change the name of the Surviving Entity to "Heads & Threads
International LLC". The certificate of formation of HTI Acquisition as so
amended shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Entity following
the Merger, until thereafter further amended or repealed in accordance with its
terms and as provided under the DLLCA.

                  (B) The limited liability company agreement of HTI
Acquisition, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity following the
Merger, until thereafter amended or repealed in accordance with its terms, the
terms of the certificate of formation of the Surviving Entity and as provided
under the DLLCA.

                  2.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of HTI Acquisition
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Entity following the Merger, and the officers of HTI Acquisition
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Entity following the Merger, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of formation and
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity and as provided
under the DLLCA.

                  2.6 Employment Agreements. Simultaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, HTI Acquisition and each of the parties thereto
are entering into employment agreements in the forms of Exhibit B-1, B-2 and B-3
(the "New Employment Agreements"). Each of the New Employment Agreements by its
terms will take effect at the Effective Time.

                  2.7 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and in the DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of HTI Acquisition and the Company

of HTI Acquisition and the Company shall attach to the Surviving Entity, and the
Surviving Entity shall continue its existence under the DLLCA.

Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
HTI Acquisition, the Company, Alleghany, the Surviving Entity or any holder of
any membership interests in HTI Acquisition or any membership interests in the
Company:


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>
                  (A) Membership Interests in HTI Acquisition. All of the
membership interests in HTI Acquisition outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding.

                  (B) Conversion of Membership Interests in the Company into
Right to Receive Merger Consideration. All of the membership interests in the
Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted
into the right to receive $54,656,000 in cash (the "Unadjusted Merger
Consideration"), which amount is equal to the Member's Equity in the Company as
set forth on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as at November 30, 2004 referred to in Section 4.6, subject
to adjustment as set forth in Section 3.2. At the Closing, HTI Acquisition shall
pay the Unadjusted Merger Consideration to Alleghany by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. In addition, at the Closing, HTI Acquisition shall
cause the Alleghany Debt and the LaSalle Debt to be repaid in full. As of the
Effective Time, all membership interests in the Company shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to be outstanding and exist.

                  3.2 Post-Closing Adjustment of Unadjusted Merger
Consideration.

                  (A) Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, Alleghany
shall prepare a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Company Subsidiaries as of the time immediately preceding the Effective Time (as
it may be audited or changed below, the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied in a manner
consistent with the application of such principles in the preparation of the
December 31, 2003 Balance Sheet, except for the absence of footnote disclosures
and other financial statements required thereby. Alleghany and HTI Acquisition
agree that except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement, the Closing Date
Balance Sheet will not give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (B) The parties agree that the Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall give effect to (i) the deferred Tax assets, without giving effect to any
valuation allowance therefor, (ii) any Taxes to be refunded or recovered, (iii)
completion bonuses paid to officers or employees of the Company at or prior to
the Closing ("Completion Bonuses") to the extent that such Completion Bonuses
are paid by the Company, (iv) accruals made for periods prior to the Closing in
respect of the Company's 2004 annual incentive plans, (v) the transfer and
assignment of the Transferred Assets from the Company to Alleghany and (vi) the
transfer from the Company to Alleghany and the acceptance and assumption by
Alleghany of the Transferred Liabilities. The parties agree that the Closing
Date Balance Sheet shall not give effect to (i) any current Income Tax expense,
(ii) the termination of the Tax Sharing Agreement, (iii) any Completion Bonuses
paid by Alleghany, (iv) the repayment by HTI Acquisition of the Alleghany Debt
and the LaSalle Debt, (v) the New Employment Agreements, or (vi) the termination
of the Existing Employment Agreements.

                  (C) Alleghany shall cause the Closing Date Balance Sheet to be
audited by KPMG LLP or such other firm of certified independent public
accountants of national reputation mutually agreed to by all of the parties (the
"Designated Accountants") and shall cause the Designated Accountants to issue
and deliver the Closing Date Balance Sheet, as so

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>
audited, to Alleghany and to HTI Acquisition within sixty (60) days after the
Effective Date. Total assets less total liabilities as shown on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date Book Value." The
parties agree that the fees and expenses of the Designated Accountants in
connection with the preparation of the audited Closing Date Balance Sheet shall
be paid by Alleghany, and that, in the event HTI Acquisition engages the
Designated Accountants to assist in its review of the audited Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the fees and expenses of the Designated Accountants in connection
with such review shall be paid by HTI Acquisition.

                  (D) During the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
by Alleghany as provided in Section 3.2(A) hereof, HTI Acquisition shall (i)
provide Alleghany and its representatives with reasonable access to all relevant
books, records and work papers in the possession of HTI Acquisition and all
former employees of the Company employed by HTI Acquisition, (ii) cooperate with
Alleghany and its representatives, including providing all information in the
possession of HTI Acquisition necessary or useful in the preparation of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, and (iii) be entitled to observe and review the
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the audit, including the
Designated Accountants' work papers, and shall have full access to the
Designated Accountants during such audit, which review shall not constitute any
approval of or acquiescence in the Closing Date Balance Sheet on the part of HTI
Acquisition. In order to prepare the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Alleghany shall
cause the Company to conduct a physical count of the inventory (including raw
materials, finished goods and work-in-progress) of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries during the period from December 28, 2004
through December 31, 2004, or at such other time prior to the Closing as may be
mutually agreed to by all of the parties. Alleghany will roll forward the value
of such inventory, based on the purchases and use of such inventory from the
date of such physical count through the time immediately preceding the Effective
Time, to value the inventory of the Company and its consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as at the time immediately preceding the Effective Time. HTI
Acquisition and its representatives shall be entitled to participate in such
physical count.

                  (E) In the event that the Closing Date Book Value is greater
than the Unadjusted Merger Consideration, then HTI Acquisition shall pay to
Alleghany an amount equal to the difference. In the event that the Closing Date
Book Value is less than the Unadjusted Merger Consideration, then Alleghany
shall pay to HTI Acquisition an amount equal to the difference.

                  (F) In the event that HTI Acquisition does not disagree with
the Closing Date Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 3.2(G), then the payment to
be made pursuant to Section 3.2(E) shall be made in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day after the
delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet as provided in Section 3.2(A).

                  (G) In the event that HTI Acquisition disagrees with the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, HTI Acquisition shall in writing advise Alleghany
within forty-five (45) days after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet as
provided in Section 3.2(A), specifying the nature of all such disagreements, the
reason therefor and its calculation of the amount of the payment it believes is
required by Section 3.2(E). HTI Acquisition may object to the Closing

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>
Date Balance Sheet only to the extent that such Closing Date Balance Sheet was
not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied
in a manner consistent with the application of such principles in the
preparation of the December 31, 2003 Balance Sheet. HTI Acquisition specifically
agrees that it will not object to the inclusion of the deferred Tax asset on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet as a result of the utilization of net operating
losses generated by the Company in the federal Consolidated Income Tax Return of
the affiliated group of which Alleghany is the common parent. HTI Acquisition
and Alleghany shall attempt to resolve all such disagreements. If HTI
Acquisition and Alleghany are unable to resolve all such disagreements within
fifteen (15) days after HTI Acquisition shall have advised Alleghany of such
disagreements, HTI Acquisition and Alleghany shall then select a mutually
acceptable firm of certified independent public accountants of national
reputation (the "Independent Accountants") to resolve the disagreements and to
determine the amount of the payment required by Section 3.2(E) (the "Revised
Amount"). The Independent Accountants shall deliver their determination of the
Revised Amount to HTI Acquisition and Alleghany as soon as practicable and such
determination shall be final and binding upon HTI Acquisition and Alleghany.
Payment of the Revised Amount shall be made in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of the
determination of the Revised Amount as provided in this Section 3.2(G).

                  (H) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall
be shared equally by HTI Acquisition and Alleghany.

                  3.3 Tax Treatment and Allocation. Alleghany and HTI
Acquisition agree to treat the Merger as a sale of the assets of the Company and
Heads & Threads (PA) (other than the Transferred Assets) for all Tax purposes,
Alleghany intends to treat such sale as followed by the deemed distribution to
Alleghany of the Transferred Assets and the assumption by Alleghany of the
Transferred Liabilities in a completed liquidation of the Company pursuant to
Section 332 of the Code, and Alleghany and HTI Acquisition agree not to take any
contrary position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) unless required
to do so pursuant to a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of
the Code. HTI Acquisition shall prepare and deliver to Alleghany an allocation
of the Unadjusted Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2(E)
(the "Merger Consideration"), any assumed liabilities of the Company, and all
other capitalized costs, among the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in accordance with their respective fair market values pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, no later
than ninety (90) days after the determination of the Revised Amount pursuant to
Section 3.2(G), or, if HTI Acquisition does not disagree with the Closing Date
Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 3.2(G), no later than ninety (90) days after
the delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet as provided in Section 3.2(A)
(the "Allocation"). The parties hereto agree to consult in good faith regarding
the Allocation, and HTI Acquisition shall make such changes to the Allocation as
are reasonably requested by Alleghany; provided that Alleghany will accept HTI
Acquisition's determination of the Allocation provided such determination is
reasonable and consistent with applicable law. The parties shall report the sale
and purchase of the assets of the Company and Heads & Threads (PA) (other than
the Transferred Assets) on all Tax Returns (including, without limitation,
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the Allocation
as finally determined, unless required to do otherwise pursuant to a final
determination within the

                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code. The parties agree to consult with one
another with respect to any Tax audit, controversy or litigation relating to the
Allocation.

                  (C) The facilities, machinery, furniture, office and other
equipment used in the operation of the Business, taken as a whole, are in
commercially reasonable operating condition and repair, taking into account
their current use, age and ordinary wear and tear. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN, ALL OF THE
TANGIBLE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY ARE SOLD TO PURCHASER "WHEREAS" AND "AS IS"
WITHOUT IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR INTENDED USE OR
OTHERWISE.

                  4.10 Certain Properties. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary owns any real estate. Schedule 4.10 sets forth all of the real
property leased to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and specifies the
location of each property, the use of the facility thereon, the name of the
owner or the names of the lessor and the lessee, and the approximate square
footage of improvements which are leased, as specified in each lease. The
Company and Alleghany have delivered to HTI Acquisition (i) a copy of each lease
by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary acquired its interest in the real
estate described in Schedule 4.10 and (ii) to the extent in the possession of
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or Alleghany, a copy of all
certificates of occupancy for the improvements on the real estate described in
Schedule 4.10 and a copy of any variance granted with respect to any of such
real estate described in Schedule 4.10, all of which documents are true and
complete copies thereof as in effect on the date hereof, except as may otherwise
be set forth in Schedule 4.10. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
nor Alleghany has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any of the real estate described in Schedule 4.10 alleging a
violation of Applicable Law which is the responsibility of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to cure under a lease and which has not been cured.
Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10 there is no sublease, occupancy agreement
or like instrument to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
with respect to any of the real estate described in Schedule 4.10. Each lease
pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary leases any real property
is in full force and effect and, to the Company's knowledge, is valid and
enforceable in accordance with its terms. There is not under any such lease any
default by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with regard to the payment of
rent or any other material default including, without limitation, any default
that could be a basis for termination of the lease. To the Company's Knowledge,
there is no other default under any such lease by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, nor has there occurred any event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would constitute such a default by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. To the Company's Knowledge, there is not under any such lease any
default by any other party thereto or any event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute such a default thereunder by such party.

                  4.11 Taxes. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11:

                  (A) For all periods of its ownership of the Company during
which the Company was treated as a corporation for Income Tax purposes,
Alleghany has included (or, with respect to the taxable year including the
Closing Date, will include) the Company and any of its corporate Company
Subsidiaries in its federal Consolidated Income Tax Return as a member of the
affiliated group of which Alleghany is the common parent.

<PAGE>
                  (B) All material Tax Returns required to have been filed on or
before the Closing Date by or with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary have been duly and timely filed (or, if due between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, will be duly and timely filed), and all Taxes shown as due
on any such Tax Return have been duly and timely paid (or, if due between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, will be duly and timely paid). Each state
Income Tax Return and each Non-Income Tax Return filed by or with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary was true, correct and complete in all material
respects as of the time of its filing or after taking into account any changes
reflected on any amended Tax Returns.

                  (C) The accrued but unpaid Non-Income Taxes of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries did not, as of September 30, 2004, exceed the provision
for Non-Income Tax liability set forth on the face of the September 30, 2004
Balance Sheet (rather than any notes thereto). Notwithstanding any statement on
Schedule 4.11 or any other Schedule hereto, the Non-Income Taxes of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries that will have accrued (in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements) but not been paid for taxable periods and portions thereof up to and
including the Closing Date will not exceed the provision for Non-Income Taxes of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required
to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, former employee, creditor, independent contractor, shareholder,
Affiliate, customer, supplier or other third party.

                  (D) There is no dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary claimed or raised in writing by any
Taxing Authority. No issues have been raised in writing in any examination by
any Taxing Authority with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary which
by application of similar principles reasonably could be expected to result in a
proposed deficiency for any period not so examined. The Company has delivered to
HTI Acquisition complete and correct copies of (i) all of the relevant Income
Tax schedules, forms and information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, complete in all respects, to permit their inclusion in the
Consolidated Income Tax Returns of Alleghany (but not the Consolidated Income
Tax Returns of Alleghany) and (ii) all state, local and foreign Income Tax
Returns filed by, and all Tax examination reports and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by, the Company or any Company Subsidiary since
January 1, 2001.

                  (E) There are no outstanding written requests, agreements,
consents or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations applicable to
the assessment of any Taxes against the Company or any Company Subsidiary. None
of the assets or properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary constitute
tax-exempt bond financed property or tax-exempt use property, within the meaning
of Section 168 of the Code. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party to any "safe harbor lease" that is subject to the provisions of Section
168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act
of 1986. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party to any joint
venture, partnership or other arrangement that is treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes.

                  (F) Except as shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10.2(B),
none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement
providing for the

                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>
allocation or sharing of Taxes. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has received or is subject to any written ruling of a Taxing Authority related
to Taxes or has entered into any written and legally binding agreement with a
Taxing Authority relating to Taxes. None of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any liability for Taxes of any Person or entity (i) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law, other than in respect of Alleghany and the Company Subsidiaries,
(ii) as a transferee or successor, (iii) by contract or (iv) otherwise.

                  (G) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.11, there are no liens
for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for
liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and liens for Taxes that are being
contested in good faith that are adequately reserved for on the Financial
Statements.

                  (H) The Company has been a properly treated as a corporation
for federal income tax purposes since January 1, 2000. Heads & Threads (PA) has
been disregarded as an entity separate from the Company for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, within the meaning of Section 301.7701-3(b)(ii) of the Treasury
regulations throughout the entire period of its existence. Heads & Threads
(Mexico) (LLC) and the Mexican Company Subsidiaries are corporations for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

            5. Representations and Warranties by HTI Acquisition. HTI
Acquisition represents and warrants to the Company and Alleghany as follows:

                  5.1 Organization. HTI Acquisition is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has the power and authority to carry on the business
now being conducted by the Company and to acquire and own and operate the
properties, assets and business of the Company. HTI Acquisition has delivered to
Alleghany complete and correct copies of the Certificate of formation and
limited liability agreement of HTI Acquisition as in effect on the date hereof.

                  5.2 Authority. HTI Acquisition has the power to enter into
this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of
Managers of HTI Acquisition and by its members and no other proceeding on the
part of HTI Acquisition is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered on behalf of HTI Acquisition, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

binding obligation of HTI Acquisition enforceable against HTI Acquisition in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by
general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  5.3 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby (i) will violate or conflict with the
certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of HTI
Acquisition, (ii) will result in any breach of or default under any provision of
any loan agreement, real property lease or other material agreement of any kind
to which HTI Acquisition is a party or by which HTI Acquisition is bound or to
which any property or asset of HTI Acquisition is subject and (iii) except for
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, is
prohibited by or requires HTI Acquisition to obtain or make any consent,
authorization, approval, registration or filing under any Applicable Law to
which HTI Acquisition is subject, or to which any property or asset of HTI
Acquisition is subject, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the ability of HTI Acquisition to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                  5.4 Litigation. There are no actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations, either at law or in equity, by or before any commission or other
administrative authority in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction, or
before any arbitration panel, of any kind pending or, to the Knowledge of HTI
Acquisition, threatened against HTI Acquisition or any of its properties or
assets that, if asserted and decided adversely to HTI Acquisition, would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the ability of HTI Acquisition to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

                  5.5 HSR Act. No Person "controls" HTI Acquisition within the
meaning of the HSR Act. For purposes of the "size-of-the-parties" test under the
HSR Act, HTI Acquisition has less than $10,000,000 in total assets and less than
$10,000,000 in annual sales, and no requirements of the HSR Act apply to the
acquisition of the Company by HTI Acquisition provided for hereunder.

                  5.6 Financing. HTI Acquisition has delivered to Alleghany (i)
true, correct and complete signed counterpart(s) of commitment letters (the
"Equity Commitment Letters"), dated on or prior to the date hereof, whereby the
parties thereto (the "Equity Investors") have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to make or cause to be made in HTI Holding equity
investments in cash in the aggregate amount of not less than $25,000,000 (the
"Equity Commitment"); (ii) a true, correct and complete signed counterpart of a
letter agreement by and between HTI Holding and HTI Acquisition, dated on or
prior to the date hereof, whereby HTI Holding has agreed to contribute the
entire Equity Commitment to HTI Acquisition (the "Contribution Letter"); and
(iii) true, correct and complete signed counterpart(s) of commitment letter(s),
dated on or prior to the date hereof, pursuant to which


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

the lenders party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to provided or cause to be provided debt financing in connection
with the transactions provided for herein and revolving credit to HTI
Acquisition (the "Commitment Letters" and, together with the Equity Commitment
Letters and the Contribution Letter, the "Commitments"). The Commitments have
not been amended in a manner that would be prohibited by the last sentence of
this Section 5.6 and are, to the Knowledge of HTI Acquisition, in full force and
effect. The Commitments are subject to no contingencies or conditions other than
those set forth in the copies of the Commitments delivered to Alleghany. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Commitments, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Commitments would provide HTI Acquisition with
acquisition financing at the Effective Time sufficient to consummate the Merger
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement (the "Acquisition Financing").
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit HTI Acquisition or the Equity
Investors from entering into agreements relating to the financing or the
operation of HTI Acquisition or the Surviving Equity, including adding other
equity providers or operating partners; provided that (i) the aggregate amount
of the Equity Commitment shall not be reduced in any way to less than
$25,000,000 and (ii) HTI Acquisition shall have obtained any and all required
consents of the lenders under the Commitment Letters.

                  5.7 Interim Operations of HTI Acquisition. HTI Acquisition was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. HTI Acquisition has not owned, operated or conducted and, prior
to the Effective Time, will not own, operate or conduct any businesses or
activities other than in connection with its organization, the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, obtaining the Acquisition Financing (and any
Substitute Financing) and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

                  5.8 Solvency. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity,
after taking into account consummation of the Merger, the transactions
contemplated by the Commitments (and any Substitute Financing) and the way HTI
Acquisition intends that the businesses of the Company be operated after the
Effective Time (including any agreements or arrangements by and among HTI
Acquisition and the parties to the Commitments), (i) will be able to pay its
debts, including its stated and contingent liabilities as they mature, (ii) will
not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is and will be
engaged and (iii) will be solvent.

                  5.9 Delivery of New Employment Agreements. HTI Acquisition has
delivered to Alleghany true, correct and complete and signed counterparts of the
New Employment Agreements.

                  5.10 Brokers. Except for Craig R. Stapleton, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by HTI Acquisition, no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
HTI Acquisition.

      replacements);

                                      -26-

regarding the Company to any third party), directly or indirectly, any
inquiries, discussions or proposals for, continue or enter into negotiations
looking toward, or enter into or consummate any agreement or understanding in
connection with any proposal regarding any purchase or other acquisition of all
or any portion of the assets or membership interests (whether newly issued or

Alleghany agrees to use reasonable efforts, consistent with those employed by it
prior to the date of this Agreement, to preserve and maintain the proprietary
information and trade secrets used in the Business, and neither the Company nor
Alleghany shall disclose to any third Person (other than HTI Acquisition and its
Representatives) any proprietary information or trade secrets used in the

matter of public knowledge. The covenants on the part of Alleghany contained in

contained in this Section 6.9 shall terminate at the Closing.

                  6.9 The Company's Obligations. Alleghany agrees to cause the
Company to fully perform in all material respects each and every obligation of
the Company under this Agreement to be performed by the Company prior to the
Effective Time.

                  6.10 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and specifically subject to the limitations on the
obligations of the Company and Alleghany set forth in Section 6.4 hereof with

use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under all Applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 9.

            7. Covenants of HTI Acquisition.

                  7.1 Confidential Information. Prior to the Closing, HTI
Acquisition and its Representatives shall keep confidential all information and
documents provided to HTI Acquisition or its Representatives prior to the date
of this Agreement or pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof in accordance with the terms
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement by and between Alleghany and Capital
Partners dated as of August 27, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and HTI
Acquisition agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its Representatives, to be
bound by all of the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if it were a party
thereto. The covenants of HTI Acquisition contained in this Section 7.1 shall
terminate at the Closing.

                  7.2 Consents and Approvals. HTI Acquisition shall use its best
efforts to obtain prior to the Closing all consents, authorizations and
approvals under all Applicable Laws of any Governmental Authority or of any
other Person required to be obtained by HTI Acquisition in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that HTI
Acquisition shall not be required to pay any landlord or other Person any money
or other consideration in order to obtain any such consent; provided, further,
that HTI Acquisition shall not otherwise be required to incur any unreasonable
expenses in order to obtain any such consent, authorization or approval.

                  7.3 Financing Obligation. HTI Acquisition will use its best
efforts to do or cause to be done all things necessary to consummate the
Acquisition Financing. HTI Acquisition shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Equity Investors to comply with the terms of their respective
Equity Commitment Letters and to cause HTI Holding to


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

comply with the terms of the Commitment Letter. HTI Acquisition shall not, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Equity Investors not to,
amend or modify the terms of (i) the Commitment Letters (including all exhibits,
annexes, schedules, fee letters and other ancillary documents) in a manner that
would increase the conditionality of the Commitment Letters or in a manner that
would adversely affect the ability of HTI Acquisition to consummate the
transactions provided for herein or the likelihood of the Merger or (ii) the
Equity Commitment Letters, in each case without the prior written consent of
Alleghany. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letters, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable to HTI Acquisition on the terms and
conditions set forth therein, HTI Acquisition shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain substitute financing ("Substitute Financing"). Prior to the
Effective Time, HTI Acquisition will not amend or modify, or agree to amend or
modify, any agreement or other document or plan, which, pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letters, requires the lenders' prior consent to amend or is a
condition to the lenders' obligations thereunder, without the prior written
consent of the lenders party to the Commitment Letters and any other Person
whose consent is required pursuant to the Commitment Letters, which consent(s)
shall acknowledge that such amendment or modification does not relieve such
lender or other Person of its obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letters.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall obligate
any Equity Investor to provide any credit support, guarantee or other payment to
the lenders in addition to those currently contained in the Commitment Letters
(other than making their equity contributions pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letters) in connection with HTI Acquisition obtaining the Acquisition Financing
or any Substitute Financing.

                  7.4 Acquisition Financing. The indebtedness contemplated by
the Commitment Letters (or any Substitute Financing) shall be incurred by HTI
Acquisition at or prior to the Effective Time.

                  7.5 Annual Incentive Plan. HTI Acquisition shall continue the
existing annual incentive plans of the Company in accordance with their terms at
least through December 31, 2004, and the Surviving Entity shall make all
incentive payments in respect of calendar year 2004 provided for thereunder in
accordance with the terms of such plans.

                  7.6 Payment of Certain Debt. At the Closing, HTI Acquisition
will repay in full (i) the Alleghany Debt and (ii) the LaSalle Debt.

                  7.7 Certain Post-Closing Matters.

                  (A) On and after the Closing Date, HTI Acquisition (or any
successor company) shall have all liability and responsibility for meeting all
requirements under "COBRA," as hereinafter defined, with respect to each Person
who becomes an "M&A qualified beneficiary," within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, Q/A-4(b), because of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For these purposes, "COBRA" shall mean the
health care continuation coverage described in Section 4980B of the Code,
Section 601 through 608 of ERISA and any applicable state law which requires the
continuation of health care coverage to a terminated employee.

                  (B) For policy periods commencing on and after April 1, 1996,


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

Alleghany has mainted certain umbrella insurance policies for the benefit of
Alleghany and its subsidiaries on a group-wide basis (the "Alleghany Umbrella
Policies"). Coverage under some or all of such Alleghany Umbrella Policies may
be available to HTI Acquisition, as the Surviving Entity in the Merger, from and
after the Closing. HTI Acquisition agrees that, from and after the Closing, (i)
HTI Acquisition will assert any claim which it seeks to make under an Alleghany
Umbrella Policy only through Alleghany (and Alleghany agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assert any such claim on behalf of HTI
Acquisition), and (ii) HTI Acquisition will not seek to assert any claim which,
together with all other claims asserted by HTI Acquisition, would cause the
aggregate amount of claims asserted under an Alleghany Umbrella Policy to exceed
$5 million in any policy period. For the avoidance of doubt, Alleghany makes no
representation or warranty as to the availability of coverage under any
Alleghany Umbrella Policy to HTI Acquisition after the Effective Time.

                  (C) Following the Closing, HTI Acquisition shall allow
Alleghany, at Alleghany's expense and with counsel of its choice, to assume
complete control of the prosecution and collection of the Customs Refund. HTI
Acquisition shall fully cooperate with and assist Alleghany in the prosecution
and collection of the Customs Refund to the same extent as if it were an Income
Tax Claim described in Section 10.4, except that Alleghany shall have sole
control over the prosecution and collection of the Customs Refund and shall be
entitled to settle or dispose of the Customs Refund without HTI Acquisition's
consent. If, as, and to the extent any of the Customs Refund is received by HTI
Acquisition, HTI Acquisition shall promptly (and in any event within 5 business
days) pay the amount of the Customs Refund received by it to Alleghany. To the
extent that all or any part of the Customs Refund may be assigned or
transferred, upon the request of Alleghany, HTI Acquisition will assign or
transfer the Customs Refund in accordance with that request. HTI Acquisition's
sole obligation with respect to the Customs Refund shall be to cooperate with
Alleghany in the prosecution and collection of such Customs Refund and to
promptly pay over to Alleghany all or any part of the Customs Refund collected
(or to transfer and assign the Customs Refund as requested).

                  (D) Alleghany agrees to reimburse HTI Acquisition (or any
successor thereto) for the reasonable costs (including, without limitation,
administrative costs and any insurance premiums directly attributable to) of
providing retiree medical benefits to Leon Bookman and his spouse. HTI
Acquisition agrees that it will use a reasonable basis to determine such costs
and to submit to Alleghany not more frequently than each calendar quarter a
statement of such costs (in reasonable detail). Alleghany agrees to reimburse
such costs to HTI Acquisition promptly (and, in any event, within 30 days of
submission to Alleghany). HTI Acquisition agrees to continue to provide
post-retirement medical benefits to Lee Bookman and his spouse pursuant to the
Heads & Threads Health Care Benefits Plan, as the same may be amended or
modified from time to time by HTI Acquisition (but no such amendment and
modification shall discriminate as between the medical benefits provided to
Bookman and his spouse and the comparable medical benefits provided to other
senior executives of HTI Acquisition, if applicable) as long as Alleghany
reimburses HTI Acquisition for such costs; provided that nothing herein shall
limit HTI Acquisition's right or ability to terminate or modify retiree medical
coverage provided to any other employee or retiree of HTI Acquisition. Alleghany
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to establish or provide
comparable or equivalent replacement retiree medical benefits for Lee Bookman
and his spouse, which


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

Alleghany shall reasonably pursue, and when Alleghany has established or
provided comparable or equivalent replacement retiree medical benefits for Lee
Bookman and his spouse, the obligations of the parties under this Section 7.7(D)
(including, without limitation, the obligation of HTI Acquisition to provide
such post-retirement medical benefits) shall cease.

                  7.8 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and specifically subject to the limitations on the
obligations of HTI Acquisition set forth in Section 7.2 hereof with regard to
consents and approvals, HTI Acquisition agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under all Applicable
Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.

consented to in writing by the Company and Alleghany.

                  (B) HTI Acquisition shall have performed and complied in all

            10. Tax Matters.

                  10.1 Tax Returns.

                  (A) Alleghany shall, or shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of or including
the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries that are required to be filed (with
extensions) on or before the Closing Date and shall timely pay all Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns will be prepared and filed by
Alleghany, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with
the prior practice of Alleghany, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable. HTI Acquisition shall, or shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, prepare and file all Tax Returns of or including the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (other than any federal Income Tax Returns) that
are required to be filed (with extensions) following the Closing Date for all
taxable periods ending prior to, or that include, the Closing Date and (subject
to Section 10.1(C) in respect of Income Tax Returns) shall pay any Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns that are Income Tax Returns
will be prepared and filed by HTI Acquisition in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of Alleghany, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

                  (B) For each taxable year of Alleghany for which the Company
and any of the Company Subsidiaries are included for all or any part of such
taxable year on any Consolidated Income Tax Return of Alleghany that is due
(with extensions) to be filed after the Closing Date, HTI Acquisition shall
prepare, or shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to prepare, in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company, and deliver to Alleghany no
later than June 15th of the immediately following calendar year, all relevant
Tax schedules, forms and information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, complete in all material respects, to permit their inclusion in
the Consolidated Income Tax Returns of Alleghany for each such taxable year.

                  (C) In the case of any Income Tax Return of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries that is not a federal Income Tax Return and that is
required to be filed with respect to any taxable period that ends before or
includes the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Income Tax Return"), HTI
Acquisition shall provide Alleghany with a copy of such completed Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return, together with the related work papers and such other
documents as Alleghany shall reasonably request, no later than 30 days before
the due date for


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

the filing of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return. Alleghany and its authorized
representatives shall have the right to review the Pre-Closing Income Tax
Returns received from HTI Acquisition pursuant to this Section 10.1(C). If the
Pre-Closing Income Tax Return is not in a Straddle Period, HTI Acquisition shall
make such changes to any Pre-Closing Income Tax Return as requested by Alleghany
for which there is a reasonable basis in fact and law, and if the Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return is for a Straddle Period and Alleghany disputes the treatment
of any items on the Income Tax Returns prepared by HTI Acquisition, Alleghany
and HTI Acquisition agree to consult with each other and attempt to resolve in
good faith any such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute
with respect to a Pre-Closing Income Tax Return for a Straddle Period within 60
days after the receipt of any such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, the parties
shall submit such dispute to a mutually acceptable national accounting firm
(which shall not be the accountants who regularly audit the financial statements
of Alleghany or HTI Acquisition), whose decision shall be conclusive and binding
on the parties. Alleghany and HTI Acquisition shall each pay one-half of the
fees and expenses of such accounting firm. No fewer than 5 days before the due
date for the filing of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, Alleghany shall pay
to HTI Acquisition an amount equal to the Income Tax shown on such Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return, or if the Pre-Closing Income Tax Return is for a Straddle
Period, the amount of such Income Tax that is attributable to Alleghany pursuant
to Section 10.1(D). However, if any dispute relating to a Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return for a Straddle Period has not been resolved prior to the due date for the
filing of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, the Tax Return in question, to the
extent any issues thereon remain unresolved, shall be filed (and Alleghany shall
make payments pursuant to this Section 10.1(C)) in accordance with the positions
taken by HTI Acquisition; provided that the fact that such Tax Return will have
been filed in accordance with HTI Acquisition's position shall not be taken into
account for purposes of any dispute resolution under this Section 10.1(C). If a
determination is made through the dispute resolution process after a Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return is filed that HTI Acquisition's position was inappropriate,
HTI Acquisition shall promptly file an amended Income Tax Return in respect of
such taxable period (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) reflecting the
final decision of the accounting firm and an adjusting payment will be made by
Alleghany to HTI Acquisition or HTI Acquisition to Alleghany, as the case may
be, to reflect any difference between the Income Tax due with respect to the
amended Income Tax Return and the Income Tax due with respect to the Income Tax
Return as originally filed.

                  (D) Alleghany and HTI Acquisition agree that for all Income
Tax purposes, the taxable period of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
which began on January 1st of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
shall be terminated as of the close of business on the Closing Date and items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit shall be apportioned for all Income Tax
purposes on a basis consistent with, or the principles applicable in the
preparation of, the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Alleghany and HTI Acquisition
further agree to file all Income Tax Returns, handle the contest of any audit
and otherwise act for all Tax purposes consistent with the provisions of this
paragraph 10.1(D). If any taxable period for a non-federal Income Tax begins
before but ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), then the portion
of any Income Tax in such Straddle Period for which Alleghany shall be
responsible for all purposes of this Section 10 shall be calculated as if the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date was a separate taxable
period, except


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

that exemptions, allowances, deductions or credits that are calculated on an
annual basis (such as the deduction for depreciation or capital allowances)
shall be apportioned on a per diem basis.

                  10.2 Post-Closing Tax Matters.

                  (A) To the extent relevant for a taxable period for which the
requesting party is charged with payment responsibility for Taxes under this
Section 10, each of Alleghany and HTI Acquisition will provide the other (and
the other's attorneys, accountants and agents) with, and the Surviving Entity,
after the Closing Date, shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to provide, Alleghany (and Alleghany's attorneys, accountants and agents) with,
the right, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, to have access to,
and to copy and use, any records or information and personnel which may be
relevant for the preparation of any Tax Returns, the determination of amounts
due under Section 10.3, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority,
the filing of any claim for a refund of Tax or for the allowance of any Tax
credit, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for
Taxes. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other party
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. Any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 10.2(A) shall be held in strict
confidence and shall be used solely in connection with the reason for which it
was requested.

                  (B) Alleghany shall cause the Tax Sharing Agreement and/or any
similar arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date. To the extent
any such agreement or arrangement obligates the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to make any payments with respect to Taxes after the Closing Date,
none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Alleghany shall have any
obligation under any such agreement or arrangement for any past, present or
future period. Except as agreed to by HTI Acquisition, all powers of attorney
granted by the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes
shall be revoked as of the Closing Date.

                  (C) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any refund
of Income Taxes (other than any refund of Income Tax shown as an asset on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet) with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that is received with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the
portion of any Straddle Period for which Alleghany is responsible pursuant to
Section 10.1(D) shall be for the account of Alleghany, and to the extent that
HTI Acquisition or any of the Company Subsidiaries receives any such refund (or
such refund is applied against any Tax for which Alleghany is not responsible)
after the Closing Date, the amount of such refund and interest thereon or fairly
attributable thereto (net of any Taxes imposed with respect to the receipt or
accrual of such refund and interest and any reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining the refund) shall be promptly paid to Alleghany.


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

                  10.3 Alleghany Indemnity for Taxes. Alleghany shall pay and
shall indemnify and hold harmless HTI Acquisition, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and all Affiliates of HTI Acquisition against any and all Losses
resulting from or relating to:

                        (i) Income Taxes of the Company and the Company
      Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the portion of any
      Straddle Period for which Alleghany is responsible (including, for the
      avoidance of doubt, all Income Taxes resulting from the Merger);

                        (ii) the several liability of the Company and the
      Company Subsidiaries in respect of Income Taxes pursuant to Treasury
      Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law
      or regulation or by reason of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
      having been a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary group on or
      prior to the Closing Date; and

                        (iii) Income Taxes of any Person or entity other than
      the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement
      or contract, whether written or unwritten, entered into by the Company or
      any of the Company Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date, or as a
      transferor or successor, by contract or otherwise.

and any and all actions, suits, demands, assessments or judgments with respect
to any claim arising out of or relating to the subject matter of the
indemnification.

                  10.4 Matters Involving Income Tax Claims. If a claim is made
or threatened by any Taxing Authority that, if successful, may result in an
indemnity payment under Section 10.3 (an "Income Tax Claim"), HTI Acquisition
shall notify Alleghany stating the nature and basis of such claim, and the
amount thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice shall not
relieve Alleghany from any liability that it may have on account of this
indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that Alleghany is precluded
from, or materially prejudiced in, the defense of such claim thereby. Alleghany
will have the right, at its option, upon timely notice to HTI Acquisition, to
assume at its own expense control of any audit or other defense of any Income
Tax Claim with its own counsel. Alleghany's right to control an Income Tax Claim
will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts in dispute would be paid
by Alleghany or for which Alleghany would be liable pursuant to Section 10.3.
Costs of such Income Tax Claims are to be borne by Alleghany unless the Income
Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period, in which event such costs shall be
fairly apportioned. HTI Acquisition, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries at
their own expense shall cooperate with Alleghany in contesting any Income Tax
Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon Alleghany's
request, providing of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Income Tax Claim and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Alleghany shall not have the right
to solely control any Income Tax Claim unless it first acknowledges in writing
its obligation to fully indemnify HTI Acquisition for the Income Taxes at issue
in the proceeding, (ii) no settlement or disposition of any Income Tax Claim
shall be made without HTI Acquisition's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld,


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

conditioned or delayed) if the same could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect HTI Acquisition's, the Company's or any of the Company Subsidiary's
Income Tax Liability for Taxes in a taxable year or period beginning after the
Closing Date, and (iii) HTI Acquisition and Alleghany shall jointly control all
proceedings taken in connection with any claims for Income Taxes relating solely
to a Straddle Period of any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and each
party shall bear its own out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the contest and all
joint costs and expenses of the contest shall be borne in the same ratio as the
applicable proposed Income Tax would be allocated.

                  10.5 Transfer Taxes. Alleghany and HTI Acquisition shall each
pay one-half of all Transfer Taxes, if any, that result from the Merger.
Alleghany and HTI Acquisition shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of
all Tax Returns and other documentation relating to any such Transfer Taxes
including any that relate to any applicable exemption therefrom.

                  10.6 FIRPTA. On the Closing Date, Alleghany shall cause the
Company to provide HTI Acquisition with a certificate in the form required by
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder to the effect that the Company is not a "foreign person"
within the meaning of Section 1445(f) of the Code.

                  10.7 Survival. All rights and obligations under this Section
10 shall survive the Merger and continue indefinitely, except that the survival
of the representations and warranties in Section 4.11 shall be governed by
Section 12.1.

            11. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing by the mutual agreement in writing of HTI Acquisition and
Alleghany. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing as follows:

                  11.1 Termination by HTI Acquisition. HTI Acquisition may,
without liability to the Company or Alleghany, terminate this Agreement by
written notice to Alleghany if an event occurs that makes it impossible to
satisfy any condition to Closing set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.1 shall not be available to HTI Acquisition if any breach on the part of HTI
Acquisition of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, such impossibility.

                  11.2 Termination by Alleghany. Alleghany may, without
liability to HTI Acquisition, terminate this Agreement by written notice to HTI
Acquisition if an event occurs that makes it impossible to satisfy any condition
to Closing set forth in Section 8 of this Agreement; provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2 shall not be available to
Alleghany if any breach on the part of Alleghany or the Company of any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such impossibility.

                  11.3 Termination by Alleghany or by HTI Acquisition. Either
Alleghany, on the one hand, or HTI Acquisition, on the other hand, may terminate
this Agreement upon written notice to the other if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

February 28, 2005 (the "Termination Date"); notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall not be
available to HTI Acquisition (x) if any breach on the part of HTI Acquisition of
any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date, or (y) if HTI
Acquisition has failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations
set forth in Section 7.3 and Section 7.8 of this Agreement; and (ii) the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall not be available
to Alleghany (x) if any breach on the part of Alleghany or the Company of any
provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date, or (y) if either
Alleghany or the Company has failed to comply in all material respects with its
obligations set forth in Section 6.12 of this Agreement.

                  11.4 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated,
this Agreement shall no longer be of any force or effect and there shall be no
liability on the part of any party or its respective directors, officers or
shareholders other than for damages to the extent arising from a prior breach of
this Agreement which is a willful and material breach; provided, however, that
the Confidentiality Agreement, including the obligations of HTI Acquisition and
its Representatives thereunder as set forth in this Agreement, shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

            12. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification.

                  12.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation heretofore made or hereafter made by any of the parties hereto,
for a period of 18 months; provided, however, (i) all representations and
warranties made pursuant to Sections 4.11 (Taxes) and Section 5.8 (Solvency)
shall survive the Closing for a period continuing until 60 days from and after
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including extensions)
and (ii) all representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections 4.2
(Membership Interests Ownership), Section 4.4 (Authority) and Section 5.2
(Authority) shall survive indefinitely.

                  12.2 Alleghany's Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Section 12, and other than in respect of matters
with respect to which Alleghany is obligated to provide indemnification pursuant
to Section 10.3, which are governed solely by Section 10 hereof, Alleghany
agrees to indemnify and hold HTI Acquisition harmless against any and all
Losses, except as expressly limited by the terms of Section 12.3, resulting from
or relating to:

                  (A) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company or Alleghany contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
by the Company or Alleghany at the Closing; provided that any claim for
indemnification made by HTI Acquisition for indemnification from Alleghany under
this paragraph (A) may be made no later than a date 18 months from and after the
Closing Date, excepting only that (i) any claim for breach of any representation
or warranty under Section 4.11 (Taxes) may be made no later than a date 60 days
from and after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation
(including extensions) and (ii)


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

any claim for breach of any representation or warranty under Section 4.2
(Membership Interests Ownership), or Section 4.4 (Authority) may be made at any
time;

                  (B) any breach of any covenant of the Company or Alleghany
contained in this Agreement; provided that any claim made by HTI Acquisition for
indemnification from Alleghany under this paragraph (B) for the breach of any
covenant of the Company or Alleghany contained in this Agreement may be made no
later than a date one year from and after the last day of the period during
which such covenant was to be performed; and

                  (C) for any obligation, liability (including any liability
under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA), lien, fine, penalty or Tax with
respect to, or by reason of, any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA) of any entity (other than the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries) which has ever been considered a single employer with
Alleghany under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code prior to the Closing Date.

                  For purposes of the indemnification provided in Section
12.2(A), in determining whether the representations and warranties of the
Company or Alleghany have been breached, no effect will be given to any
materiality qualifier set forth in such representations and warranties or
related definitions.

                  For purposes of determining the extent to which Alleghany has
breached any representation contained in Section 4.11 of this Agreement, in the
case of any Straddle Period, (i) in the case of any Non-Income Tax of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that is based on specific receipts,
transactions, events or occurrences, the portion of such Non-Income Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined by reference to the date of the receipt, transaction, event
or occurrence giving rise to the liability for such Non-Income Tax, and (ii) in
the case of any Non-Income Taxes of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that are imposed on a periodic, annual or other basis not related
to specific receipts, transactions, events or occurrences, the portion of such
Non-Income Taxes of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries attributable
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall equal the
total amount of such Non-Income Taxes for the period in question, multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such period in the
Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such period with respect to which such
Non-Income Tax accrues or is imposed in the Straddle Period.

                  12.3 Limitation on Alleghany's Indemnification Obligations.
Except as hereinafter provided in this Section 12.3, Alleghany shall have no
obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(A) except to the
extent that the aggregate amount of indemnification to which HTI Acquisition,
but for this Section 12.3, otherwise shall have become entitled hereunder would
exceed $375,000 ("Alleghany's Basket"), in which event Alleghany shall be
obligated, subject to the next succeeding sentence, to provide indemnification
with respect to all amounts in excess of Alleghany's Basket. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Alleghany have any


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(A) in an aggregate amount
in excess of $10,000,000 ("Alleghany's Cap").

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Alleghany shall be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section
12.2(A) for any and all amounts owing by Alleghany to HTI Acquisition pursuant
to Section 12.2(A) as a result of any fraud involving a Knowing breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company or Alleghany made in this Agreement,
and Alleghany's Basket and Alleghany's Cap referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be calculated without taking into account any such
amounts.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Alleghany shall be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2
(B) and Section 12.2(C) without limitation and without regard to Alleghany's
Basket or Alleghany's Cap referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.

                  12.4 HTI Acquisition's Indemnification Obligations. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Section 12, and other than in respect of Income
Taxes, which are governed solely by Section 10 hereof, HTI Acquisition agrees to
indemnify and hold Alleghany harmless against any and all Losses, except as
expressly limited by the terms of Section 12.5, resulting from or relating to:

                  (A) any breach of any representation or warranty of HTI
Acquisition contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by HTI
Acquisition to the Company or Alleghany at the Closing; provided that any claim
made by Alleghany for indemnification from HTI Acquisition under this paragraph
(A) may be made no later than a date 18 months from and after the Closing Date,
excepting only that (i) any claim for breach of any representation or warranty
under Section 5.8 (Solvency) may be made no later than a date 60 days from and
after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (including
extensions) and (ii) any claim for breach of any representation or warranty
under Section 5.2 (Authority) may be made at any time; and

                  (B) any breach of any covenant of HTI Acquisition contained in
this Agreement; provided that any claim made by Alleghany for indemnification
from HTI Acquisition under this paragraph (B) for the breach of any covenant of
HTI Acquisition contained in this Agreement may be made no later than a date one
year from and after the last day of the period during which such covenant was to
be performed.

                  For purposes of the indemnification provided in Section
12.4(A), in determining whether the representations and warranties of HTI
Acquisition have been breached, no effect will be given to any materiality
qualifier set forth in such representations and warranties or related
definitions.

                  12.5 Limitation on HTI Acquisition's Indemnification
Obligations. Except as hereinafter provided in this Section 12.5, HTI
Acquisition shall have no obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to
Section 12.4(A) except to the extent that the aggregate amount of
indemnification to which Alleghany, but for this Section 12.5, otherwise shall
have become entitled hereunder would exceed $375,000 ("HTI Acquisition's
Basket"), in which


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

event HTI Acquisition shall be obligated, subject to the next succeeding
sentence, to provide indemnification with respect to all amounts in excess of
HTI Acquisition's Basket. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall HTI Acquisition have any liability for
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.4(A) in an aggregate amount in excess of
$1,000,000 ("HTI Acquisition's Cap"); provided, however, that HIT Acquisition's
Cap shall not apply, and no other limitation shall apply, to the indemnification
obligation of HTI Acquisition in respect of the breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 5.8 (Solvency).

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
HTI Acquisition shall be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to
Section 12.4(A) for any and all amounts owing by HTI Acquisition to Alleghany
pursuant to this Section 12.4(A) as a result of any fraud involving a Knowing
breach of a representation or warranty of HTI Acquisition made in this
Agreement, and HTI Acquisition's Basket and HTI Acquisition's Cap referred to in
the immediately preceding paragraph shall be calculated without taking into
account any such amounts.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
HTI Acquisition shall be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to
Section 12.4(B) without limitation and without regard to HTI Acquisition's
Basket or HTI Acquisition's Cap referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph.

                  12.6 Other Limitations on Indemnification.

                  (A) The amount of any Losses sustained by an indemnified party
shall be reduced (i) by any amount received by such indemnified party with
respect thereto under any insurance coverage relating thereto (other than
insurance coverage provided by an Affiliate of such indemnified party) or from
any third party (not a party to this Agreement) alleged to be responsible
therefor, and (ii) by the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized with
respect to the Loss. Each of Alleghany and HTI Acquisition agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such
insurance coverage and from any such third party alleged to have responsibility
and to realize any Tax benefit with respect to the Loss. If an indemnified party
realizes a Tax benefit or receives an amount under insurance coverage or from
any such third party with respect to Losses sustained at any time subsequent to
any indemnification provided pursuant to this Section 12, then such indemnified
party shall promptly reimburse the indemnifying party for any payment made by
such indemnifying party in connection with providing such indemnification up to
such amount realized or received by such indemnified party. Nothing in this
Section 12.6(A) shall limit in any way the ability of Alleghany or HTI
Acquisition to (i) take (or refrain from taking, as the case may be) any
reasonable position for Tax purposes that it determines to take (or refrain from
taking) in its sole discretion, or (ii) refrain from pursuing any third party
insurance recovery that Alleghany or HTI Acquisition, as the case may be,
determines would be commercially inadvisable to pursue.

                  (B) Each indemnified party shall be obligated to use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate to the fullest extent practicable the amount
of any Loss for which its it entitled to seek indemnification hereunder, and the
indemnifying party shall not be required to make any


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

payment to an indemnified party in respect of such Loss to the extent such
indemnified party has failed to comply with the foregoing obligation.

                  (C) Upon making any indemnification payment, the indemnifying
party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
indemnified party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the
payment relates; provided, however, that until the indemnified party recovers
full payment of its Loss, any and all claims of the indemnifying party against
any such third party on account of said payment are hereby made expressly
subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the indemnified party's rights
against such third party. Without limiting the generality of any other provision
hereof, each such indemnified party and indemnifying party will duly execute
upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
above described subrogation and subordination rights.

                  (D) Neither Alleghany nor HTI Acquisition shall have any right
to set off any Losses against any payments to be made by such party pursuant to
this Agreement.

                  12.7 Notice. In the event that either Alleghany or HTI
Acquisition wishes to assert a claim for indemnification under this Section 12,
the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall deliver
written notice (a "Claims Notice") to the other party (the "Indemnifying Party")
no later than twenty (20) Business Days after such claim becomes known to the
Indemnified Party, specifying the facts constituting the basis for, and the
amount (if known) of the claim asserted. Failure to deliver a Claims Notice with
respect to a claim in a timely manner as specified in the preceding sentence
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Section 12, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
by such failure.

                  12.8 Right to Contest Claims of Third Parties.

                  (A) If an Indemnified Party asserts, or may in the future seek
to assert, a claim for indemnification hereunder because of an Action instituted
by any Person not a party to this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claimant") that may
result in a Loss with respect to which the Indemnified Party would be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Section 12 (an "Asserted Liability"), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a Claims Notice with
respect thereto, which Claims Notice shall, in accordance with the provisions of
Section 12.7 hereof, be delivered as promptly as practicable and in any event no
later than twenty (20) Business Days after such Asserted Liability is actually
known to the Indemnified Party. The failure to deliver a Claims Notice with
respect to an Asserted Liability within twenty (20) Business Days of the
Indemnified Party's receipt of written notice of such Asserted Liability shall
not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Section 12, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
by such failure.

                  (B) (i) The Indemnifying Party shall, upon receipt of such
notice and upon its notifying the Indemnified Party in writing that it shall,
either unconditionally or subject to a reservation of rights, indemnify the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter, be entitled to participate in or,
at the Indemnifying Party's option, assume at its own expense the defense,
appeal or settlement of such Asserted Liability with respect to which such
indemnity


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

has been invoked with counsel of its own choosing (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), and the Indemnified Party shall fully
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith including
contesting such Asserted Liability or making any counterclaim against the Third
Party Claimant; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense, appeal or settlement of such Asserted Liability, (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for out of pocket expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party (such as travel costs, but not internal time charges)
and (ii) if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, an
actual conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to employ one counsel to represent itself, and in that event
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. An Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to the date
on which its receives written notice from the Indemnifying Party that it intends
to assume the defense, appeal or settlement of such Asserted Liability, to file
any motion, answer or other pleading and take such other action which it shall
reasonably deem necessary to protect its interest or that of the Indemnifying
Party until the date on which the Indemnified Party receives such notice from
the Indemnifying Party; provided that, prior to filing such motion, answer or
other pleading or taking such other action, the Indemnified Party shall have
made reasonable efforts to consult with the Indemnifying Party. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense, appeal or settlement of
such Asserted Liability within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice thereof
from the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to
undertake the defense or appeal of or settle or compromise such Asserted
Liability on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party,
unless and until the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it
has elected to assume such defense, appeal or settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume the defense, appeal or settlement of such Asserted
Liability and the Indemnified Party undertakes such defense, appeal or
settlement, the Indemnified Party shall, upon the request of the Indemnifying
Party, keep the Indemnifying Party advised of relevant developments on a timely
basis.

                  (ii) Except as set forth in Section 12.8(B)(i), no claim or
demand may be settled by the Indemnified Party without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
Unless the claim or demand seeks only dollar damages (all of which are to be
paid by the Indemnifying Party), no such claim or demand may be settled by the
Indemnifying Party without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

                  (iii) Alleghany and HTI Acquisition shall make mutually
available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to
any Asserted Liability and shall cooperate with each other in the defense
thereof.

                  12.9 Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payment
hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as the Indemnified Party shall designate to the Indemnifying
Party in writing.

                  12.10 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Alleghany and HTI
Acquisition agree to treat, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law,
any payments


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

under this Section 12 or under Section 10 hereof as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes.

                  12.11 Exclusive Remedy. If the Closing occurs, absent any
fraud, the indemnification provided for in this Section 12 and in Section 10
hereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in any action seeking money
damages or any other form of monetary relief brought by any party to this
Agreement. The terms of this Section 12.11 shall not be construed as limiting in
any way whatsoever any remedy (i) in the event of any fraud or (ii) other than
for the recovery of money damages or another form of monetary relief.

            13. Non-Competition. For a period of three years commencing on the
Closing Date (the "Non-Compete Period"), Alleghany will not, and Alleghany will
not permit any Company Subsidiary of Alleghany to, directly or indirectly,
market, sell or distribute, anywhere in the world (within or without North
America), any product which, at the time of Closing, is marketed, sold or
distributed, or which, to the Knowledge of Alleghany at the time of Closing, is
proposed to be marketed, sold or distributed, by the Company (any such
marketing, sale or distribution, a "Competing Activity"); provided, however,
that the foregoing restrictions shall not prevent Alleghany or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, during the Non-Compete Period, from (i) holding or
acquiring for investment purposes only any interest in securities of a Person
which are listed or quoted or traded on any generally recognized market;
provided that such securities amount to less than ten percent (10%) of the
outstanding securities of such Person and carry less than ten percent (10%) of
the voting rights attaching to the outstanding securities of that Person, or
(ii) purchasing an entity or group of entities (an "Acquired Entity") that
engages in a Competing Activity, so long as the gross revenues of the Competing
Activity do not exceed 15% of the gross revenues of the Acquired Entity during
the most recent fiscal year of the Acquired Entity ended before the date of
acquisition of the Acquired Entity. If, at the time of enforcement of this
Section 13, a court shall hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions
stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties
agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such
circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and
that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to
cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.

            14. Miscellaneous.

                  14.1 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, each of the parties will pay all of its own fees and expenses
(including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants,
investment bankers and other representatives and agents) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting
the foregoing, all such fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the
Merger in connection with the performance of the obligations of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the Company and, except as specifically provided otherwise in Section
3.2 hereof, shall be fully accrued on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The fees
and expenses of Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin shall be shared equally by
Alleghany and HTI Acquisition. For the avoidance of doubt, no fees and expenses
described in this Agreement as payable by HTI Acquisition (including without
limitation fees and expenses of the Designated Accountants payable by HTI
Acquisition pursuant to Section 3.2(C), fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants payable by HTI

Acquisition pursuant to Section 3.2(H), fees and expenses of Craig Stapleton
payable by HTI Acquisition pursuant to Section 5.10, and fees and expenses of

                  14.2 Waiver. The parties hereto may by written agreement (i)
extend the time for or waive or modify the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the parties hereto or (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

enforced in or by such courts, and the parties irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action shall be heard and determined in such a New York
State or federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
