therefore, expires on <U><B>Expiration Date</B></U>. If your employment should cease prior to the date
on which your grant expires, your right to vest and exercise under the Option will be subject to
early termination as provided in Section&nbsp;4 of the Rules relating to Stock Options under the Plan.
Except under certain circumstances specified in Section&nbsp;4, you will generally have the right of
continued vesting for three months following the date of termination of your employment, and during
that three-month period you will have the right to exercise the shares covered by the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Option that
were vested on the date of termination, and any shares that vest during the three-month period will
then be exercisable for the remainder of that period. If you are employed pursuant to an
employment agreement with Disney, any provisions thereof relating to the effect of a termination of
your employment upon your rights under this Option shall supercede the provisions hereof relating
to the same subject matter, but in no event shall the restriction on sale of shares acquired upon
the exercise of the Option referred to below apply after any termination of your employment with
Disney.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">You may exercise this Option as to all or part of the number of shares covered by the Option which
are then vested by paying the aggregate exercise price and applicable withholding taxes on the
gross gain. You will be provided with additional information at the time of exercise about the
methods available for exercising your Option and paying your withholding taxes, in accordance with
the methods of exercising options permitted under Section&nbsp;2 and Section&nbsp;5 of the Rules relating to
Stock Options under the Plan. You are urged to seek advice from your tax accountant or attorney
when making decisions regarding the exercise of this Option. This Option may not be transferred or
assigned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof, you agree by acceptance of this Option that,
except for certain shares (the &#147;Tax-Available Shares&#148;) that may be sold to pay taxes up to the
Maximum Tax Liability (as defined below) upon an exercise of a portion of, or all of, this Option,
you will hold, for not less than twelve months from the date of exercise of this Option, shares
representing no less than &#091;seventy-five percent (75%)&#093; &#091;one hundred percent (100%)&#093; of the shares
acquired by you (other than Tax-Available Shares) upon such exercise. For purposes hereof the term
&#147;Maximum Tax Liability&#148; shall mean the amount calculated by multiplying total income recognized, as
reported by Disney for Federal income tax purposes, upon an exercise of this Option, by a
percentage determined as follows:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FR &#043; SR (100-FR) &#043; MR


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">where:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FR = the highest Federal income tax rate in effect at time of exercise of the Option;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR = the highest state income tax rate, if any, in effect at the time of exercise of the Option in
the state where your principle Disney office is located; and

<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MR = the Medicare tax rate in effect at time of exercise of the Option.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The number of whole shares acquired upon any exercise of the Options that may be sold to discharge
the Maximum Tax Liability shall be determined by dividing the Maximum Tax Liability by the fair
market value (as defined in Section&nbsp;2 of the Rules relating to the Plan) of one share of Disney
common stock on the date of exercise of the Option and disregarding any fractional amount resulting
from such calculation. For the purposes hereof, your commitment to hold the percentage of shares
referred to above for not less than twelve months shall constitute and undertaking by you not to
sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, except for certain transfers to
&#147;family members&#148; and certain others permitted with the prior approval of the Committee pursuant to
Section 9(b) of the Plan, any of such shares during such period.
