&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beginning with the Company&#146;s Fiscal Year 2005, the Executive shall be           eligible to
receive an annual incentive bonus pursuant to the Company&#146;s           Management
Incentive Program, as same may be amended or superseded from time to           time (the
Management Incentive Program, as same may be amended or superseded           from time to
time, is hereinafter referred to as the &#147;MIP&#148;). The           Company
represents that the formula the Company currently uses to calculate           annual
bonus awards under the MIP for its MIP eligible Executive Vice Presidents           is:
(A)&nbsp;to multiply the executive&#146;s annual base salary for the           relevant
fiscal year by the executive&#146;s target incentive rate; (B) then,           multiply
the resulting product by the executive&#146;s individual rating (as           determined
by the Company in its sole discretion and as approved by the Board or           a duly
appointed committee thereof in its sole discretion); and (C) then,           multiply the
resulting product by the Company&#146;s rating (as determined by           the Board or a
duly appointed committee thereof in its sole discretion). For           purposes of
illustration: assuming an executive has: (x) a $500,000 annual base           salary; (y)
a target incentive rate of forty (40%) percent; and (z) an           individual
performance rating of 1.1; and the Company&#146;s rating is 1.1, the           executive
would receive an MIP award of $242,000. The Company also represents           that the
Executive&#146;s initial target incentive rate under the MIP will be           forty
(40%) percent. &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the Company&#146;s Fiscal Year 2004, the Company shall pay the Executive a
          bonus of $350,000 (the &#147;2004&#148; Bonus), $175,000 of which shall be
          payable within twenty (20) days of the Executive&#146;s commencement of
          employment hereunder and $175,000 of which shall be payable on or before April
          30, 2005. The Executive agrees that the Executive&#146;s right to receive the
          2004 Bonus shall be contingent upon the Executive&#146;s employment not having
          been terminated prior to the closing date of the Company&#146;s Fiscal Year
          2004: (1) because of his resignation (unless such resignation is with Good
          Reason as that term is defined in paragraph 6(E) below); or (2) pursuant to
          paragraph 6(D) below. The Executive further agrees that if after receipt of any
          portion of the 2004 Bonus referred to above and before November 3, 2005, he
          resigns his employment (unless such resignation is with Good Reason as that
term           is defined in paragraph 6(E) below), or if the Company terminates
          Executive&#146;s employment pursuant to paragraph&nbsp; 6(D) below, the
          Executive, shall, within thirty (30) days of such resignation or termination,
          repay the Company an amount which shall be determined by multiplying the amount
          of the 2004 Bonus that Executive has received as of the date of such
resignation           or termination by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be 365
less the           number of days between November 3, 2004 and the date his employment
shall           terminate, and the denominator of which shall be 365. &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

Any dispute, controversy or claim           between the parties hereto arising out of or
relating to this Agreement either           during or after the term thereof, shall be
settled by arbitration conducted in           the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in
accordance with the Commercial Rules of           the American Arbitration Association
then in force, provided, however, the           Executive acknowledges that in the event
of a violation of paragraphs 11 and 12           of this Agreement, the Company shall be
entitled to obtain from a court in the           Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive           relief as well as damages, which
rights shall be in addition to any other rights           or remedies to which it may be
entitled. The decision of the arbitrator or           arbitrators conducting any such
arbitration proceedings shall be in writing,           shall set forth the basis
therefore and such arbitrator&#146;s or           arbitrators&#146; decision or award
shall be final and binding upon the parties           hereto. The parties hereto shall
abide by all awards rendered in such           arbitration proceedings, and all such
awards may be enforced and executed upon           in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against whom or which           enforcement of such award is sought. &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

It is the intention of the parties           that the provisions of this Agreement shall
be enforced to the fullest extent           permissible under the laws and public
policies of each state and jurisdiction in           which such enforcement is sought,
but that the unenforceability (or the           modification to conform with such laws or
public policies) of any provisions           hereof, shall not render unenforceable or
impair the remainder of this           Agreement. Accordingly, if any provision of this
Agreement shall be determined           to be invalid or unenforceable, either in whole
or in part, this Agreement shall           be deemed amended to delete or modify, as
necessary, the offending provisions           and to alter the balance of this Agreement
in order to render the same valid and           enforceable to the fullest extent
permissible. &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<B><U>Non-Disclosure</U></B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Executive shall not, at any           time during or following the period of
employment, disclose, use, transfer or           sell, except in the course of such
employment, any confidential information or           proprietary data of the Company and
its subsidiaries so long as such information           or data remains confidential and
has not been disclosed or is not otherwise in           the public domain, except as
required by law or pursuant to legal process or in           connection with an
administrative proceeding before a governmental agency. The           Company and the
Executive agree that the Executive&#146;s obligations under this           paragraph
shall not apply if (1) any disclosure by the Executive is made with           the express
written permission of the Company; and/or (2) if the Executive can           show by
documentary evidence that he had knowledge of the confidential           information, or
it was in his possession, prior to disclosure by the Company, or           that it was
lawfully received by the Executive from a third party who is not or           was not
bound, at the time the information was conveyed, by any confidential
          relationship or obligation to the Company. &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

6(E) hereof, or the Company terminates the           Executive&#146;s employment pursuant
to an event or condition described in           paragraph 6(B) or 6(D) hereof, except as
provided below, the Executive will not           for a period of eighteen (18) months
thereafter engage in or carry on, directly           or indirectly, either for himself or
as a member of a partnership, or as a           stockholder, investor (except that
ownership of 5% or less of any class of debt           or equity securities which are
publicly traded shall not be a violation of this           paragraph 12), officer or
director of a corporation or as an employee, agent,           associate or consultant of
any person, partnership, or corporation in any           business in competition with the
principal businesses carried on by the Company           and its subsidiaries and
affiliates (as that term is described below) in any           jurisdiction in which the
Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates actively           conduct business; provided,
however, that if, during the eighteen (18) month           period, the Company elects to
enforce the provisions of this paragraph and the           Executive&#146;s employment
shall have been terminated either by the Executive           without &#147;Good Reason&#148; or
by the Company pursuant to paragraph 6(D)           hereof, the Company shall pay to the
Executive (in accordance with its then           current payroll practices) at the rate
of his base salary as of the date of his           termination. If the Company, at its
sole option, decides not to continue the           Executive&#146;s base salary at any
time during the eighteen (18) month period,           this non-competition provision
shall not thereafter be enforceable. Nothing in           this paragraph 12 or in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require the Company to           continue to pay the
Executive any portion of his base salary in the event the           Executive terminates
his employment without Good Reason or the Company           terminates the Executive&#146;s
employment pursuant to an event or condition           described in paragraph 6(D)
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) for           purposes of this Agreement, the
term &#147;principal business carried on by the           Company and its subsidiaries
and affiliates&#148; shall be limited to           &#147;upper moderate&#148; and &#147;better&#148; &#147;Missy&#148; apparel
          specialty stores, including, for purposes of illustration, but not limited to,
          Ann Taylor, Coldwater Creek, J. Jill and Chicos; and (B) nothing in this
          paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Executive from engaging in
          consulting to any aspect of the apparel industry after such termination. &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
