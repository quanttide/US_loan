</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>RICHMOND, Va. -  Chesapeake Corporation (NYSE: CSK) today announced the expiration of its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding $85.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.20% Debentures due March 15, 2005 (CUSIP #165159AF1) and solicitation of consents to proposed amendments to the indenture governing the debentures.  </P>

<P>In conjunction with the cash tender offer, Chesapeake accepted for payment a total of approximately $66.8 million principal amount of the debentures, or 78.5% of the debentures outstanding, that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 20, 2004.  </P>

<P>The percentage of consents received during the offer exceeded the requisite consents needed to amend the indenture governing the debentures. Chesapeake and The Bank of New York, the trustee under the indenture, have executed a supplemental indenture to effect the proposed amendments. The amendments eliminate the principal restrictive covenants in the indenture and permit satisfaction and discharge of any debentures not tendered in the offer.</P>

<P>Chesapeake engaged Banc of America Securities LLC to act as the exclusive dealer manager and solicitation agent in connection with the offer.  </P>
