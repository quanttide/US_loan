STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Irvine, California &#150; December 30, 2004 &#150; Newport Corporation (NASDAQ: NEWP) today updated its financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2004. The company
confirmed that it expects its sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 to be within the range announced in October 2004 of $100 million to $103 million. In addition, the company expects its fourth quarter 2004 orders to exceed sales, resulting in a
book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.0. The company anticipates pro forma earnings per share (excluding acquisition, integration, restructuring and asset impairment charges) to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.10 per share, consistent with the range
announced in October 2004. The company also announced that due to current actions planned and as a result of its annual goodwill impairment assessment, it expects to record non-cash charges of approximately $65.5 million related to the impairment of
goodwill and other assets related to its Advanced Packaging and Automation Systems (APAS) Division. As a result of these charges, together with the acquisition, integration and other charges included in the company&#146;s original fourth quarter
guidance, the company now anticipates recording a loss for the fourth quarter in the range of $1.54 to $1.60 per share. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Our order intake and sales levels for the fourth quarter are meeting our expectations. The important photonics applications we now serve in a number
of end markets have clearly added balance to our revenue mix, making our performance and growth prospects less dependent on the cyclical semiconductor segment. The momentum we are generating today is clearly the result of a very positive reaction
from our customers and the integrated product solutions we now offer,&#148; said Robert G. Deuster, chairman and chief executive officer. </FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Deuster continued, &#147;The integration of Spectra-Physics has led us to undertake a strategic review of
all of our businesses. Our Lasers Division and our Photonics and Precision Technologies (PPT) Division are proving to be very compatible and are delivering strong financial results. We expect these divisions to be even more profitable in 2005 once
we have concluded our integration program. Our APAS Division, which primarily serves the front- and back-end semiconductor industries, is the only part of our company that will be unprofitable, on a pro forma basis, in the fourth quarter. This
division was also unprofitable during the upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market in late 2003 and early 2004. This division experienced a slowdown in sales and orders during the third quarter of this year and, because of currently
reduced market demand for capital equipment, slow order intake levels continued into the fourth quarter.&#148; Deuster noted that, while APAS accounted for only approximately 5% ($5.5 million) of Newport&#146;s total company third quarter sales, it
produced an operating loss of $3.5 million, reducing Newport&#146;s third quarter pro forma net income to $2.9 million. Deuster concluded, &#147;We are taking aggressive actions to reduce this division&#146;s operating losses, in order to minimize
its negative impact on the company&#146;s future financial results. The robots, load ports, equipment front end modules, turnkey automated assembly systems sold by the APAS Division accounted for less than 15% of Newport&#146;s semiconductor capital
equipment sales in the third quarter of 2004, while the other 85% of sales to customers in these markets is derived from our Lasers and PPT Divisions&#146; products.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Deuster said that the company is undertaking a number of cost reduction and restructuring actions designed to reduce the
APAS Division&#146;s losses, including changes to the organizational structure of the division and cancellation of several product development programs to more selectively serve the semiconductor automation segment more profitably. The company
expects these actions to significantly increase the profitability of its overall sales to the semiconductor market in 2005. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The company also completed its annual impairment test of the goodwill recorded on its balance sheet in the fourth quarter. As a result, the company has
determined that the goodwill associated with this reporting unit has become impaired. Accordingly, the company will write off approximately $60 million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter. The </FONT>

2001 and Micro Robotics Systems, Inc. in 2002, both of which are now part of the APAS Division. In addition to the impairment of goodwill, the company expects to write off approximately $4.5 million in inventory associated primarily with certain
discontinued product lines and approximately $1.0 million in fixed assets that will no longer be utilized by this division. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Separately, Deuster noted that net income for the fourth quarter will be positively impacted by the reversal of a $2.5 million reserve that had been set
aside pending an Internal Revenue Service review of a tax refund received in September 2003. The IRS recently ruled in favor of the company, allowing the reversal of this reserve. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are
forward-looking statements. As discussed in Newport&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 2, 2004, assumptions relating to the foregoing involve
judgments and risks with respect to, among other things, the ability of Newport to successfully integrate Spectra-Physics with Newport and the contributions of Spectra-Physics to Newport&#146;s operating results; the ability of Newport&#146;s
management team to manage the combined operations of Newport and Spectra-Physics; the strength of business conditions in the semiconductor industry; Newport&#146;s ability to successfully penetrate and increase sales to the semiconductor packaging
and life and health sciences markets; the levels of private and governmental research funding worldwide; potential order cancellations and push-outs; potential product returns; future economic, competitive and market conditions, including those in
Europe and Asia and those related to its strategic markets; whether its products, particularly those targeting the company&#146;s strategic markets, will continue to achieve customer acceptance; risks associated with terrorist activity and resulting
economic uncertainty; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of Newport. Although Newport believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward-looking statements will be realized. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in
the forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Newport or any other person that Newport&#146;s objectives or plans will be achieved. Newport undertakes no obligation
to revise the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. </I></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
