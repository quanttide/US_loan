Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

On December 23, 2004, Advantage Bank (the "Bank"), the wholly-owned subsidiary
of Camco Financial Corporation (the "Corporation"), refinanced $144.1 million in
convertible fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati
(the "FHLB") with advances ranging up to 5 years. In connection with this
transaction, the Bank paid early payment fees totaling $18.88 million before tax
or $12.46 million after tax, which fees were included in the new advance.

The refinanced FHLB advances had a weighted average interest rate of 6.25% and
an average term of maturity of approximately 5.61 years. The new advances have a
weighted average interest rate of 3.59%. The Bank is obligated to make monthly
interest payments and to repay the full principal amount at maturity. As with
the refinanced advances, the new advance is secured by a blanket lien on 100% of
the Bank's one to four family mortgage portfolio and multi-family mortgage
portfolio.

The new advances were otherwise made on terms generally available to other FHLB
member institutions and were not accompanied by covenants or other restrictions
that the Corporation believes materially affect its business or operations, or
the rights of its shareholders.

On December 23, 2004, Camco Financial Corporation issued a news release
announcing this restructuring. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit
99.
