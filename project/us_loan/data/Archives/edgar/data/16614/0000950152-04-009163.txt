Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

On December 23, 2004, Advantage Bank (the "Bank"), the wholly-owned subsidiary
of Camco Financial Corporation (the "Corporation"), refinanced $144.1 million in
convertible fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati
(the "FHLB") with advances ranging up to 5 years. In connection with this
transaction, the Bank paid early payment fees totaling $18.88 million before tax
or $12.46 million after tax, which fees were included in the new advance.

The refinanced FHLB advances had a weighted average interest rate of 6.25% and
an average term of maturity of approximately 5.61 years. The new advances have a
weighted average interest rate of 3.59%. The Bank is obligated to make monthly
interest payments and to repay the full principal amount at maturity. As with
the refinanced advances, the new advance is secured by a blanket lien on 100% of
the Bank's one to four family mortgage portfolio and multi-family mortgage
portfolio.

The new advances were otherwise made on terms generally available to other FHLB
member institutions and were not accompanied by covenants or other restrictions
that the Corporation believes materially affect its business or operations, or
the rights of its shareholders.

On December 23, 2004, Camco Financial Corporation issued a news release
announcing this restructuring. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit
99.

                                  NEWS RELEASE

RELEASE DATE:      DECEMBER 23, 2004

RELEASE TIME:      4:30 P.M.


                   CAMCO FINANCIAL ANNOUNCES THE RESTRUCTURING
                                OF FHLB ADVANCES

CAMBRIDGE, OHIO (NASDAQ: CAFI) - Camco Financial Corporation (Corporation) today
announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Advantage Bank (Bank), prepaid and
restructured $144.1 million in convertible fixed rate borrowings from the
Federal Home Loan Bank. The early repayment of the debt will result in a penalty
charge of $18.88 million before tax or $12.46 million after tax. The convertible
advances had a weighted average interest rate of 6.25% and an average term to
maturity of approximately 5.61 years. The Bank replaced the advances plus the
penalty with a structure of maturities ranging up to 5 years. The weighted
average cost on the restructured borrowings was 3.59%.

Camco's CEO and President Richard C. Baylor, commented, "We fully anticipate
that this decision will have positive effects on the Bank's earnings and
performance ratios over the next several years and continues our focus of
growing shareholder value and producing consistent long-term total returns."



                                       5

Baylor continued, "The transaction positions itself well in our balance sheet as
a result of our recent and continuing efforts to manage towards shorter duration
assets generated from commercial/commercial real estate and consumer loans. As
of September 30, 2004, commercial/commercial real estate and consumer loans
comprised 25% and 14% of the loan portfolio, respectively. This is in line with
our long-term strategic plan objectives of reaching 30% and 20% or more for
commercial/commercial real estate and consumer loans, respectively."

Baylor continued, "The immediate impact of the restructuring is estimated to
reduce interest expense for the Corporation by over $3.33 million in the first
year on a pre-tax basis and $2.20 million on an after tax basis. It is
anticipated the first year incremental increase on earnings per share for the
Corporation will be $.30. Management expects this transaction will assist the
Corporation in achieving a return on average tangible equity in excess of 10%
and improve the Corporation's net interest margin by approximately 31 basis
points. Although the prepayment will reduce capital, the Corporation will remain
well capitalized by all regulatory standards. The ratio of tangible equity to
assets at December 31, 2005 is expected to be approximately 7.61%. Based on our
analysis, we believe this investment of capital produces attractive benefits to
our earnings outlook for the next several years and positions our company for
solid future growth."

Camco Financial Corporation, holding company for Advantage Bank, is a
multi-state financial holding company headquartered in Cambridge, Ohio with
assets of $1.1 billion. Advantage Bank and its affiliates offer community
banking, mortgage banking, internet banking and title services from 30 offices
in 35 communities in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia.
