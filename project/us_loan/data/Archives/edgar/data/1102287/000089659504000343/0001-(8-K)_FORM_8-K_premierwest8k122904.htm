<P>
<U><FONT size=2 face="serif">2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Agreements</FONT></U><FONT size=2 face="serif"> </FONT></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> <FONT size=2 face="serif"> On December 27, 2004, PremierWest Bank, the registrant's
    primary subsidiary, entered into the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation
    Agreements with the following four executive officers of the registrant and
    PremierWest Bank: John Anhorn, Richard Hieb, Tom Anderson, and Jim Earley.
    These agreements provide a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which
    the executives may elect to defer compensation earned after January 1, 2005.
    John Anhorn and Richard Hieb currently may defer compensation under Executive
    Deferred Compensation Agreements dated August 9, 2002, amended July 29, 2004,
    and Tom Anderson and Jim Earley currently may defer compensation under Executive
    Deferred Compensation Agreements dated July 29, 2004. No further compensation
    will be deferred under these agreements after December 31, 2004. </FONT></p>
  <p> <FONT size=2 face="serif"> The 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Agreements
    are intended to ensure that compensation deferred after December 31, 2004
    complies with the new Internal Revenue Code rules governing nonqualified deferred
    compensation adopted pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Consistent
    with the terms of the prior deferred compensation agreements, the executives
    may elect to defer up to 75% of their base salary and bonus compensation on
    an annual basis. The deferred amount accrues interest prior to commencement
    of distributions to the executive at the rate equal to PremierWest Bank's
    annual return on equity for that year, with a maximum interest rate of 18%
    and a minimum interest rate of 7%. Following a change in control or commencement
    of distributions, interest will accrue at Prime Rate. If the executive retires
    after normal retirement age, distributions begin six months after retirement.
    If the executive's employment terminates earlier, distributions will begin
    the later of six months after termination of employment or following the executive's
    final receipt of severance benefit, if any. In the event of permanent disability
    or death, distributions will begin the following month. Distributions may
    also be made earlier in the event of an unforeseeable emergency, as permitted
    under the Internal Revenue Code rules. </FONT></p>

<P>
<U><FONT size=2 face="serif">Amendment to Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreements</FONT></U><FONT size=2 face="serif"> </FONT></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> <FONT size=2 face="serif"> On December 27, 2004, PremierWest Bank amended
    the Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan Agreements dated July 29, 2004
    between the bank and John Anhorn, Richard Hieb, Tom Anderson, and Jim Earley,
    respectively (the &quot;SERP Agreements&quot;). The amendments bring the SERP
    Agreements into compliance with the new Internal Revenue Code rules governing
    nonqualified deferred compensation by providing that distributions will not
    begin until six months after termination of employment and by including the
    Internal Revenue Code restrictions on changes in the form and timing of distributions.

<P>
<U><FONT size=2 face="serif">Amendment to Employment Agreements</FONT></U><FONT size=2 face="serif"> </FONT></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> <FONT size=2 face="serif"> On December 27, 2004, the registrant amended
    the Employment Agreements dated July 29, 2004 by and among PremierWest Bancorp,
    PremierWest Bank and John Anhorn and Richard Hieb, respectively. The amendment,
    which is identical for both executives, extends the registrant's payment of
    health care insurance premiums for the executive and his spouse following
    the executive's retirement from 15 years, as previously written, to a life
    benefit. The executive and his spouse receive health insurance coverage substantially
    similar to that provided for registrant's or PremierWest Bank's employees
    until the eligible age for Medicare, after which time they will receive Medicare
    Supplemental Insurance until death. The amendment conforms the retiree health
    care benefit provided to these executives, who are also directors, to that
    provided for outside directors. </FONT></p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <FONT size=2 face="serif"> On December 27, 2004, PremierWest Bank entered
    into the 2005 Director Deferred Compensation Agreements with each of the outside
    directors of the registrant and PremierWest Bank. Under the terms of these
    agreements, after January 1, 2004, the director may defer receipt of any portion
    of the director's fees. The deferred amount accrues interest prior to commencement
    of distributions to the director at the rate equal to the PremierWest Bank's
    annual return on equity for that year, with a maximum interest rate of 18%
    and a minimum interest rate of 7%. Following a change in control or commencement
    of distributions, interest will accrue at Prime Rate. The deferred compensation
    will be distributed to the director starting six months after termination
    of the director's service or in the event of death or disability, the following
    month. Distributions may also be made earlier in the event of an unforeseeable
    emergency, as permitted under the Internal Revenue Code rules. </FONT></p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <FONT size=2 face="serif"> On December 27, 2004, PremierWest Bank entered
    into Continuing Benefits Agreements with each of the outside directors of
    the registrant and PremierWest Bank. Under the terms of the agreements, during
    the director's service as a director, at the director's expense, the director,
    the director's spouse, and the director's dependents are entitled to participate
    in any group medical, dental, vision, and accidental death and dismemberment
    insurance policies generally available to the employees of the registrant
    or PremierWest Bank. The director is eligible for benefits following termination
    of service if certain requirements are met, including that the director has
    served a minimum of ten years (with credit for service as a director of an
    institution acquired by the registrant more than two years prior to resignation)
    or served a minimum of five years if a change in control has occurred. If
    the director is eligible for post-service benefits, the director and the director's
    spouse are entitled, at the bank's expense, to insurance coverage under the
    group insurance plans until age 65, at which time the person is entitled to
    a Medicare Supplemental Insurance coverage until death. If the director or
    the director's spouse declines participation in an insurance program or is
    not eligible under the insurance program to participate, the director or the
    director's spouse will receive the cash equivalent of the premium that would
    have been paid by the bank. </FONT></p>

    At the end of each Plan Year under this Agreement, but only until a Change

    rate equal to the Bank's ROE (return on equity) for that Plan Year, compounded
    monthly, with a maximum crediting rate of 18% and a minimum credit rate of
    7%. In the event the Director and the Bank do not agree on what the Bank's
    ROE was for a particular Plan Year, the Director and the Bank agree that the
    ROE shall be derived from the quarterly report of condition filed by the Bank
    with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation year under Section 7(a) of
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Act for the fourth quarter of any year. If a
    Change in Control has occurred or payments have commenced, the Bank will not
    continue to credit interest pursuant to the ROE formula but rather will credit
    interest at an annual rate of interest, compounded monthly, on the remaining
    account balance during any applicable installment period, equal to the highest
    &quot;Prime Rate&quot; as published in the Wall Street Journal's &quot;Money
    Rates&quot; section. The interest credited each Plan Year shall be determined
