On July 15, 2003, Loral Space & Communications Ltd. and certain of its
subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of
title 11 of the United States Code in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and parallel insolvency proceedings in the Supreme
Court of Bermuda in which certain partners of KPMG LLP were appointed as joint
provisional liquidators.

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.

         Space Systems/Loral, Inc. ("SS/L"), a subsidiary of the Registrant,

fifth SS/L-built satellite in the EchoStar fleet. The contract is subject to
