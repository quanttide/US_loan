Forward Looking Statements and Other Information

This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements which have been
prepared by management of MDC Partners.

Management of MDC Partners may also make forward-looking statements orally from
time to time. Statements in this document that are not historical facts,
including statements about the Company's beliefs and expectations, particularly
regarding recent business and economic trends, estimates of amounts for
deferred acquisition consideration and "put" option rights, constitute
forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans,
estimates and projections, and are subject to change based on a number of
factors, including those outlined in this section. Forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future
events.Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A
number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Such risk factors
include, but are not limited to, the following:
o risks associated with effects of national and regional economic and political
conditions;
o the Company's ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients;
o the financial success of the Company's clients;
o the Company's ability to retain and attract key employees;
o developments from changes in the regulatory and legal environment;
o foreign currency fluctuations;
o risks arising from the Company's need to restate its financial statements;
o risks arising from potential material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting; and
o the successful completion and integration of acquisitions which complement
and expand the Company's' business capabilities. Investors should carefully
consider these risk factors and the additional risk factors outlined in more
detail in the Company's SEC filings.

   result of disposition.

   change in the inventory balances in certain Secured Products businesses.
