any of its obligations hereunder;

relieve  the  Purchaser  or any  Seller  of any  liability  for a breach of this
Agreement.

          4.3       Capitalization.

          (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 10,000,000
shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"). As of the
date hereof,  there are 4,570,000  shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
and 5,430,000  shares of Common Stock are held by the Company as treasury stock.
All of the issued and  outstanding  shares of Common Stock were duly  authorized
for issuance and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

          (b)  Except as set forth in the  attached  Schedule  4.3,  there is no
existing  option,  warrant,  call,  right,  commitment or other agreement of any
character to which any Seller or the Company is a party requiring, and there are
no securities of the Company outstanding which upon conversion or exchange would
require,  the  issuance,  sale or transfer of any  additional  shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of the Company or other securities  convertible
into,  exchangeable  for or  evidencing  the right to subscribe  for or purchase
shares of capital stock or other equity  securities of the Company.  None of the
Sellers nor the Company is a party to any voting trust or other voting agreement
with respect to any of the shares of Common Stock or to any  agreement  relating
to the issuance, sale, redemption,  transfer or other disposition of the capital
stock of the Company.

          4.4       Subsidiaries.

          Schedule  4.4  hereto  sets forth the name of each  subsidiary  of the
Company  (each a  "Subsidiary"),  and,  with  respect  to each  Subsidiary,  the
jurisdiction  in which it is incorporated or organized,  the  jurisdictions,  if
any,  in which it is  qualified  to do  business,  the  number  of shares of its
authorized capital stock, the number and class of shares thereof duly issued and

are  owned by it free and  clear of any and all  liens,  pledges,  encumbrances,
charges,  agreements  or claims of any kind  whatsoever,  except as set forth in
Schedule 4.4 hereto.  No shares of capital  stock are held by any  Subsidiary as
treasury  stock.  There is no existing  option,  warrant,  call,  commitment  or
agreement  to which  any  Subsidiary  is a party  requiring,  and  there  are no
convertible securities of any Subsidiary outstanding which upon conversion would
require,  the issuance of any additional shares of capital stock or other equity
interests  of any  Subsidiary  or other  securities  convertible  into shares of
capital  stock or other  equity  interests  of any  Subsidiary  or other  equity
security of any  Subsidiary.  Each  Subsidiary  is a duly  organized and validly
existing  corporation  or other  entity in good  standing  under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its  reorganization  and is duly qualified to do business and is
in good  standing  under the laws of (i) each  jurisdiction  in which it owns or
leases real  property and (ii) each other  jurisdiction  in which the conduct of
its business or the ownership of its assets requires such qualification,  except
where a failure to be so qualified  would not have a Material  Adverse Effect on
the  business,  assets or financial  condition  of Company and its  Subsidiaries
taken  as a  whole.  Each  Subsidiary  has all  requisite  corporate  power  and
authority  to own  its  properties  and  carry  on  its  business  as  presently
conducted.

          The Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  is in  compliance  with all
Laws  applicable  to the Company and its  Subsidiaries  or to the conduct of the
business or operations of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  or the use of their
respective  properties  (including any leased properties) and assets, except for
such  non-compliances  as would not,  individually  or in the aggregate,  have a
Material  Adverse  Effect.  The  Company  and each of its  Subsidiaries  has all
governmental  permits and  approvals  from state,  federal or local  authorities
which are required for the Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  to operate its

any  outstanding  written  order or Contract  with any  governmental  authority,
person or entity  respecting  Environmental  Laws or any  violation or potential
violations thereof;

written  communication  alleging  either or both that the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may be in violation of any Environmental  Law, or any permit issued
pursuant to Environmental Law, or may have any liability under any Environmental
Law;

          4.21      Insurance.

          Schedule  4.21 sets forth a complete and accurate list of all policies
of  insurance  of  any  kind  or  nature  covering  the  Company  or  any of its

consistent with past practice and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

          (b) All accounts  receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries  have
arisen from bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice.  All accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries
reflected  on the  Balance  Sheet  are good  and  collectible  at the  aggregate
recorded amounts thereof,  net of any applicable reserve for returns or doubtful
accounts reflected thereon, which reserves are adequate and were calculated in a
manner  consistent with past practice and in accordance  with GAAP  consistently
applied.  All accounts  receivable arising after the Balance Sheet Date are good
and collectible at the aggregate recorded amounts thereof, net of any applicable
reserve for returns or doubtful  accounts,  which reserves are adequate and were
calculated in a manner consistent with past practice and in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied.

          (c) All accounts payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected
in the Balance  Sheet or arising  after the date  thereof are the result of bona
fide  transactions  in the ordinary course of business and have been paid or are

consultant  to, or lender to or borrower from or has the right to participate in
the  profits  of,  any  person or entity  which is (A) a  competitor,  supplier,
customer,  landlord,  tenant,  creditor  or debtor of the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries,  (B) engaged in a business  related to the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) a participant in any transaction to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) is a party to any Contract

          4.24      Banks.

          Schedule  4.24  contains a complete  and correct list of the names and
locations of all banks in which Company or any  Subsidiary  has accounts or safe
deposit boxes and the names of all persons authorized to draw thereon or to have
access thereto. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25, no person holds a power of
attorney to act on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary.

          4.25      No Misrepresentation.

          No  representation  or  warranty  of  any  Seller  contained  in  this
Agreement or in any schedule  hereto or in any  certificate or other  instrument
furnished by any Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof,  contains
any  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omits to state a  material  fact
necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading.

          4.26      Investment Intent.

          The Purchase  Shares are being  acquired  hereunder by the Sellers for
investment  purposes only, for their own account,  not as a nominee or agent and
not  with a view to the  distribution  thereof.  The  Sellers  have  no  present
intention to sell or otherwise  dispose of the Purchase Shares and they will not
do so except in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended,  and applicable  law. The Sellers  understand  that the Purchase Shares
acquired  hereunder  must  be  held by them  indefinitely  unless  a  subsequent
disposition or transfer of any of said shares is registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or is exempt from registration  therefrom.  The Sellers
further  understand  that the exemption from  registration  afforded by Rule 144
(the  provisions  of which  are  known to such  Sellers)  promulgated  under the
Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  depends on the  satisfaction  of various
conditions, and that, if and when applicable,  Rule 144 may afford the basis for
sales only in limited amounts.

          4.27      Financial Advisors.

          Except as set forth on Schedule  4.27,  no person or entity has acted,
directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor for the Sellers
or the  Company  in  connection  with  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement  and no person or entity is entitled to any fee or  commission or like
payment in respect thereof.

          4.28      Accreditation.

          Each  Seller is an  "accredited  investor"  within the meaning of Rule
501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The Sellers  understand  that the Purchase  Shares are being  offered to them in
reliance upon specific  exemptions from the registration  requirements of United
States federal and state  securities laws and that the Purchaser is relying upon
the  truth  and   accuracy   of,  and  the   Sellers'   compliance   with,   the
representations,  warranties, agreements,  acknowledgments and understandings of
the Sellers set forth  herein in order to  determine  the  availability  of such
exemptions and the eligibility of the Sellers to acquire the Purchase Shares.

          4.29      Investment Experience; Suitability.

          Each  Seller  is  familiar  with  the type of  risks  inherent  in the
acquisition of securities  such as the shares of the Purchaser and each Seller's
financial  position  is such that the Seller  can afford to retain its  Purchase
Shares for an indefinite period of time without realizing any direct or indirect
cash return on its investment.

          (a) Neither of the  execution  and  delivery by the  Purchaser of this
Agreement and of the Purchaser  Documents,  nor the  compliance by the Purchaser
with any of the  provisions  hereof or thereof will (i) conflict with, or result

of the  Purchaser,  (ii)  conflict  with,  violate,  result in the breach of, or

Purchaser or its  properties  or assets are bound or (iii)  violate any statute,
rule, regulation, order or decree of any governmental body or authority by which
the Purchaser is bound,  except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such
violations, breaches or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  business,  properties,  results  of
operations,  prospects, conditions (financial or otherwise) of the Purchaser and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (b) No consent, waiver,  approval,  Order, Permit or authorization of,

transactions contemplated hereby.

          5.5       Investment Intention.

          The  Purchaser  is  acquiring  the  Shares  for its own  account,  for
investment  purposes only and not with a view to the  distribution (as such term
is used in  Section  2(11)  of the  Securities  Act of  1933,  as  amended  (the
"Securities Act") thereof.  Purchaser  understands that the Shares have not been
registered  under the  Securities  Act and  cannot be sold  unless  subsequently
registered  under the Securities Act or an exemption from such  registration  is
available.

          5.6       Financial Advisors.

          No Person has acted,  directly or indirectly,  as a broker,  finder or
financial  advisor  for  the  Purchaser  in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and no  person  is  entitled  to  any  fee or
commission or like payment in respect thereof.

          (a) Except as set forth on Schedule  5.7, (A) all material tax returns
required  to be  filed by or on  behalf  of the  Purchaser  have  been  properly

all  jurisdictions  in which such tax  returns are  required to be filed  (after

                                       18
<PAGE>
and all such tax  returns  were  true,  complete  and  correct  in all  material
respects;  (B) all amounts  shown on such tax returns  (including  interest  and
penalties)  as due from the  Purchaser  have been  fully and  timely  paid,  and
adequate  reserves  or  accruals  for taxes have been  provided  in  Purchaser's
balance sheet with respect to any period for which tax returns have not yet been
filed or for which taxes are not yet due and owing;  and (C) the  Purchaser  has
not executed or filed with the IRS or any other taxing  authority any agreement,
waiver or other  document  or  arrangement  extending  or having  the  effect of
extending the period for assessment or collection of taxes  (including,  but not
limited to, any applicable statute of limitation), and no power of attorney with
respect to any tax matter is currently in force.

amounts  required  to be so  withheld  and paid over for all  periods  under all
applicable laws.

          (c) Schedule  5.7 lists all material  types of taxes paid and material
types of tax returns filed by or on behalf of the Purchaser. Except as set forth

to taxation by that jurisdiction.

          (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.7, all deficiencies  asserted or
assessments  made as a result of any examinations by the IRS or any other taxing
authority of the tax returns of or covering or including the Purchaser have been
fully  paid,  and there  are no other  audits or  investigations  by any  taxing
authority in progress, nor has the Purchaser received any notice from any taxing
authority  that it intends to conduct such an audit or  investigation.  No issue
has been raised by a federal,  state,  local or foreign taxing  authority in any
current  or prior  examination  which,  by  application  of the same or  similar
principles,  could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency for
any subsequent taxable period.

IRS or comparable rulings of other taxing authorities.

business or operations of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries or the use of their
respective  properties  (including any leased properties) and assets, except for
such  non-compliances  as would not,  individually  or in the aggregate,  have a

governmental  permits and  approvals  from state,  federal or local  authorities
which are required for the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries to operate its
business,  except for those the absence of which would not,  individually  or in

written  communication  alleging either or both that the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries may be in violation of any Environmental  Law, or any permit issued

Agreement or in any schedule  hereto or in any  certificate or other  instrument
furnished  by the  Purchaser  to the  Company or Sellers  pursuant  to the terms
hereof,  contains any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements  contained  herein or therein not
misleading

its  Subsidiaries  and such  examination  of the books,  records  and  financial
condition of the Company and its  Subsidiaries as it reasonably  requests and to
make extracts and copies of such books and records.  Any such  investigation and
examination   shall  be  conducted  during  regular  business  hours  and  under
reasonable  circumstances,  and the Sellers shall cooperate, and shall cause the
Company and its  Subsidiaries to cooperate,  fully therein.  No investigation by
the Purchaser  prior to or after the date of this  Agreement  shall  diminish or
obviate any of the representations,  warranties,  covenants or agreements of the
Sellers contained in this Agreement or the Seller  Documents.  In order that the
Purchaser may have full opportunity to make such physical, business,  accounting
and legal review,  examination or investigation as it may reasonably  request of
the  affairs of the Company and its  Subsidiaries,  the Sellers  shall cause the
officers,  employees,  consultants,  agents,  accountants,  attorneys  and other
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate fully with such
representatives in connection with such review and examination.

provide  services to the Company during the Post-Closing  Period,  Purchaser and
the Sellers  shall  negotiate in good faith the terms for any such  services and

its EBITDA goals set forth in Section 2.1(b).

          9.2       Limitations    on    Indemnification    for    Breaches   of
                    Representations and Warranties.

          An  indemnifying  party  shall not have any  liability  under  Section
9.1(a)(ii) or Section 9.1(b)(i) hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses and
Expenses to the indemnified parties finally determined to arise thereunder based
upon,  attributable  to or resulting from the failure of any  representation  or
warranty to be true and correct  exceeds  $15,000  (the  "Basket")  and, in such
event, the indemnifying party shall be required to pay the entire amount of such
Losses and  Expenses  in excess of $15,000  (the  "Deductible").  Further,  each
Seller's liability under Section 9.1 shall be limited to the amount of and shall
be in the same form (i.e.,  cash and/or Purchase Shares) of the Initial Purchase
Price and the Additional Purchase Price received by that Seller. For purposes of
this  Section 9, the per share  value of the  Purchase  Shares  shall  equal the
average daily weighted volume average price of Purchaser's  common stock for the
fifteen  (15)  trading  days  prior to the date that any  liability  under  this
Section 9.1 arises.  In the event that the amount of liability under Section 9.1
exceeds  the value of the Initial  Purchase  Price and the  Additional  Purchase
Price as of the date that such liability arises, the Sellers shall fully satisfy
such  liability  by  returning  the cash and Purchase  Shares  representing  the
Initial Purchase Price and Additional Purchase Price to Purchaser.

          9.3       Indemnification Procedures.

          (a) In the event that any Legal  Proceedings  shall be  instituted  or
that any claim or demand ("Claim") shall be asserted by any Person in respect of
which payment may be sought under Section 9.1 hereof  (regardless  of the Basket
or the Deductible referred to above), the indemnified party shall reasonably and
promptly  cause  written  notice of the  assertion  of any Claim of which it has
knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying
party.  The  indemnifying  party  shall have the right,  at its sole  option and
expense,  to be represented  by counsel of its choice,  which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against,  negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder,  it shall within five (5) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Claim
so  requires)  notify  the  indemnified  party of its  intent  to do so.  If the
indemnifying party elects not to defend against,  negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses  indemnified  against hereunder,
fails to notify the  indemnified  party of its  election  as herein  provided or
contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under
this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against,  negotiate,  settle or
otherwise deal with such Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Claim, then
the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the Expenses of
defending  such Claim upon  submission of periodic  bills.  If the  indemnifying
party  shall  assume  the  defense  of any  Claim,  the  indemnified  party  may
participate,  at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Claim; provided,
however,  that such  indemnified  party shall be entitled to  participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying  party if,
(i) so  requested  by the  indemnifying  party  to  participate  or  (ii) in the
reasonable  opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the indemnified  party and the  indemnifying  party that
would make such separate representation  advisable; and provided,  further, that
the  indemnifying  party  shall  not be  required  to pay for more than one such
counsel for all indemnified  parties in connection  with any Claim.  The parties
hereto agree to cooperate  fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Claim.

          (b) After any final  judgment or award  shall have been  rendered by a
court,  arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and
the expiration of the time in which to appeal  therefrom,  or a settlement shall
have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding  agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying  party pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to such  matter and the  indemnifying  party shall be required to pay all of the
sums so due and owing to the  indemnified  party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within 10 business days after the date of such notice.

          (c) The failure of the  indemnified  party to give  reasonably  prompt
notice  of  any  Claim  shall  not  release,   waive  or  otherwise  affect  the
indemnifying  party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that
the indemnifying  party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of
such failure.

          9.4       Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

          The Sellers and the  Purchaser  agree to treat any  indemnity  payment
made pursuant to this Article 9 as an adjustment to the Initial  Purchase  Price

          10.2      Survival of Representations and Warranties.

          The  parties  hereto  hereby  agree  that  the   representations   and
warranties  contained  in this  Agreement  or in any  certificate,  document  or
instrument  delivered in  connection  herewith,  shall survive the execution and
delivery  of  this  Agreement,  and the  Closing  hereunder,  regardless  of any
investigation made by the parties hereto; provided,  however, that any claims or
actions with respect  thereto shall  terminate  unless within  twenty-four  (24)
months  after the  Closing  Date  written  notice of such claims is given to the

          10.3      Expenses.

          Except as otherwise  provided in this  Agreement,  the Sellers and the
Purchaser  shall each bear its own  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other  agreement,  document
and  instrument  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby,  it being  understood that in no
event shall the Company bear any of such costs and expenses.

          10.4      Specific Performance.

          The Sellers  acknowledge  and agree that the breach of this  Agreement
would cause irreparable  damage to the Purchaser and that the Purchaser will not
have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore,  the obligations of the Sellers under
this Agreement,  including,  without limitation, the Sellers' obligation to sell
the  Shares to the  Purchaser,  shall be  enforceable  by a decree  of  specific
performance  issued  by any court of  competent  jurisdiction,  and  appropriate
injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection  therewith.  Such
remedies  shall,  however,  be  cumulative  and not  exclusive  and  shall be in
addition to any other  remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or
otherwise.

          10.5      Further Assurances.

          The Sellers and the Purchaser  each agrees to execute and deliver such
other documents or agreements and to take such other action as may be reasonably
necessary  or  desirable  for  the  implementation  of  this  Agreement  and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          10.6      Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

          (a) The parties hereto hereby  irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction  of any  federal  or state  court  located  within the State of New
Jersey over any dispute  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or any of
the transactions  contemplated  hereby and each party hereby  irrevocably agrees
that all  claims in  respect  of such  dispute  or any suit,  action  proceeding
related  thereto may be heard and determined in such courts.  The parties hereby
irrevocably  waive,  to the fullest  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law, any
objection  which  they may now or  hereafter  have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient  forum for the
maintenance  of such dispute.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment
in any  such  dispute  may be  enforced  in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served
by any party to this Agreement in any suit,  action or proceeding by the mailing
of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.10.

          10.7      Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers.

          This  Agreement   (including   the  schedules  and  exhibits   hereto)
represents  the entire  understanding  and agreement  between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject  matter hereof and can be amended,  supplemented  or
changed,  and any  provision  hereof can be waived,  only by written  instrument
making  specific  reference to this  Agreement  signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought.
No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,  including without  limitation,  any
investigation  by or on behalf of any  party,  shall be deemed to  constitute  a
waiver by the party taking such action of  compliance  with any  representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto
of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed
as a further or continuing  waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay
in exercising,  any right,  power or remedy  hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy
by such party preclude any other or further  exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right,  power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.

          10.8      Governing  Law.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed  by and
                    construed  in  accordance  with the laws of the State of New
                    Jersey.

No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either the Sellers or the  Purchaser  (by operation of law or otherwise)
