          4                                    $400
          5                                    $500
          6                                    $600
          7                                    $700
          8                                    $800
          9                                    $900
          10                                   $1,000
          Over  10                             $1,000  +  $200  for  each
                                               Business Day late beyond 10 days

The Company shall pay any payments  incurred  under this Section in  immediately
available funds upon written demand by the Investor.  Nothing herein shall limit
the Investor's right to pursue actual damages for the Company's failure to issue
and deliver the Securities to the Investor,  except to the extent that such late
payments shall constitute payment for and offset any such actual damages alleged
by the Investor, and any Buy In Adjustment Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing
to the contrary,  the Company  shall not be liable for any late  payments  under
this  Section  2(H) if such  failure  is due to  causes  reasonably  beyond  the
Company's  control,  including  fire,  flood,  strikes,  labor troubles or other
industrial  disturbances,  riots and  insurrections,  war and acts of terrorism.
Upon the  occurrence of such a force majeure  event,  the Company shall promptly
notify the Investor  with as much detail as possible and shall  promptly  inform
the  Investor  of any  further  developments.  Immediately  after  the  cause is
removed, the Company shall perform its obligations with all due speed.

(I) OVERALL LIMIT ON COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE.  Notwithstanding  anything contained
herein to the contrary,  if during the Open Period the Company becomes listed on
an exchange  that limits the number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued
without shareholder approval,  then the number of Shares issuable by the Company
and  purchasable by the Investor,  including the shares of Common Stock issuable
to the  Investors,  shall not exceed that  number of the shares of Common  Stock
that may be  issuable  without  shareholder  approval,  subject  to  appropriate
adjustment  for stock splits,  stock  dividends,  combinations  or other similar
recapitalization   affecting  the  Common  Stock  (the  "Maximum   Common  Stock
Issuance"),  unless the  issuance of Shares,  including  any Common  Stock to be
issued to the  Investor  pursuant  to Section  11(b),  in excess of the  Maximum
Common Stock Issuance shall first be approved by the Company's  shareholders  in
accordance with applicable law and the By-laws and Articles of  Incorporation of
the Company,  if such issuance of shares of Common Stock could cause a delisting
on the Principal  Market.  The parties  understand  and agree that the Company's
failure to seek or obtain such  shareholder  approval  shall in no way adversely
affect the validity and due authorization of the issuance and sale of Securities
or the Investor's  obligation in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof
to purchase a number of Shares in the  aggregate up to the Maximum  Common Stock
Issuance  limitation,  and that such approval pertains only to the applicability
of the Maximum Common Stock Issuance limitation provided in this Section 2(i).

                                       14
<PAGE>

trademarks,  trade names,  service marks,  service mark  registrations,  service

necessary  to conduct its  business as now or as proposed to be  conducted  have
expired or  terminated,  or are expected to expire or  terminate  within two (2)
years from the date of this Agreement.  The Company and its  Subsidiaries do not
have any knowledge of any  infringement  by the Company or its  Subsidiaries  of
trademark,  trade name rights, patents, patent rights,  copyrights,  inventions,
licenses, service names, service marks, service mark registrations, trade secret
or other  similar  rights of others,  or of any such  development  of similar or
identical  trade secrets or technical  information by others and,  except as set

mark registrations,  trade secret or other infringement; and the Company and its
Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances  which might give rise to
any of the foregoing.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken  commercially
reasonable  security measures to protect the secrecy,  confidentiality and value
of all of their intellectual properties.

(M)  ENVIRONMENTAL  LAWS.  The  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  (I) are,  to the
knowledge  of  management  of the  Company,  in  compliance  with  any  and  all
applicable foreign,  federal,  state and local laws and regulations  relating to
the protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic
substances or wastes,  pollutants or contaminants  ("Environmental  Laws"); (II)
have,  to the  knowledge of  management  of the  Company,  received all permits,
licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws
to conduct their  respective  businesses;  and (III) are in  compliance,  to the
knowledge  of the  Company,  with all terms and  conditions  of any such permit,
license or approval where, in each of the three (3) foregoing cases, the failure

Effect.

(N) TITLE.  The Company and its  Subsidiaries  have good and marketable title to
all  personal  property  owned by them which is material to the  business of the
Company  and its  Subsidiaries,  in each  case  free  and  clear  of all  liens,
encumbrances  and defects  except such as are  described in the SEC Documents or
such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere
with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries.  Any real property and facilities  held under lease by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are held by them under valid,  subsisting and
enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere
with the use made and proposed to be made of such  property and buildings by the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(O)  INSURANCE.  Each of the Company's  Subsidiaries  are insured by insurers of
recognized  financial  responsibility  against such losses and risks and in such

                                       15
<PAGE>

amounts as  management  of the  Company  reasonably  believes  to be prudent and
customary  in the  businesses  in which the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  are
engaged.  Neither  the  Company  nor any such  Subsidiary  has been  refused any
insurance  coverage  sought or applied  for and neither the Company nor any such
Subsidiary  has any  reason  to  believe  that it will not be able to renew  its
existing  insurance  coverage  as and when such  coverage  expires  or to obtain
similar  coverage  from  similar  insurers as may be  necessary  to continue its
business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(P) REGULATORY PERMITS.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have in full force and
effect  all  certificates,   approvals,  authorizations  and  permits  from  the
appropriate  federal,   state,  local  or  foreign  regulatory  authorities  and
comparable foreign regulatory agencies, necessary to own, lease or operate their
respective  properties and assets and conduct their respective  businesses,  and
neither  the  Company  nor any  such  Subsidiary  has  received  any  notice  of
proceedings  relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate,
approval,  authorization  or permit,  except for such  certificates,  approvals,
authorizations  or  permits  which  if not  obtained,  or  such  revocations  or
modifications  which,  would not have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  (Q) INTERNAL
ACCOUNTING CONTROLS.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable  assurance that
(I)  transactions  are  executed  in  accordance  with  management's  general or
specific  authorizations;  (II) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  by a firm with  membership  to the PCAOB and to maintain
asset  accountability;  (III) access to assets is permitted  only in  accordance
with  management's  general or  specific  authorization;  and (IV) the  recorded
accountability  for assets is compared  with the existing  assets at  reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

(R) NO MATERIALLY  ADVERSE  CONTRACTS,  ETC.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any charter, corporate or other legal restriction, or
any judgment,  decree,  order,  rule or regulation  which in the judgment of the
Company's  officers has or is expected in the future to have a Material  Adverse
Effect.  Neither  the  Company  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is a party  to any
contract or agreement which in the judgment of the Company's  officers has or is
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(S) TAX STATUS.  The Company and each of its  Subsidiaries has made or filed all
United  States  federal and state income and all other tax returns,  reports and
declarations  required by any  jurisdiction  to which it is subject  (unless and
only to the extent that the Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  has set aside
on its books  provisions  reasonably  adequate for the payment of all unpaid and
unreported taxes) and has paid all taxes and other governmental  assessments and
charges  that are  material  in amount,  shown or  determined  to be due on such

                                       16
<PAGE>

returns,  reports and  declarations,  except those being contested in good faith
and has set aside on its books provision  reasonably adequate for the payment of
all taxes for periods  subsequent to the periods to which such returns,  reports
or declarations  apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed
to be due by the taxing authority of any  jurisdiction,  and the officers of the
Company know of no basis for any such claim.

(T)  CERTAIN  TRANSACTIONS.  Except as set forth in the SEC  Documents  filed at
least  ten (10) days  prior to the date  hereof  and  except  for  arm's  length
transactions pursuant to which the Company makes payments in the ordinary course
of business  upon terms no less  favorable  than the Company  could  obtain from
third  parties and other than the grant of stock  options  disclosed  in the SEC
Documents,  none of the  officers,  directors,  or  employees  of the Company is
presently a party to any transaction with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than for services as employees,  officers and  directors),  including any
contract,  agreement  or  other  arrangement  providing  for the  furnishing  of
services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from,
or  otherwise  requiring  payments  to or from  any  officer,  director  or such
employee  or, to the  knowledge of the Company,  any  corporation,  partnership,
trust or other entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a
substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner.

(U) DILUTIVE EFFECT. The Company understands and acknowledges that the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon  purchases  pursuant to this Agreement will
increase in certain circumstances including, but not necessarily limited to, the
circumstance  wherein the trading price of the Common Stock declines  during the
period between the Effective Date and the end of the Open Period.  The Company's
executive officers and directors have studied and fully understand the nature of
the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and recognize that they have a
potential  dilutive effect. The Board of Directors of the Company has concluded,
in its good faith business judgment, that such issuance is in the best interests
of the Company.  The Company  specifically  acknowledges  that,  subject to such
limitations  as are  expressly  set  forth  in the  Transaction  Documents,  its
obligation  to issue  shares of Common  Stock upon  purchases  pursuant  to this
Agreement is absolute and  unconditional  regardless of the dilutive effect that
such issuance may have on the ownership  interests of other  shareholders of the
Company.

(V)  ADDITIONAL  FINANCING:  During the Open Period,  the Company shall have the
right to finance the Company with any third party,  provided  that the financing
is not an Equity Line or similar financing structure.

any person acting on its behalf, has engaged in any form of general solicitation
or general  advertising  (within the meaning of Regulation D) in connection with
the offer or sale of the Common Stock offered hereby.

prospectus.  The Company shall not deliver to Investor any Put Notice during the
continuation of any of the foregoing events.

(L)  REIMBURSEMENT.  If (I)  Investor  becomes  involved in any  capacity in any
action,  proceeding or investigation  brought by any shareholder of the Company,
in  connection  with or as a  result  of the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  by the Transaction  Documents,  or if Investor is impleaded in any
such action,  proceeding or  investigation by any person (other than as a result
of a breach of the Investor's  representations  and warranties set forth in this
Agreement);  or (II)  Investor  becomes  involved in any capacity in any action,
proceeding or investigation  brought by the SEC against or involving the Company
or in connection  with or as a result of the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (other than as a result of a breach of
the Investor's  representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement),  or
if Investor is impleaded in any such action,  proceeding or investigation by any

Investor,  for the time of any  officers or  employees  of  Investor  devoted to

SECTION 6. COVER.

If the number of Shares  represented by any Put Notice (s) become  restricted or
are no longer freely trading for any reason (other than as a result of an action
of the Investor), and after the applicable Closing Date, the Investor purchases,
in an open market  transaction  or otherwise,  the  Company's  Common Stock (the
"Covering Shares") in order to make delivery in satisfaction of a sale of Common
Stock  by the  Investor  (the  "Sold  Shares"),  which  delivery  such  Investor
anticipated to make using the Shares represented by the Put Notice (a "Buy-In"),
the Company shall pay to the Investor the Buy-In  Adjustment  Amount (as defined
below).  The "Buy-In  Adjustment  Amount" is the amount equal to the excess,  if
any,  of  (A)  the  Investor's   total  purchase  price   (including   brokerage
commissions,  if any) for the Covering  Shares over (B) the net proceeds  (after
brokerage  commissions,  if any)  received by the Investor  from the sale of the
Sold Shares.

                                       21
<PAGE>

The  Company  shall  pay  the  Buy-In  Adjustment  Amount  to  the  Investor  in
immediately  available funds immediately upon demand by the Investor.  By way of
illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing,  if the Investor  purchases
Common Stock having a total purchase price (including brokerage  commissions) of
$11,000  to cover a Buy-In  with  respect  to the  Common  Stock it sold for net
proceeds of $10,000,  the Buy-In  Adjustment  Amount  which the Company  will be
required to pay to the Investor will be $1,000.

with  respect  to such  Registration  Statement  or that the SEC  otherwise  has
suspended or withdrawn the effectiveness of such Registration Statement,  either
temporarily  or  permanently,  or intends or has threatened to do so (unless the
SEC's concerns have been addressed and Investor is reasonably satisfied that the
SEC no longer is considering or intends to take such action),  and (II) no other
suspension of the use or withdrawal of the  effectiveness  of such  Registration

or

                                       23

shareholders,  officers,  directors,  employees, counsel, and direct or indirect
investors  and any of the  foregoing  person's  agents or other  representatives

from and against any and all actions,  causes of action, suits, claims,  losses,
costs,  penalties,  fees,  liabilities and damages,  and reasonable  expenses in
connection therewith  (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to

reasonable  attorneys' fees and disbursements  (the "Indemnified  Liabilities"),

a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any default or breach
of any  provision  of this  Agreement,  including  the  recovery  of  reasonable
attorneys fees and costs, and to exercise all other rights granted by law.

payments to the Investor hereunder or under the Registration Rights Agreement or

or otherwise  restored to the Company,  a trustee,  receiver or any other person
under any law  (including,  without  limitation,  any  bankruptcy  law, state or
