Agreement.

         Section 2.  REGISTRATION.

         (a) The  Company  shall,  as soon as  practicable,  but not later  than
forty-five  (45) calendar days following the Execution of this  agreement,  file
with  the  SEC a  Registration  Statement  or  Registration  Statements  (as  is
necessary)  on  Form  SB-2  (or,  if  such  form  is  unavailable   for  such  a
registration,  on such  other  form as is  available  for such a  registration),
covering the resale of all of the  Registrable  Securities,  which  Registration
Statement(s) shall state that, in accordance with Rule 416 promulgated under the
1933 Act, such Registration  Statement also covers such indeterminate  number of
additional  shares of Common  Stock as may become  issuable  upon stock  splits,
stock dividends or similar  transactions.  The Company shall initially  register
for resale  6,000,000 shares of Common Stock which would be issuable on the date
preceding  the filing of the  Registration  Statement  based on the  closing bid
price of the  Company's  Common  Stock on such  date and the  amount  reasonably
calculated that  represents  Common Stock issuable to other parties as set forth
in the Investment Agreement except to the extent that the SEC requires the share
amount to be reduced as a condition of effectiveness.

         (b) The Company shall use commercially  reasonable  efforts to have the
Registration  Statement(s)  declared  effective  by the SEC within  one  hundred
twenty (120) calendar days after the Execution Date.

         (c) The  Company  agrees not to  include  any other  securities  in the
Registration  Statement other than the Registrable Securities and any securities
issuable to the placement agent in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the  Investment  Agreement  without  Investor's  prior written  consent which
Investor may withhold in its sole  discretion.  Furthermore,  the Company agrees
that it will not file any other  Registration  Statement  for other  securities,
until thirty calendar days after the Registration  Statement for the Registrable
Securities is declared effective by the SEC.

         Section 3.  RELATED OBLIGATIONS.

         At such  time  as the  Company  is  obligated  to  prepare  and  file a
Registration  Statement  with the SEC pursuant to Section 2(a), the Company will
effect the  registration  of the  Registrable  Securities in accordance with the
intended method of disposition  thereof and, with respect  thereto,  the Company
shall have the following obligations:

         (a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration   Statement  relating  to  the  Registrable  Securities  to  become
effective  within one hundred  twenty  (120) days after the  Execution  Date and
shall keep such Registration  Statement  effective until the earlier to occur of
(i) the date on which  (A) the  Investor  shall  have  sold all the  Registrable
Securities;  and (B) the Investor has no right to acquire any additional  shares
of Common Stock under the Investment Agreement (the "Registration  Period"). The
Registration  Statement  (including any  amendments or  supplements  thereto

                                       2
<PAGE>

and prospectuses  contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they  were  made,  not  misleading.  The  Company  shall  use  its  commercially
reasonable  best efforts to respond to all SEC comments within ten (10) business
days from  receipt of such  comments by the Company.  The Company  shall use its
commercially  reasonable  best  efforts  to  cause  the  Registration  Statement
relating to the Registrable  Securities to become  effective no later than three
(3) business days after notice from the SEC that the Registration  Statement may
be declared  effective.  The Investor agrees to provide all information which it
is required by law to provide to the Company,  including the intended  method of
disposition of the  Registrable  Securities,  and the Company's  obligations set
forth above shall be conditioned on the receipt of such information.

         (b) The Company  shall  prepare  and file with the SEC such  amendments
(including   post-effective   amendments)  and  supplements  to  a  Registration
Statement  and  the  prospectus  used  in  connection  with  such   Registration
Statement,  which  prospectus  is to be filed  pursuant to Rule 424  promulgated
under the 1933 Act,  as may be  necessary  to keep such  Registration  Statement
effective during the Registration  Period, and, during such period,  comply with
the  provisions  of  the  1933  Act  with  respect  to  the  disposition  of all
Registrable  Securities of the Company  covered by such  Registration  Statement
until such time as all of such  Registrable  Securities shall have been disposed
of in  accordance  with the  intended  methods of  disposition  by the  Investor
thereof as set forth in such Registration  Statement. In the event the number of
shares of Common Stock covered by a  Registration  Statement  filed  pursuant to
this  Agreement  is at any time  insufficient  to cover  all of the  Registrable
Securities,  the Company shall amend such Registration  Statement, or file a new
Registration Statement (on the short form available therefor, if applicable), or
both, so as to cover all of the Registrable Securities, in each case, as soon as
practicable,  but in any  event  within  thirty  (30)  calendar  days  after the
necessity  therefor arises (based on the then Purchase Price of the Common Stock
and other  relevant  factors on which the  Company  reasonably  elects to rely),
assuming the Company has  sufficient  authorized  shares at that time, and if it
does not, within thirty (30) calendar days after such shares are authorized. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment and/or
new Registration  Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following
the filing thereof.

         (c) The Company shall make available to the Investor whose  Registrable
Securities  are included in any  Registration  Statement  and its legal  counsel
without charge (i) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC at
least one (1) copy of such Registration  Statement and any amendment(s) thereto,
including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein
by reference  and all exhibits,  the  prospectus  included in such  Registration
Statement  (including  each  preliminary  prospectus)  and, with regards to such
Registration Statement(s),  any correspondence by or on behalf of the Company to
the SEC or the staff of the SEC and any correspondence from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC to the Company or its representatives; (ii) upon the effectiveness of
any  Registration  Statement,  the Company  shall make  available  copies of the
prospectus,   via  EDGAR,  included  in  such  Registration  Statement  and  all
amendments and supplements  thereto;  and (iii) such other documents,  including
copies of any  preliminary or final  prospectus,  as the Investor may reasonably
request  from  time  to time in  order  to  facilitate  the  disposition  of the
Registrable Securities.

         (d) The  Company  shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to (i)
register  and  qualify  the  Registrable  Securities  covered by a  Registration
Statement  under such other  securities or "blue sky" laws of such states in the
United  States as any  Investor  reasonably  requests;  (ii) prepare and file in
those jurisdictions,  such amendments (including post-effective  amendments) and
supplements  to such  registrations  and  qualifications  as may be necessary to
maintain the effectiveness  thereof during the Registration  Period;  (iii) take
such other  actions as may be  necessary  to  maintain  such  registrations  and
qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration  Period,  and (iv)
take all  other  actions  reasonably  necessary  or  advisable  to  qualify  the
Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions;  provided,  however, that
the  Company  shall not be required in  connection  therewith  or as a condition
thereto to (x)  qualify to do business  in any  jurisdiction  where it would not
otherwise  be  required  to qualify but for this  Section  3(d),  or (y) subject
itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction.  The Company shall promptly
notify each  Investor  who holds  Registrable  Securities  of the receipt by the
Company of any  notification  with respect to the suspension of the registration
or  qualification  of any of the  Registrable  Securities  for

                                       3
<PAGE>

sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any  jurisdiction  in the United
States or its receipt of actual notice of the  initiation or  threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose.

         (e) As promptly as practicable  after becoming aware of such event, the
Company  shall  notify  Investor in writing of the  happening  of any event as a
result of which the prospectus included in a Registration  Statement, as then in
effect,  includes an untrue  statement of a material fact or omission to state a
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading  ("Registration  Default")  and use all diligent  efforts to promptly
prepare a supplement  or amendment to such  Registration  Statement and take any
other  necessary  steps  to  cure  the  Registration  Default,  (which,  if such
Registration  Statement is on Form S-3, may consist of a document to be filed by
the Company with the SEC pursuant to Section  13(a),  13(c),  14 or 15(d) of the
1934  Act  (as  defined  below)  and  to be  incorporated  by  reference  in the
prospectus)  to correct such untrue  statement or omission,  and make  available
copies of such supplement or amendment to each Investor.  The Company shall also
promptly notify  Investor (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus  supplement or
post-effective  amendment has been filed,  and when a Registration  Statement or
any  post-effective  amendment  has become  effective  (the Company will prepare
notification of such effectiveness  which shall be delivered to the Investor via
facsimile on the same day of such effectiveness), additionally, the Company will
promptly provide to the Investor,  a copy of the effectiveness order prepared by
the SEC once it is received by the  Company;  (ii) of any request by the SEC for
amendments or supplements to a Registration  Statement or related  prospectus or
related  information,  (iii) of the Company's  reasonable  determination  that a
post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate,  (iv)
in the event  the  Registration  Statement  is no  longer  effective,  or (v) if
Registration  Statement is stale as a result of the Company's  failure to timely
file its financials or otherwise.  The Company  acknowledges that its failure to
cure the  Registration  Default  within  ten (10)  business  days will cause the
Investor to suffer damages in an amount that will be difficult to ascertain.  In
case  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  is  held  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction  to be excessive in scope or  otherwise  invalid or  unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible,  so that it is
enforceable to the maximum extent possible,  and the validity and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

         (f) The Company shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to prevent
the  issuance  of any stop  order  or other  suspension  of  effectiveness  of a
Registration  Statement,  or the suspension of the  qualification  of any of the
Registrable  Securities  for sale in any  jurisdiction  and, if such an order or
suspension  is issued,  to obtain the  withdrawal of such order or suspension at
the earliest  possible  moment and to notify the Investor who holds  Registrable
Securities  being sold of the issuance of such order and the resolution  thereof
or its receipt of actual notice of the  initiation  or threat of any  proceeding
for such purpose.

         (g) The Company  shall permit the  Investor and one (1) legal  counsel,
designated by the Investor, to review and comment upon a Registration  Statement
and all amendments and supplements  thereto at least two (2) business days prior
to their  filing with the SEC, and not file any document in a form to which such
counsel  reasonably  objects in writing.  The Company may request to shorten the
Investor's  review period and the Investor will, if possible,  attempt to comply
with the  accelerated  review period.  The Company shall not submit to the SEC a
request for  acceleration of the  effectiveness  of a Registration  Statement or
file  with the SEC a  Registration  Statement  or any  amendment  or  supplement
thereto  without  the prior  approval  of such  counsel or the  Investor,  which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (h) At the  request of the  Investor,  the  Company  shall  cause to be
furnished  to  Investor,  on the  date of the  effectiveness  of a  Registration
Statement,  a legal  opinion,  in form and  substance  reasonably  acceptable to
Investor's counsel,  dated as of such date, of counsel  representing the Company
for purposes of such Registration Statement.

         (i) The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any disclosure of
information concerning an Investor provided to the Company unless (i) disclosure
of such  information  is necessary  to comply with  federal or state  securities
laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid or correct a
misstatement  or omission in any  Registration  Statement,  (iii) the release of
such   information   is  ordered

                                       4
<PAGE>

pursuant  to a subpoena  or other  final,  non-appealable  order from a court or
governmental body of competent  jurisdiction,  or (iv) such information has been
made generally  available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of
this Agreement or any other  agreement.  The Company agrees that it shall,  upon
learning that disclosure of such information concerning an Investor is sought in
or by a court or  governmental  body of competent  jurisdiction or through other
means,  give prompt written notice to such Investor and allow such Investor,  at
the Investor's  expense,  to undertake  appropriate action to prevent disclosure
of, or to obtain a protective order for, such information.

         (j) The Company shall use commercially  reasonable  efforts to maintain
designation  and  quotation  of all the  Registrable  Securities  covered by any
Registration  Statement on the Principal Market.  If, despite the Company's best
efforts,  the Company is unsuccessful in satisfying the preceding  sentence,  it
shall  use  commercially   reasonable  efforts  to  cause  all  the  Registrable
Securities  covered  by any  Registration  Statement  to be listed on each other
national  securities  exchange and automated  quotation system, if any, on which
securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if
any, if the listing of such  Registrable  Securities is then permitted under the
rules of such exchange or system. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in
connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section 3(j).

         (k) The Company shall  cooperate  with the Investor to  facilitate  the
prompt  preparation  and delivery of  certificates  (not bearing any restrictive
legend so long as the shares have been sold and the Investor  has complied  with
all applicable securities laws in connection with such sale, including,  without
limitation,  the prospectus delivery requirements)  representing the Registrable
Securities to be offered  pursuant to a  Registration  Statement and enable such
certificates to be in such denominations or amounts,  as the case may be, as the
Investor may reasonably request.

         (l) The Company shall provide a transfer agent for all the  Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement
filed pursuant hereto.

         (m) If  requested  by the  Investor,  the Company  shall (i) as soon as
reasonably  practical  incorporate in a prospectus  supplement or post-effective
amendment such  information  as such Investor  reasonably  determines  should be
included   therein   relating  to  the  sale  and  distribution  of  Registrable
Securities,  including,  without  limitation,  information  with  respect to the
offering of the  Registrable  Securities to be sold in such offering;  (ii) make
all required filings of such prospectus  supplement or post-effective  amendment
as soon as  reasonably  possible  after  being  notified  of the  matters  to be
incorporated  in such prospectus  supplement or  post-effective  amendment;  and
(iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration  Statement if reasonably
requested by such Investor.

         (n) The Company shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to cause the
Registrable  Securities covered by the applicable  Registration  Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other  governmental  agencies or authorities
as  may  be  necessary  to  consummate  the  disposition  of  such   Registrable
Securities.

         (o) The Company shall otherwise use commercially  reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable  rules and  regulations of the SEC in connection with
any registration hereunder.

         (p) Within one (1) business day after the Registration  Statement which
includes  Registrable  Securities is declared  effective by the SEC, the Company
shall deliver to the transfer agent for such Registrable Securities, with copies
to the Investor, confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared
effective by the SEC.

         (q) The Company shall take all other  reasonable  actions  necessary to
expedite and facilitate  disposition  by the Investor of Registrable  Securities
pursuant to a Registration Statement.

Section 4.  OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTOR.

         (a) At least  five (5)  calendar  days  prior to the first  anticipated
filing date of a Registration Statement the Company shall notify the Investor in
writing of the information the Company requires from Investor if Investor elects
to  have  any  of the  Registrable  Securities  included  in  such  Registration
Statement.  It shall be a condition  precedent to the obligations of the Company
to complete  the  registration  pursuant to this  Agreement  with respect to the
Registrable  Securities of the Investor and Investor shall furnish in writing to
the Company such information  regarding itself, the Registrable  Securities held
by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable  Securities held
by it as shall  reasonably  be  required  to  effect  the  registration  of such
Registrable  Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such
registration  as the Company may  reasonably  request.  Investor  covenants  and
agrees  that,  in  connection  with any  sale of  Registrable  Securities  by it
pursuant  to a  Registration  Statement,  it  shall  comply  with  the  "Plan of
Distribution"  section of the current  prospectus  relating to such Registration
Statement.

         (b)  The  Investor,   by  Investor's   acceptance  of  the  Registrable
Securities,  agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the
Company  in  connection  with the  preparation  and  filing of any  Registration
Statement  hereunder,  unless Investor has notified the Company in writing of an
election to exclude all Investor's Registrable Securities from such Registration
Statement.

         (c) The Investor  agrees that,  upon receipt of written notice from the
Company of the  happening of any event of the kind  described in Section 3(f) or
the  first  sentence  of  3(e),  such  Investor  will  immediately   discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration  Statement(s)
covering such Registrable  Securities until Investor's  receipt of the copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(f) or the first
sentence of 3(e).

Section 5.  EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION.


         All expenses,  other than  underwriting  discounts and  commissions and
other than as set forth in the Investment Agreement, incurred in connection with
registrations including comments, filings or qualifications pursuant to Sections
2  and  3,  including,   without  limitation,  all  registration,   listing  and
qualifications fees, printing and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company shall be paid by the Company.

Section 6.  INDEMNIFICATION.

         In the event any Registrable  Securities are included in a Registration
Statement under this Agreement:

         (a) To the fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  the Company  will,  and
hereby does, indemnify,  hold harmless and defend Investor who holds Registrable
Securities,  the directors,  officers,  partners,  employees,  counsel,  agents,
representatives  of, and each Person, if any, who controls,  any Investor within
the meaning of the 1933 Act or the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "1934 Act") (each, an "Indemnified  Person"),  against any losses,  claims,
damages,  liabilities,  judgments, fines, penalties,  charges, costs, attorneys'
fees,  amounts paid in settlement or expenses,  joint or several  (collectively,
"Claims"), incurred in investigating,  preparing or defending any action, claim,
suit, inquiry,  proceeding,  investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by
or before any court or governmental,  administrative or other regulatory agency,
body or the SEC,  whether  pending or threatened,  whether or not an indemnified
party is or may be a party thereto ("Indemnified Damages"), to which any of them
may become subject  insofar as such Claims (or actions or  proceedings,  whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i)
any  untrue  statement  or alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact in a
Registration Statement or any post-effective  amendment thereto or in any filing
made in connection with the  qualification  of the offering under the securities
or other "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in which the Investor has requested
in writing that the Company  register or qualify the Shares

                                       6
<PAGE>

("Blue Sky  Filing"),  or the  omission or alleged  omission to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,
in light of the circumstances  under which the statements therein were made, not
misleading,  (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact  contained  in the final  prospectus  (as amended or  supplemented,  if the
Company files any amendment  thereof or supplement  thereto with the SEC) or the
omission or alleged  omission to state  therein any material  fact  necessary to
make the statements made therein,  in light of the circumstances under which the
statements therein were made, not misleading,  or (iii) any violation or alleged
violation  by the  Company  of the  1933  Act,  the 1934  Act,  any  other  law,
including,  without  limitation,  any  state  securities  law,  or any  rule  or
regulation  thereunder  relating  to  the  offer  or  sale  of  the  Registrable
Securities  pursuant to a  Registration  Statement (the matters in the foregoing
clauses (i) through  (iii) being,  collectively,  "Violations").  Subject to the
restrictions  set forth in Section 6(c) the Company shall reimburse the Investor
and each such controlling person, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are
due and payable,  for any  reasonable  legal fees or other  reasonable  expenses
incurred by them in connection with  investigating  or defending any such Claim.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the  indemnification
agreement contained in this Section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a Claim arising
out of or  based  upon  a  Violation  which  is  due  to  the  inclusion  in the
Registration  Statement  of the  information  furnished  to the  Company  by any
Indemnified  Person  expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the
Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto; (ii)
shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based on (a) a failure of the
Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by
the  Company or (b) the  Indemnified  Person's  use of an  incorrect  prospectus
despite being  promptly  advised in advance by the Company in writing not to use
such incorrect  prospectus;  (iii) any claims based on the manner of sale of the
Registrable  Securities by the Investor or of the Investor's failure to register
as a dealer under applicable  securities laws; (iv) any omission of the Investor
to  notify  the  Company  of any  material  fact  that  should  be stated in the
Registration  Statement or prospectus  relating to the Investor or the manner of
sale; and (v) any amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such  settlement is
effected  without the prior written consent of the Company,  which consent shall
not be  unreasonably  withheld.  Such  indemnity  shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Person  and shall  survive  the  resale  of the  Registrable  Securities  by the
Investor pursuant to the Registration Statement.

         (b) In connection with any Registration  Statement in which Investor is
participating, Investor agrees to severally and jointly indemnify, hold harmless
and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section
6(a),  the Company,  each of its  directors,  each of its officers who signs the
Registration Statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and the Company's  agents  (collectively
and together with an Indemnified  Person, an "Indemnified  Party"),  against any
Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject,  under the
1933  Act,  the 1934 Act or  otherwise,  insofar  as such  Claim or  Indemnified
Damages  arise  out of or are  based  upon any  Violation,  in each  case to the
extent,  and only to the extent,  that such Violation is due to the inclusion in
the Registration  Statement of the written information  furnished to the Company
by  such  Investor  expressly  for  use in  connection  with  such  Registration
Statement;  and, subject to Section 6(c), such Investor will reimburse any legal
or other expenses  reasonably  incurred by them in connection with investigating
or defending any such Claim;  provided,  however,  that the indemnity  agreement
contained in this Section 6(b) and the  agreement  with respect to  contribution
contained  in Section 7 shall not apply to  amounts  paid in  settlement  of any
Claim if such  settlement is effected  without the prior written consent of such
Investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;  provided,  further,
however, that the Investor shall be liable under this Section 6(b) for only that
amount of a Claim or Indemnified  Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to
such Investor as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration  Statement.  Such  indemnity  shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any  investigation  made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party
and shall  survive  the resale of the  Registrable  Securities  by the  Investor
pursuant to the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the  indemnification  agreement contained in this Section 6(b)
with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any
Indemnified Party if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained
in  the  preliminary  prospectus  were  corrected  on  a  timely  basis  in  the
prospectus,  as then amended or  supplemented.  This  indemnification  provision
shall apply  separately to each Investor and  liability  hereunder  shall not be
joint and several.

         (c) Promptly  after  receipt by an  Indemnified  Person or  Indemnified
Party  under  this  Section  6 of notice of the  commencement  of any  action or
proceeding  (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim,
such  Indemnified  Person or  Indemnified  Party  shall,  if a Claim in  respect
thereof is to be made  against  any  indemnifying  party  under this  Section 6,
deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement  thereof,
and the  indemnifying  party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the
extent the indemnifying  party so desires,  jointly with any other  indemnifying
party similarly  noticed,  to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel
mutually  satisfactory to the indemnifying  party and the Indemnified  Person or
the  Indemnified  Party,  as  the  case  may  be;  provided,  however,  that  an
Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying  party, if, in
the  reasonable  opinion  of  counsel  retained  by the  Indemnified  Person  or
Indemnified  Party, the  representation by counsel of the Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Party and the  indemnifying  party  would be  inappropriate  due to
actual or  potential  differing  interests  between such  Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Party and any  other  party  represented  by such  counsel  in such
proceeding.  The  indemnifying  party shall pay for only one (1) separate  legal
counsel for the Indemnified  Persons or the Indemnified  Parties, as applicable,
and such counsel shall be selected by the Investor, if the Investor are entitled
to  indemnification  hereunder,  or the  Company,  if the Company is entitled to
indemnification  hereunder, as applicable.  The Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying  party in connection with any
negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and
shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information  reasonably available to
the  Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person which  relates to such action or
Claim.  The indemnifying  party shall keep the Indemnified  Party or Indemnified
Person  fully  appraised  at all times as to the  status of the  defense  or any
settlement  negotiations  with respect thereto.  No indemnifying  party shall be
liable for any settlement of any action,  claim or proceeding  effected  without
its written consent,  provided,  however,  that the indemnifying party shall not
unreasonably  withhold,  delay or condition its consent.  No indemnifying  party
shall,  without  the consent of the  Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person,
consent  to  entry  of any  judgment  or  enter  into  any  settlement  or other
compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified  Party or Indemnified  Person of a
release from all liability in respect to such Claim.  Following  indemnification
as provided for  hereunder,  the  indemnifying  party shall be surrogated to all
rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified  Person with respect to all third
parties,  firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification
has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the  indemnifying  party
within a  reasonable  time of the  commencement  of any such  action  shall  not
relieve such  indemnifying  party of any liability to the Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Party  under  this  Section  6,  except  to  the  extent  that  the
indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

         (d) The indemnity  agreements  contained herein shall be in addition to
(i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Person against the  indemnifying  party or others,  and (ii) any liabilities the
indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.

Section 7.  CONTRIBUTION.

         To  the  extent  any   indemnification  by  an  indemnifying  party  is
prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying  party agrees to make the maximum
contribution  with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable
under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that:
(i) no contribution shall be made under  circumstances where the maker would not
have been  liable for  indemnification  under the fault  standards  set forth in
Section  6; (ii) no  seller  of  Registrable  Securities  guilty  of  fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be
entitled to contribution  from any seller of Registrable  Securities who was not
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation;  and (iii) contribution by any seller of
Registrable  Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds
received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities.

Section 8.  REPORTS UNDER THE 1934 ACT.

                                       8
<PAGE>

         With a view to making  available  to the  Investor the benefits of Rule
144  promulgated  under the 1933 Act or any other  similar rule or regulation of
the SEC that may at any time  permit  the  Investor  to sell  securities  of the
Company to the public without registration ("Rule 144"), the Company agrees to:

         (a) make and keep  public  information  available,  as those  terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144;

         (b)  file  with  the SEC in a  timely  manner  all  reports  and  other
documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as
the Company  remains  subject to such  requirements  (it being  understood  that
nothing herein shall limit the Company's  obligations  under Section 5(c) of the
Investment  Agreement)  and the filing of such  reports and other  documents  is
required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

         (c)  furnish to the  Investor,  promptly  upon  request,  (i) a written
statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of
Rule 144, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act,  (ii) a copy of the most recent  annual
or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed
by the Company,  and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested
to permit the  Investor  to sell such  securities  pursuant  to Rule 144 without
registration.

Section 9.  NO ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

         The rights under this Agreement shall not be assignable.

Section 10.  AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

         Provisions  of this  Agreement  may be  amended  only with the  written
consent of the Company and Investor.

Section 11.  MISCELLANEOUS.

given under the terms of this  Agreement  that must be in writing will be deemed
to have been delivered (i) upon receipt,  when delivered  personally;  (ii) upon
receipt,  when sent by facsimile  (provided a confirmation  of  transmission  is
mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party);
or (iii)  one (1) day  after  deposit  with a  nationally  recognized  overnight
delivery  service,  in each case properly  addressed to the party to receive the
same. The addresses and facsimile numbers for such communications shall be:

                  Facsimile:  617-960-3772

         Each party shall  provide  five (5)  business  days prior notice to the
other party of any change in address, phone number or facsimile number.

         (b)  Failure of any party to  exercise  any right or remedy  under this
Agreement or otherwise,  or delay by a party in exercising such right or remedy,
shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

         (c) The laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  shall  govern all
issues  arising  from  or  related  to  this  Agreement  without  regard  to the
principles  of conflict of laws.  Each party hereby  irrevocably  submits to the
exclusive  jurisdiction  of the state and federal  courts sitting in the City of
Boston,  County of Suffolk,  for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in
connection  herewith or with any  transaction  contemplated  hereby or discussed
herein,  and hereby  irrevocably  waives,  and agrees not to assert in any suit,
action  or  proceeding,  any  claim  that it is not  personally  subject  to the
jurisdiction of any such court,  that such suit, action or proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper.  Each party hereby  irrevocably waives personal service of process and
consents  to process  being  served in any such suit,  action or  proceeding  by
mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address for such notices to it under
this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process and notice thereof.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to limit in any way any right to serve  process in any manner  permitted by law.
If any  provision of this  Agreement  shall be invalid or  unenforceable  in any
jurisdiction,  such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or the
validity or  enforceability  of any  provision  of this  Agreement  in any other
jurisdiction.

         (c) This  Agreement  shall be governed by and  construed in  accordance
with the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any of
the conflicts of law  principles  which would result in the  application  of the
substantive  law of another  jurisdiction.  The parties agree that venue for any
dispute  arising  under  this  Agreement  will lie  exclusively  in the state or
federal courts located in New York County, New York, and the parties irrevocably
waive any right to raise forum non  conveniens  or any other  argument  that New
York is not the proper  venue.  The  parties  irrevocably  consent  to  personal
jurisdiction  in the state  and  federal  courts  of the state of New York.  The
Company and the Holder consent to process being served in any such suit,  action
or  proceeding  by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address in effect
for  notices  to it under this  Agreement  and agrees  that such  service  shall
constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing in
this Section 11(c) shall affect or limit any right to serve process in any other
manner  permitted  by law.  The  Company  and the Holder  hereby  agree that the
prevailing party in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
the Registrable Securities, this Agreement or the Investment Agreement, shall be
entitled to  reimbursement  for  reasonable  legal fees from the  non-prevailing
party.

         (d) This Agreement and the Transaction  Documents constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. There are no restrictions,  promises, warranties or undertakings, other
than those set forth or referred to herein and therein.

         (e) This Agreement and the  Transaction  Documents  supersede all prior
agreements  and  understandings  among the parties  hereto  with  respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

         (f) The headings in this  Agreement  are for  convenience  of reference
only and  shall not limit or  otherwise  affect  the  meaning  hereof.  Whenever
required by the context of this Agreement, the singular shall include the plural
and masculine shall include the feminine.  This Agreement shall not be construed
as if it had been  prepared  by one of the  parties,  but  rather  as if all the
parties had prepared the same.

         (g)  This   Agreement  may  be  executed  in  two  or  more   identical
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original  but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, once executed by a party,
may be delivered to the other party hereto by facsimile  transmission  of a copy
of this  Agreement  bearing  the  signature  of the  party  so  delivering  this
Agreement.

         (h) Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed,
all such further acts and things,  and shall  execute and deliver all such other
agreements,  certificates,  instruments  and  documents,  as the other party may
reasonably  request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
