<P><B>CHARLOTTE, Michigan, December 20, 2004</B> - Investors interested in Spartan Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAR) can now get a visit from management with a click of a mouse.</P>

<P>The Charlotte, Mich.-based manufacturer of custom motorhome chassis, fire truck chassis and emergency-rescue vehicles said it has teamed with PDB Connect (<U>www.pdbconnect.com</U>) to develop the pilot of its life-like computerized video investor presentation similar to the one the Company uses when meeting analysts and portfolio managers in person. </P>

<P>More than just Spartan's PowerPoint presentation, the enhanced Life-Like Roadshow utilizes video of CEO John Sztykiel and CFO Jim Knapp to better tell the Spartan story and allows users to "click through" the presentation to different sections of the presentation and to outside links to the Web. The presentation is approximately 30 minutes and covers all content of the Company's standard analyst presentation, including Company background, products, markets and financial information.</P>

<P>"We take great pride in getting products and ideas to our markets first, and this philosophy is also reflected in our investor relations programs," said John Sztykiel, chief executive officer of Spartan Motors.
