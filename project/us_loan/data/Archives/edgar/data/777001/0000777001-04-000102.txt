A brief discussion of the firm's business segments follows:

CAPITAL MARKETS
Fourth Quarter
Capital Markets net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 were a record $1.43
billion, up 22.6% from $1.17 billion for the fourth quarter ended November 30,
2003.
o  Institutional Equities net revenues were $295.3 million, up 10.9% from
   $266.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Institutional Equities
   revenues increased on market-share gains in U.S. listed securities and
   greater risk arbitrage activity. In addition, the consolidation in the first
   quarter of 2004 of Bear Wagner Specialists, LLC, our majority owned NYSE
   specialist firm, resulted in net revenues increasing by approximately
   $40 million over the comparable 2003 period. Partially offsetting these
   increases were reduced convertible arbitrage and equity derivatives revenues
   reflecting lower market volatility levels.
o  Fixed income net revenues were $675.2 million, up 4.1% from $648.9 million
   in the comparable prior year period. Mortgage revenues rose reflecting
   market share gains in the agency CMO sector and significantly increased
   origination volume of adjustable rate mortgages. Active customer order flow
   served to increase net revenues from secondary activities. In addition
   interest rate derivatives increased reflecting continued growth in market
   share and customer activity.
o  Investment Banking net revenues were $458.7 million in the fourth quarter
   of 2004, up 83.3% from the $250.3 million in the comparable prior year
   period. Merchant Banking net revenues totaled $199.9 million in the 2004
   fourth quarter including $160 million in realized and unrealized gains from
   merchant banking investments including the initial public offering of New
   York & Company (NYSE:NWY). The fourth quarter of 2003 included a $33.7
   million realized gain from the sale of a merchant banking investment in
   Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE:ARO). Excluding these gains on investments,
   Investment Banking net revenues increased 37.9% over the fourth quarter of
   2003 due to significantly higher advisory, merger and acquisition and
   merchant banking net revenues.

Full Year
Net revenues in Capital Markets, which include Institutional Equities, Fixed
Income and Investment Banking, were a record $5.35 billion for the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2004, an increase of 11.1% over the record $4.82 billion
revenue reported for fiscal 2003.
o  Institutional Equities net revenues for fiscal year 2004 were up 16.2% to
   $1.08 billion from $932.6 million in fiscal 2003. Increased net revenues
   from domestic and international equity sales and trading, stronger risk
   arbitrage results and the consolidation of the specialist business offset
   difficult market conditions in the equity derivatives and convertible
   arbitrage areas.
o  Fixed Income net revenues were $3.09 billion, up 5.8% from the $2.93
   billion recorded in 2003. The Fixed Income Division reported record results
   for the fourth consecutive year, once again highlighting the strength and
   diversity of that franchise. Solid growth in the mortgage-backed
   securities, leveraged finance, foreign exchange and interest rate
   derivative areas drove increased revenues.
o  Investment Banking also reported record net revenues of $1.18 billion for
   2004, up 22.3% from $961.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The record net
   revenue performance was driven by higher advisory, merger and acquisition
   and merchant banking net revenues.

GLOBAL CLEARING SERVICES
Fourth Quarter
Fourth quarter 2004 Global Clearing Services net revenues were $254.4 million,
up 15.6% from $220.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting increased
net interest revenues. Net interest revenue increased due to higher margin debt
and customer short balances and improved net interest margins. Average customer
margin debt balances for the quarter ended November 30, 2004 were $52.0 billion,
up from $42.2 billion in the prior year quarter. Customer short balances
averaged $78.2 billion during the fourth quarter of 2004 up from $70.1 billion
in prior year period.

Full Year
Net revenues in Global Clearing Services were $910.1 million, up 16.1% from
$784.1 million in fiscal 2003. Net interest revenues increased due to higher
levels of customer margin debt, free credit, stock borrow and customer short
balances. Average customer margin debt balances for the year were $48.0 billion,
versus $40.3 billion for the year ended November 30, 2003. Customer short
balances averaged $76.3 billion during the 2004 year up from $64.3 billion in
fiscal 2003.


WEALTH MANAGEMENT
Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Wealth Management, which include Private Client Services and
Asset Management, were $157.2 million for the quarter ended November 30, 2004,
up 8.4% from $145.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.
o  Private Client Service revenues were $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of
   2004, an increase of 4.3% from $105.1 million in the 2003 quarter reflecting
   improved customer activity and increased revenues from fee based products.
o  Asset Management net revenues grew 19.4% to $47.6 million for the fourth
   quarter of 2004 from $39.9 million in the prior year quarter due to
   increased management and performance fees resulting from the growth in assets
   under management.

Full Year
Wealth Management net revenues were $626.3 million for fiscal 2004, up 22.5%
versus $511.3 million in fiscal 2003.
o  Revenues from the Private Client Service area rose 16.5% to $441.2 million
   for the fiscal year from $378.8 million for fiscal 2003. The improvement
   reflects an increase in commissions and net interest, and the growing
   contribution from fee based assets.
o  The Asset Management business reported record net revenues of $185.1
   million for the full fiscal year 2004 up 39.7% from $132.5 million in the
   prior year due to the growth in assets under management, higher management
   and performance fees and a one time gain on the sale of mutual fund assets
   to The Dreyfus Corporation of approximately $21.5 million.
o  Assets under management rose to $34.9 billion as of November 30, 2004 from
   $27.1 billion as of November 30, 2003. The significant increase in assets
   under management is due in part to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of
   2004 of the fixed income assets of TimesSquare Capital Management, Inc.


EXPENSES
Fourth Quarter
o  Compensation as a percentage of net revenues was 43.8% in the fourth
   quarter of 2004 compared with 48.9% for the quarter ended November 30, 2003.
o  Non-compensation expenses were $491.2 million for the quarter ended
   November 30, 2004, up 42.1% from $345.6 million in the 2003 quarter. The
   increase in non-compensation expenses is due to the impact of the
   consolidation of Bear Wagner, higher professional fees and
   litigation-related costs. Non-compensation expenses as a percentage of net
   revenues increased to 26.9% for the 2004 fourth quarter from 22.6% for the
   fourth quarter of 2003. Professional fees increased 66.6% to $65.4 million
   from $39.2 million due to an increase in employment agency fees, consulting
   fees and professional legal fees. Other expenses were $207.7 million for
   the fourth quarter, an increase of 88.9% from $109.9 million in the same
   2003 quarter, due primarily to an increase in the company's litigation
   reserves.
o  As previously disclosed, The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. and/or its
   subsidiaries have received requests for information and subpoenas from a
   number of regulatory and law enforcement agencies in connection with mutual
   fund trading investigations. During the 2004 fourth quarter, the company
   increased its litigation reserves to reflect management's current
   assessment of the appropriate reserve level for previously disclosed
   matters, including the investigations into mutual fund trading. It is
   possible that the ultimate outcome of these matters may differ from the
   company's current assessment. The company and its subsidiaries are
   continuing to cooperate with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies in
   connection with these matters.

Full Year
o  For the twelve-months ended November 30, 2004, compensation as a percentage
   of net revenues was 47.8% as compared with 48.1% for fiscal 2003.
o  Non-compensation expenses for the fiscal year 2004 were $1.54 billion,
   14.6% higher than the $1.34 billion reported in 2003. Non-compensation
   expense as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2004 increased to 22.6%
   from 22.4% in fiscal 2003. Non-compensation expenses increased due to the
   impact of the consolidation of Bear Wagner, higher professional fees and
   increased legal and litigation related costs.

As of November 30, 2004, total capital, including stockholders' equity and
long-term borrowings, was $46.1 billion. Book value as of November 30, 2004 was
$59.13 per share, based on 144.5 million shares outstanding. The company
repurchased approximately 9.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal
2004 pursuant to its share repurchase plan.

Quarterly Common Stock Cash Dividend Declared
The Board of Directors of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. declared a regular
quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share on the outstanding shares of
common stock payable January 28, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 14,
