<P align="left" style="font-size: 14pt; text-indent: 4%"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt"><I>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., December&nbsp;20, 2004 </I>&#151; SM&#038;A (Nasdaq: WINS), the world&#146;s leading
provider of business strategy and proposal development services that enhance clients&#146; ability to

<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt"><B><I>Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2004 Update</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Revenue for the three months ending December&nbsp;31, 2004 is expected to be between $18.0 and
$18.5&nbsp;million with net income of between $2.3 and $2.5&nbsp;million or $0.10 to $0.11 per diluted share.
Revenue for the full year 2004 ending December&nbsp;31, 2004 will be between $68.7 and $69.2&nbsp;million
with net income of between $9.2 and $9.4&nbsp;million or $0.42 to $0.43 per diluted share. The Company

<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt"><B><I>Fiscal Year 2005 Guidance</I></B></FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">The Company&#146;s goal for the full year 2005 is to grow revenue by approximately 15&nbsp;percent to
approximately $80.0&nbsp;million, compared with the estimated revenue for full year 2004 of $68.7 to
$69.2&nbsp;million. The Company expects first quarter 2005 revenue to be approximately $18.0 to $19.0
million with quarterly revenue growing sequentially through the rest of the year. Full year 2005
gross margins are expected to be approximately 44%, selling general and administrative expenses are
expected to be approximately 22% of revenue due to the Company&#146;s investment in its sales and
marketing infrastructure to support revenue growth and customer diversification, and net income is
expected to be approximately 13% of revenue or approximately $0.45 to $0.47 per diluted share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">&#147;We are having a strong finish to 2004,&#148; said Steve Myers, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. &#147;We&#146;ve added several projects in the fourth quarter that are outside of the aerospace and
defense industries. These new projects are the direct result of our investment during the past
year in our sales and marketing infrastructure. We believe that this investment, the planned
introduction of new services in 2005, and the rejuvenation of our core business all combine to
position us well for strong growth next year,&#148; Mr.&nbsp;Myers concluded.
