          L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT OF ROBERT V. LAPENTA
      -- MICHAEL T. STRIANESE TO SUCCEED HIM AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER --

NEW YORK, NY, December 27, 2004 - L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) announced today
that Robert V. LaPenta has decided to retire as L-3's president and chief
financial officer effective April 1, 2005. Mr. LaPenta will also be leaving
L-3's Board of Directors. Upon his departure, Frank C. Lanza, L-3's chairman and
chief executive officer, will assume the responsibilities of president of the
company during an interim period, and Michael T. Strianese will succeed Mr.
LaPenta as chief financial officer.

"Bob was a co-founder of L-3, which would not have been possible without him. He
was instrumental in L-3's growth from a spin-off from Lockheed Martin with $650
million in annualized revenues in 1997 to an S&P 500 company with an estimated
$6.8 billion in revenues in 2004 and a market capitalization of approximately $9
billion," said Frank C. Lanza. "Bob leaves L-3 well positioned, with a
world-class financial organization and a strong balance sheet that will support
L-3's future growth. We wish Bob well in his future endeavors."

Mr. LaPenta added, "I'm proud of the company we've built in L-3 and what I was
able to accomplish both professionally and personally with a great team
supporting me at both the corporate and divisional level. In 1997, our goal was
to build a preeminent defense electronics company. I am pleased to say that we
have achieved this goal and that L-3 is positioned well for future growth."

With 25 years of experience in finance, including 15 years in the defense
industry, Mr. Strianese, 48, joined L-3 at its inception in 1997. He began as
vice president - finance and controller, and was promoted to senior vice
president - finance in March, 2001.

Mr. Lanza added, "Mike has been a longtime protege of Bob's, having worked with
him for nearly 15 years, and is well prepared to build on the strong foundation
Bob has set for the company. For nearly

eight years, he has been a well respected member of L-3's senior management team
who has also been integral to L-3's success and growth. Since joining the
company at its formation, he has worked with each of our operating divisions,
helping them to achieve their financial goals, and has also been an invaluable
member of our mergers and acquisitions team."

The company also reiterated its previous financial guidance for 2004:

     o    2004 sales to grow in excess of 34% to about $6.8 billion, including
          organic sales growth of between 13% and 14%, with the remaining growth
          coming from acquired businesses

     o    2004 diluted earnings per share of approximately $3.33 (excluding the
          $0.03 charge for the retirement of L-3's 8% $200 million Senior
          Subordinated Notes)

     o    Free cash flow generation for 2004 of about $460 million
