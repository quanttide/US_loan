                 Comtech Group Approves Reverse Split of Shares

SHENZHEN, China, December 29, 2004 -- Comtech Group, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board:
COGO.OB), a leading module design solutions provider in China focused on the
mobile handset and telecom equipment industries, announced today that its Board
of Directors has authorized a reverse stock split in the range between
one-for-two shares and one-for-three shares. The exact ratio will be determined
by management shortly before the effective date of the reverse split, which is
expected to occur in the next two to three weeks. The Board's action was taken
as part of the company's ongoing efforts to effect a listing of its common stock
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Specifically, it is believed that the reverse stock
split will enable the company to meet the $5.00 minimum bid price requirement
for initial inclusion on Nasdaq.
