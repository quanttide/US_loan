<b>Item 1.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</b></p>

<p><u><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Transition Agreement with Thomas F. Chapman</font></u></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On August 18, 2004, Equifax Inc.
announced that Thomas F. Chapman, chairman and chief executive officer, informed the Board of Directors of his decision to retire
after a successor is elected and the transition completed.&nbsp; The Board requested that Mr. Chapman remain through 2005 or such
earlier period of time as would be necessary to ensure an orderly transition.&nbsp; On December 20, 2004, Equifax entered into a
transition retirement agreement with Mr. Chapman for this purpose.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Among the terms of the transition
agreement, in 2005 Mr. Chapman will continue to receive in full his base salary
and benefits, including payments due under his Annual
Incentive Plan award (with a minimum award of 100% of his 2005 base salary) and  restricted stock units representing 50% of
the value which would normally be awarded to him as long-term incentive compensation and 50% of such long-term incentive value in a
restricted cash award.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In addition to any other retirement benefits to which Mr. Chapman is entitled under any
Equifax benefit plans, upon his satisfaction of the terms of the transition agreement (i) his stock options, restricted stock units
and restricted cash award will become vested and exercisable; (ii) he will receive credit for four additional years of service
under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (increasing his annual retirement payments from 48% to 60% of final average pay);
(iii) he will be provided office space, telephone and administrative support for his lifetime; and (iv) he will continue to receive
financial planning and tax advisory services through the tax year in which he attains age 70.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><u><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Executive Retention Awards</font></u></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Equifax considers it essential to the best interests of the company and its shareholders
to ensure the continuity of leadership of the company during the search for a successor chief executive officer and transition
period noted above.&nbsp; Accordingly, on December 20, 2004, the Compensation, Human Resources and Management Succession Committee

of the Board of Directors of Equifax approved
the award to certain key management personnel of Equifax, including certain
executive officers, of restricted stock units (RSUs) upon terms and conditions designed to promote
retention of these officers over the next several years.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The RSU awards are intended to be in lieu of the next three annual RSU grants and have
been made under the shareholder-approved 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.&nbsp; The grant value of the awards is equal to approximately
two times the executive&rsquo;s annual base salary and bonus. The RSUs will generally vest in three equal annual installments if
the executive remains employed by Equifax, beginning on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in
the event of the executive&rsquo;s death, disability, termination of employment without cause or resignation of the executive for
good reason, including among other reasons a reduction in the executive officer&rsquo;s responsibilities.&nbsp; If the executive
retires from employment with Equifax prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant of the RSUs, 33-1/3% of such RSUs will
vest in any event, 66-2/3% will vest if the executive was employed by Equifax on the first anniversary of the date of grant and 100%
will vest if the executive was employed by Equifax on the second anniversary of the date of grant, consistent with the normal
vesting provisions that would apply to the next three annual RSU grants upon an
executive&#146;s retirement.&nbsp; Each of the following executive officers of
Equifax received a grant of 42,000 RSUs: Karen H. Gaston, Donald T. Heroman and Kent E. Mast. </font></p>
