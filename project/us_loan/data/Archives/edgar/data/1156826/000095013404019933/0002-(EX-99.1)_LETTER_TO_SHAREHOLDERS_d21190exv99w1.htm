<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To my fellow shareholders,


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As most of you know, in 1995 we made a strategic decision to reposition our company from owning
apartments in commodity markets, those with minimal barriers to entry, to our current core markets,
markets in which it is exceptionally difficult to build new apartment communities. This
transformation is now substantially complete, as 90% of our current portfolio is concentrated in
these core markets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Now that we have such an outstanding portfolio, we are able to focus on making our portfolio even
better each year by selling non-strategic assets at very attractive prices. Due to the unique
quality of our assets and locations, we are not only selling our assets to other apartment
investors, but are also selling to condominium converters who are converting our rental apartments
into for-sale housing. In 2004 alone, we expect to sell approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion of assets and
purchase over $850&nbsp;million of assets. Most of these acquisitions have been accretive because of
the exceptional compelling sales price we are achieving, and should further enhance our long-term
growth rate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As we announced in our December&nbsp;15<SUP>th</SUP> press release, we recently sold $596&nbsp;million of
non-core assets to condominium converters at capitalization rates of less than 4%, which produced
extraordinarily attractive pricing for us. The enclosed check, representing a special dividend of
$1.00 per share, serves as an excellent confirmation of the value creation embedded in our
remaining core portfolio, which we believe will become even more visible in the years ahead.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We thank you for your continued support.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Sincerely,


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">R. Scot Sellers<BR>
Chairman and CEO
