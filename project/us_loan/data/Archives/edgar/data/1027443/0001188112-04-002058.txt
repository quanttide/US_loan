ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

        On December 17, 2004, Macrovision Corporation entered into a lease with
WB Airport Technology, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, for
premises located at 2860 De La Cruz Boulevard, Santa Clara, California. The
lease is for a term of 12 years commencing on February 1, 2005 and expiring on
January 31, 2017 and covers approximately 73,968 rentable square feet. The first
two months of the lease term are rent free. Thereafter, rent will begin at
$59,174.04 per month and increase each year through the ninth lease year, during
which the rent will be $80,984.25 per month. Beginning in the tenth lease year,
the rent will be the greater of the fair market rental value for comparable
properties in the area or $59,174.04 per month. Under the terms of the lease,
Macrovision shall pay all operating expenses. Macrovision has the option to
extend the lease term for one five-year period.

        On December 17, 2004, Macrovision also signed a second amendment to a

that the lease will now expire on January 31, 2017. The lease covers
approximately 86,785 rentable square feet, and the second amendment provides
that the rent for the last five lease years will be the greater of fair market
value or $69,428.00 per month.
