Item 3.02    Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities

On  December  30,  2004 the  Company  closed a $1.5  million  sale of  equity to
GreenShift  Corporation  ("GreenShift").  GreenShift is owned by Kevin Kreisler,
Veridium's  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  In consideration of immediate
payment of $1.25  million  and payment in February  2005 of  $250,000,  Veridium
issued to GreenShift  750,000 shares of the Company's  Series C preferred stock,
1,500,000  shares of the  Company's  common  stock and an option to  purchase an
additional  375,000 shares of the Company's  Series C preferred  stock for $4.00
per share.

The Series C Preferred  Stock  acquired by GreenShift  may not be converted into
common stock for two years in the absence of a change of control or other merger
or  acquisition  event.  Each  share of  Series C  Preferred  Stock  may then be
converted  into  twenty-five   shares  of  common  stock,   subject  to  certain
anti-dilution  and  price-protection  adjustments  that  are  specified  in  the
Certificate  of  Designations  of the  Series  C  Preferred  Stock.  There is no
expiration  date associated  with the conversion  option.  At all times prior to
conversion,  each share of Series C Preferred Stock has voting power  equivalent
to  twenty-five  shares of the Company's  common  stock.  Each share of Series C
Preferred Stock entitles its holder to receive  cumulative  annual cash or stock
dividends on a pro rated basis with holders of the Company's common stock.

GreenShift  also today announced its intention to acquire  additional  shares of
the Company's common stock directly from the public market.

GreenShift  acquired  the funds used to purchase the  Veridium  securities  from
Cornell  Capital  Partners,  LP ("CCP") in exchange for a debenture  convertible
into GreenShift common stock.  GreenShift also pledged its interest in Veridium,
as well as its interest in GreenWorks Corporation, a publicly traded engineering
services company, to secure the debenture.
