as follows:

          "(v) Any Net Prepayment Premiums collected on the Qualified Loans."

     Section 8.  Authority  Regarding Tax Status of Trust Fund.  Section 8.01 of
the Trust Agreement is amended by adding a new subsection (e) as follows:

          "(e) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to grant Farmer
     Mac, FMMSC,  the Trustee or any other person authority to act in any manner
     that would  cause the Trust  Fund not to be  treated as a fixed  investment
     trust for federal income tax purposes."

     Section  9.  Termination  of the  Trust  Fund.  Section  9.01 of the  Trust
Agreement is restated in its entirety as follows:

          "The respective obligations and responsibilities of Farmer Mac and the
     Trustee created hereby shall terminate upon the distribution to all Holders
     of all amounts required to be distributed hereunder upon (i) the repurchase
     by Farmer Mac of all  Qualified  Loans and REO  Property  remaining  in the
     Trust Fund at the  Termination  Price;  (ii) the final  payment of the last
     Qualified  Loan and/or REO Property  remaining in the Trust Fund;  or (iii)
     distribution  by Farmer Mac  pursuant  to the Farmer Mac  Guarantee  on the
     Final  Distribution  Date for the Class of  Certificates  having the latest
     Final  Distribution  Date of an  amount  sufficient  to  reduce  the  Class
     Certificate  Principal  Balance of such Class to zero;  provided,  however,
     that in no event  shall  any  trust  created  hereby  continue  beyond  the
     expiration of 21 years from the death of the survivor of the descendants of
     Joseph P. Kennedy,  the late  ambassador of the United States of America to
     the Court of St. James's, living on the Cut-Off Date.

          The right of Farmer  Mac to  repurchase  all  Qualified  Loans and REO
     Property in the Trust Fund pursuant to clause (i) above shall be subject to
     the aggregate  Scheduled  Principal  Balances of the Qualified  Loans being
     less than the Termination  Percentage of the Scheduled  Principal  Balances
     thereof as of the Cut-Off Date. Any such  repurchase  shall take place on a
     Distribution  Date for any then  outstanding  Class  (regardless of whether
     such Distribution Date constitutes a Distribution Date for all such Classes
     of  Certificates),  and  the  proceeds  of any  such  repurchase  shall  be
     distributed to Holders of the applicable  Classes of  Certificates  on such
     Distribution  Date,  pro rata, in the first  instance in respect of accrued
     interest and then, as a distribution of principal.

          In  connection  with any  such  termination,  Farmer  Mac  shall  make
     available to financial  publications and electronic services notice for the
     benefit  of  Holders  of   Certificates   to  the  effect  that  the  final
     distribution  will be made on the  Distribution  Date therein  specified to
     Certificateholders of record on the applicable Record Date."

     Section 10. Waivers and Supplemental Agreements. Section 10.02 of the Trust
Agreement is amended by deleting the word "or" at the end of subsection  (a); by
substituting "; or" for the period at the end of subsection (b); and by adding a
new subsection (c) immediately after subsection (b) as follows:

          "(c)  without  the  consent  of  all   Certificateholders   alter  the
     classification  of the Trust Fund as a fixed  investment  trust for federal
     income tax purposes."

     Section 11.  Intended  Classification.  A new Section 11.06 is added to the
Trust Agreement as follows:

          "Section 11.06. Intended Classification. It is intended that the Trust
     Fund be classified for federal income tax purposes as an `investment trust'
     classified   as  a  trust   within  the  meaning  of  Treasury   Regulation
     301.7701-4(c)  and,  notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein,  the
     provisions of this Agreement  shall be applied and  interpreted in a manner
     consistent with such intention,  including,  without  limitation,  so as to
     circumscribe any right to exercise  discretion granted to Farmer Mac herein
     as to matters relating to the Qualified Loans."
