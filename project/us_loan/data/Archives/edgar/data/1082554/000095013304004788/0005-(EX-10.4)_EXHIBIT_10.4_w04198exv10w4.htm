<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby amend the
Agreement as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1. <u><B>Compensation Upon Termination Without Cause</B></u>. <u><I>Section&nbsp;8(d</I></u><I>) </I>of the Agreement

lump-sum amount equal to the greater of either: (a)&nbsp;the
amount Executive would have been entitled to receive in Base
Salary for the time remaining in Executive&#146;s then current
term of employment, or (b)&nbsp;an amount equal to two years of
Base Salary. Such payment shall be fully due and payable to
Executive in a lump sum upon Executive&#146;s Date of Termination.
Additionally, in the event of termination contemplated in
