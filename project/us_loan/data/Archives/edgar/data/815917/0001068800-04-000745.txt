ITEM 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS

         REGULATORY ISSUES

         On December 22, 2004, the registrant's principal operating
subsidiary, Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P. ("Edward Jones"), reached final
settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), NASD
and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") related to allegations that Edward
Jones failed to adequately disclose revenue sharing payments that it
received from a group of mutual fund families and 529 savings plans that
Edward Jones recommended to its customers. In addition to the revenue
sharing allegations, the settlements with the NASD and NYSE also address
allegations that Edward Jones violated various rules related to the sale of
mutual funds based on the receipt of brokerage commissions, rules for
communications with the public, just and equitable principles of trade,
principles of good business practice, unlawful sales contests, the
obligation to retain records, and the failure to establish and maintain
appropriate procedures for supervision and control of business activities


involving the late trading of mutual funds and 529 savings plans. The final
settlements were entered into pursuant to an offer of settlement signed by
Edward Jones on December 20, 2004.

         Pursuant to the settlement orders for each of the SEC, NASD and
NYSE, Edward Jones consented, without admitting or denying the underlying
findings, to findings that it willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Section 15B(c)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), Exchange Act Rule 10b-10
and Rule G-15 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB").
Pursuant to its Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent with the NASD,
Edward Jones also consented, without admitting or denying the underlying
allegations or findings, to findings that it willfully violated Section
17(a) and Rule 17a-4 of the Exchange Act, NASD Rules 2110, 2210, 2820(g),
2830(l), 2830(k) 3010 and 3110. Similarly, pursuant to a Stipulation of
Facts and Consent to Penalty with the NYSE, Edward Jones also consented,
without admitting or denying guilt, to findings that it willfully violated
Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-4 of the Exchange Act, NYSE Rules 342, 401, 440
and 476(a)(6).

         Edward Jones was censured pursuant to the final SEC, NASD and NYSE
settlement orders. The SEC settlement order also requires Edward Jones to
cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 15B(c)(1) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-10 thereunder and MSRB Rule G-15. In
settlement of all three regulatory actions, Edward Jones agreed to pay
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $37.5 million and a civil penalty
of $37.5 million, for a total payment of $75 million. The entire $75 million
must be paid into a FAIR FUND established pursuant to Section 308 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for distribution to Edward Jones' customers
pursuant to a Distribution Plan. Edward Jones also consented to various
undertakings related to (1) enhancing disclosure of the firm's mutual fund
and 529 savings plan revenue sharing arrangements to its customers and
investment representatives, (2) devising and implementing policies and
procedures to ensure compliance with the SEC, NASD and NYSE settlement
orders, the federal securities laws and MSRB rules, (3) devising and
implementing policies and procedures with respect to the review of
prospectuses and statements of additional information, and the training of
its investment representatives regarding financial incentive disclosures,
and (4) the retention of an Independent Consultant to conduct a review of
the adequacy of policies and procedures required under the settlement
orders, evaluate Edward Jones' plan for distributing the FAIR FUND,
administer and distribute the monetary sum ordered to be paid, and to
otherwise evaluate Edward Jones' compliance with the settlement orders.

         The obligations of Edward Jones are set forth in the SEC
administrative order, NASD Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent, and
NYSE Stipulation of Facts and Consent to Penalty, which are filed as
Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, each of which are incorporated
herein by reference.


         DEFERRED CONSIDERATION AGREEMENT

         On December 20, 2004, Edward Jones entered into a Deferred
Consideration Agreement (a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.4, and
which is incorporated herein by reference) with the United States Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of Missouri ("Office"). Pursuant to the
Deferred Consideration Agreement Edward Jones has agreed, in addition to the
SEC administrative order, the NASD Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent,
and the NYSE Stipulation of Facts and Consent to Penalty described above
(collectively, the "Order and Agreements"), to offer its customers holding
shares in Preferred Funds (as described in the Deferred Consideration
Agreement) for a period of ninety (90) days, the opportunity to sell such
holdings without the payment of certain fees by selling the customer's
interest in the Preferred Funds, at net asset value, to purchase shares of
mutual funds in another Preferred Fund or any other mutual fund with which
Edward Jones has a selling agreement ("Switch Funds"). For this purpose,
commissions typically paid to Edward Jones and the Switch Funds will be
waived by Edward Jones and the Switch Funds or Edward Jones will pass
through the commissions received by Edward Jones and the Switch Funds back
to the customer. Edward Jones further agreed to allocate responsibility for
the payment of the amount due under the Order and Agreements among the
registrant's partners (except registrant's limited partners), in a manner
satisfactory to the Office, and to reimburse the United States Postal
Service for its investigation costs and expenses in the amount of $200,000
as directed by the Office.

         CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL

         The California Attorney General has filed civil proceedings with
regard to the foregoing matters in the state of California on behalf of
California residents. Edward Jones intends to defend against those charges
vigorously.

         FINANCIAL MATTERS

         In connection with the $75 million payment required under the
settlement with the SEC, NYSE and NASD the registrant will take a charge of
$50 million against its fourth quarter earnings with the remaining $25
million charged against previously established legal reserves. The $50
million charge will reduce net income before allocations to partners for the
quarter and the year by $50 million.

         The $50 million reduction in net income before allocations to
partners will be specially allocated to subordinated limited partners and
general partners. General partners will be allocated approximately $44.3
million of the charge and subordinated limited partners approximately $5.7
million. Limited partners' allocations of net income before allocations to
partners will not be reduced for the $50 million charge against earnings due
to the settlement. Similarly, for tax purposes the taxes payable in respect
of the non-deductible aspects of the settlement will be entirely allocated
among general and subordinated limited partners.

         The $75 million payment due under the settlement is required to
paid by Edward Jones to an escrow agent not unacceptable to the staff of the
SEC within ninety days of the December 22, 2004 settlement date. Edward
Jones is responsible for all costs associated with the escrow


agreement and the FAIR FUND distribution. Edward Jones is not able to
presently estimate or project costs that will be incurred under the escrow
agreement, FAIR FUND distribution or that may result from its customers
exchanging holdings of the Preferred Funds with the Switch Funds. Edward
Jones plans to satisfy payment of the $75 million from existing partnership
working capital or other resources which may include the of the sale of
presently owned investment securities.

<P>The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") against Edward D.

<P align=justify>III.</P>
<P>On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds<A href="#foot1" name=1><SUP>1</SUP></A> that: </P>
<P align=justify>Respondent</P>
<P>1. Edward Jones is a Missouri limited partnership that has been registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act since 1941. It is also a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). Edward Jones' principal offices are located in St. Louis, Missouri. It has more than 8,000 branch offices staffed primarily by one or two registered Investment Representatives ("IRs") that provide retail brokerage services throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Edward Jones is the principal operating subsidiary of the Jones Financial Companies, L.L.L.P. ("Jones Financial"), a Missouri limited partnership whose limited partnership interests are registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Jones Financial holds all of Edward Jones' partnership equity. Jones Financial is comprised of approximately 275 general partners, 5,021 limited partners and 146 subordinated limited partners. </P>
<P align=justify>Overview</P>
<P>2. Edward Jones is one of the largest sellers of brokerage-sold mutual funds in the United States. Half of all of Edward Jones' customers' assets are invested in mutual funds held in brokerage accounts and college savings plans established under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code ("529 plans"). Edward Jones' customers hold onto their investments for a lengthier period of time than customers at other broker-dealers. Edward Jones has selling agreements with approximately 240 mutual fund families which permit its IRs to sell at least 1,930 different mutual funds. </P>
<P>3. Prior to the late 1980s, Edward Jones had internally designated certain of the mutual fund families with which it had selling agreements as "recommended." In the late 1980s, Edward Jones approached certain of those mutual fund families ("Preferred Families") with which it had long-standing relationships and sought to obtain revenue sharing from them. Edward Jones set an internal revenue sharing target of 25% of the advisory fees earned by those mutual fund families on the mutual fund assets purchased or held by Edward Jones' customers, plus in most instances sought an equity interest in their advisers or distributors. </P>
<P align=justify>The Preferred Mutual Fund Family Program</P>
<P>4. By the early 1990s, six mutual fund families had agreed to make revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones. Between 1993 and 1996, Edward Jones removed one of these fund families and added two new fund families to the list of Preferred Families, raising the total number of Preferred Families to seven. </P>
<P>5. Each of these fund families agreed to make revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones in varying amounts up to and in several cases meeting Edward Jones' target of 25% of the advisory fees for assets purchased or held by Edward Jones' customers. These fees were calculated in various ways and by various measures, including: a flat fee determined by the fund family based on the total fund assets held by Edward Jones' customers; 7.5 to 10 basis points of average fund assets held by Edward Jones' customers in a given year; 12.5 basis points on the gross sales of a Preferred Families' mutual funds made by Edward Jones to its customers in a given year; or 25% of the advisory fee attributable to the average assets of certain Preferred Families' mutual funds held by Edward Jones' customers in a given year. One of the Preferred Families also agreed to provide Edward Jones an equity interest of at least 5% in the distributor of its mutual funds if Edward Jones reached a certain threshold of sales of its mutual fun
ds, this was later changed to profit participation. </P>
<P>6. Revenue sharing was a material factor, among others, in the selection of at least two of the Preferred Families. Revenue sharing was also a material factor, among others, with respect to the retention of fund families as Preferred Families. Edward Jones periodically sought to negotiate additional revenue sharing payments from its Preferred Families.</P>
<P>7. Edward Jones' revenue sharing agreements with the Preferred Families are and have been highly profitable to Edward Jones. Between 1999 and the present, the firm has collected tens of millions of dollars in revenue sharing payments from the Preferred Families each year. Most of these payments have been paid directly to Edward Jones from the assets of the advisers or distributors associated with the Preferred Families. However, for a portion of this time period, Edward Jones also accepted millions of dollars in directed brokerage commissions or "step-outs" from three of the Preferred Families for distribution of mutual fund shares. In these instances, the advisers of these Preferred Families instructed the brokerage firm executing portfolio transactions for their mutual funds to "step out" of the transactions and direct a portion of the commissions for the transactions to Edward Jones. These directed brokerage payments ceased in 2003.</P>
<P>8. Edward Jones' distributed 11% to 12% of its net income, which includes net revenue sharing, to its limited partners and 10% to 12% of its net income to its subordinated limited partners each year and the residual is distributed to the general partners. Thus, the majority of any revenue sharing received by Edward Jones, after operating expenses, was distributed to the firm's general partners, some of whom make decisions regarding which mutual fund families become "Preferred Families" and others of whom are Edward Jones IRs who recommend the Preferred Families to their customers. During 2003 alone, the revenue sharing received by Edward Jones was equivalent to 33% of the net income of Edward Jones' parent holding company, Jones Financial. </P>
<P>9. Out of the approximately 240 mutual fund families with which Edward Jones has selling agreements, only the seven Preferred Families make revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones. These payments are in addition to standard sales loads, commissions, Rule 12b-1 fees, expense reimbursements and sub-transfer-agent fees for maintaining customer account information. Edward Jones does not receive any revenue sharing payments from any non-preferred mutual fund families. Historically, 95% to 98% of Edward Jones' sales of mutual fund shares have been sales of the Preferred Families.</P>
<P>10. Edward Jones and its partners have a financial incentive to internally promote the sales of mutual funds from the Preferred Families over other mutual funds that its IRs can sell. Edward Jones promoted to IRs the existence of revenue sharing by the Preferred Families and encouraged IRs on a case-by-case basis to consider revenue sharing in making recommendations to their customers to purchase certain mutual funds.</P>
<P>11. For example, during the relevant time period, Edward Jones' Director of Mutual Fund Marketing described his "greatest contribution to the Firm's bottom line" as "the Department's ability to continue the focus on selling preferred fund families and the subsequent leverage this gives us to negotiate revenue sharing programs with vendors." He also represented to the IRs that Edward Jones directly passes the revenue sharing income along to the "IRs who did the work to get the money in the first place." </P>
<P>12. During the "rollouts" of the two newest Preferred Families, a general partner of the firm also made broadcast presentations to IRs throughout the country further extolling the benefits the IRs receive from the revenue sharing agreements negotiated with these Preferred Families.</P>
<P>13. At least one newsletter distributed by an Edward Jones regional leader conveyed this message by describing how "[r]evenue sharing can contribute large benefits to the firm in terms of profit and bonus." In a January 2000 regional newsletter, a regional leader further promoted the sales of mutual funds from Preferred Families that provide revenue sharing payments over those that do not provide revenue sharing by describing how, over a ten year period, an IR would receive an additional $256,369 in profit from the sales of such mutual funds. During regional and other meetings, another of Edward Jones' regional leaders, who was also a general partner, encouraged IRs in his region to sell the mutual funds of one Preferred Family over the funds of another Preferred Family that paid less revenue sharing. </P>
<P>14. Edward Jones' IRs receive credits for the amount of revenue sharing that Edward Jones receives from the IRs' proportionate sales and customer holdings of funds from the Preferred Families. These credits were not directly paid to IRs, but were applied as a separate line item to the profit and loss statements ("P&amp;Ls") prepared for each IR's office. These P&amp;Ls are distributed monthly to the IRs and track their profitability to the firm. An IR's profitability to the firm determines whether the IR is successful at Edward Jones and is used as a factor in determining whether the IR will be considered for status as a limited partner. In addition, three times per year, Edward Jones' IRs are eligible to receive bonuses based, in part, on their overall profitability which is impacted by their revenue sharing credits. For an IR to receive a bonus in any of Edward Jones' three annual bonus periods, both the firm and the particular IR's office must be profitable during the period. In addition, if an IR has 
worked for Edward Jones for more than 30 months, the IR also needs to make at least $4,000 in profits to become eligible for a bonus. Edward Jones' top-producing IRs have received as much as an additional $5,000 per bonus period as the part of their bonuses based directly on revenue sharing payments attributable to the IRs' sales and customer holdings of funds from the Preferred Families to their retail customers. </P>
<P>15. Edward Jones further offers "diversification contest" trips to its IRs two times each year. During these contests, the IRs can qualify for a trip by earning points based on, among other things, their sales of mutual funds. Once an IR earns a specific number of points, the IR "wins" a trip. Although the IRs generally can earn contest points for selling any mutual funds or other investment product, for a ninety-day period in the fall of 2002, Edward Jones only gave mutual fund contest points for the sale of a subset of mutual funds from the Preferred Families. One or more of the Preferred Families always participate in the sponsorship of the diversification trips and make one short training presentation for the IRs during each trip. Sponsorship of these trips and other meetings provide the Preferred Families with exclusive access to and visibility with the IRs. </P>
<P>16. The Preferred Families receive certain benefits not otherwise available to non-preferred families. First, Edward Jones exclusively promotes the seven Preferred Families on its public website and exclusively provides links to the Preferred Families' websites on Edward Jones' internal computer system accessible only to its IRs. Second, Edward Jones exclusively lists the Preferred Families in sales literature and newsletters provided to its customers. Third, Edward Jones provides its IRs with research on only the seven Preferred Families and maintains a "Preferred Funds List" containing the names of approximately 110 mutual funds within the Preferred Families that Edward Jones' Product Review department recommends for sale to Edward Jones' retail customers. Only funds from the seven Preferred Families are considered for inclusion on this list. The Product Review department does not review any mutual funds from fund families that are not Preferred Families for this "Preferred Funds List." Fourth, Edward J
ones uses only the Preferred Families as examples in its internal training sessions for new IRs and only invites representatives from the Preferred Families to make presentations at these training sessions. Finally, Edward Jones facilitates exclusive direct access for the Preferred Families to its IRs for the dissemination of marketing materials and to answer IRs' questions regarding the funds offered by the Preferred Families.</P>
<P align=justify>Edward Jones Did Not Disclose Its Financial Incentives To Sell Mutual Funds From The Preferred Families</P>
<P>17. The mutual fund section of Edward Jones' public website lists only the seven Preferred Families and provides links to only the Preferred Families' websites. In addition, since approximately 1997, Edward Jones has claimed on its public website that it focuses on the seven Preferred Families because: "With nearly 11,000 mutual funds available, it can be difficult to know which fund(s) to pick. That's why at Edward Jones, we focus on seven preferred mutual fund families that share our same commitment to service, long-term investment objectives, and long-term performance." </P>
<P>18. During the same time period, Edward Jones did not disclose on its website or in any other written document that it prepared, the revenue sharing, directed brokerage payments and other payments received from the Preferred Families for distribution of mutual fund shares as described above. Edward Jones also did not disclose the dimensions of the potential financial conflict created by these payments. </P>
<P>19. Edward Jones and its IRs do not orally disclose to customers the revenue sharing, directed brokerage or other payments received by Edward Jones in connection with the distribution of mutual fund shares or the potential conflict of interest such payments create. </P>
<P>20. Instead, Edward Jones claimed to rely on language contained in the Preferred Families' prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information ("SAIs") to disclose revenue sharing arrangements. At all relevant times, Edward Jones required its IRs to provide customers with a prospectus at the point-of-sale or with the confirmation of sale of any mutual fund; however, the firm did not require its IRs to provide and IRs did not provide customers with copies of SAIs unless a customer specifically requested a copy. </P>
<P>21. Many of the Preferred Families' prospectuses and SAIs fail to disclose adequate information about the source and the amount of the revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones and the dimensions of the resulting potential conflicts of interest. Although the Preferred Families' prospectuses and SAIs contained various disclosures concerning payments to broker-dealers distributing their funds, few of these disclosures adequately described Edward Jones' potential conflict of interest.</P>
<P>22. During the relevant time period, Edward Jones also has not had sufficient procedures in place to ensure that someone with appropriate knowledge, experience and authority reviews the prospectuses and SAIs of the mutual funds offered by the Preferred Families to determine if they adequately disclose revenue sharing and directed brokerage payments made to Edward Jones or the other incentives offered to Edward Jones by the Preferred Families. </P>
<P align=justify>Edward Jones' 529 College Savings Plan Sales And Disclosures</P>
<P>23. Since 2000, Edward Jones has offered and sold 529 college savings plans to its customers. Offers and sales of 529 plans are municipal securities transactions. Prior to September 2004, Edward Jones stated on its public website that "the 529 plans available through Edward Jones" were three plans offered by three of its Preferred Families. Also, prior to September 2004, Edward Jones provided additional detailed information on its public website about only these three 529 plans. Edward Jones did not list or provide information on its website regarding any of the other numerous 529 plans that it could sell.</P>
<P>24. Edward Jones currently has selling agreements with 14 mutual fund companies to sell their 529 plans. However, Edward Jones promotes only the 529 plans of the Preferred Families that offer 529 plans, two of which pay additional revenue sharing to Edward Jones for sales of 529 plans. Edward Jones expressly encourages its IRs to sell only the 529 plans of the Preferred Families. In internal notices to its IRs announcing the availability of 529 plans from non-preferred families, Edward Jones explicitly states: "Edward Jones will continue to promote only our preferred vendors' 529 plans . . . Although we have a selling agreement with [another 529 plan], they are not one of our preferred vendors. However, if one of your clients feel [sic] the advantages of [another 529 plan] are important factors in their decision, you can sell it." In addition, Edward Jones has made it easier for its IRs to sell and service the Preferred Families' 529 plans versus non-preferred 529 plans.</P>
<P>25. At the same time, Edward Jones has failed to disclose on its website or in any other written documents prepared by Edward Jones, including confirmations of 529 plan sales, the material financial incentives to Edward Jones, its partners and its IRs to sell 529 plans from certain of the Preferred Families over other 529 plans that Edward Jones could sell. </P>
<P>26. Based on the conduct described above, Edward Jones willfully violated:</P>
<OL type=a compact>
<LI>Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which provides that it is "unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities . . . by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails, directly or indirectly . . . to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;" <BR>&nbsp;
<LI>Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act, which provides in pertinent part that it is "unlawful for any broker or dealer to effect for or with an account of a customer any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale by such customer of, any security . . . unless such broker or dealer, at or before completion of such transaction, gives or sends to such customer written notification disclosing . . . the source and amount of any other remuneration received or to be received by the broker in connection with the transaction;" and<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, which provides that "[n]o broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security in contravention of any rule of the [Municipal Securities Rulemaking] Board."<BR>&nbsp; </LI></OL>
<P>27. By virtue of its sales of 529 college savings plans, as described above, Edward Jones also contravened the dictates of Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") Rule G-15, which requires a broker or dealer to send or give a written confirmation to its customer, at or before the completion of a municipal securities transaction, that discloses, among other things, either: "(A) the source and amount of any remuneration received or to be received . . . by the broker [or] dealer . . . in connection with the transaction from any person other than the customer, or (B) a statement indicating whether any such remuneration has been or will be received and that the source and amount of such other remuneration will be furnished upon written request of the customer." </P>

Any firm with which the Independent Consultant is affiliated in performance of his or her duties under this Order shall not, without prior written consent of the Commission's Staff, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Edward Jones, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years afte
r the engagement. <BR>&nbsp;
<P>In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered this undertaking: </P>
<LI>Edward Jones shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification from any source including, but not limited to, payment made pursuant to any insurance policy, with regard to any penalty amounts that Edward Jones shall pay pursuant to this Order, regardless of whether such penalty amounts or any part thereof are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used for the benefit of investors. Edward Jones shall not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any federal, state or local tax for any penalty amounts that Edward Jones shall pay pursuant to this Order, regardless of whether such penalty amounts or any part thereof are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used for the benefit of investors.<BR>&nbsp; </LI></OL>
<P align=justify>IV.</P>
<P>In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Edward Jones' Offer.</P>
<P>Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:</P>
<P>A. Edward Jones is censured.</P>
<P>B. Edward Jones shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-10 thereunder and MSRB Rule G-15.</P>
<P>C. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:</P>
<OL type=1 compact>
<LI>Edward Jones shall pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest in the total amount of $37.5 million ("Disgorgement") and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $37.5 million ("Penalties"), for a total payment of $75 million. <BR>&nbsp;
<LI>There shall be, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair Fund established for the funds described in Section C.1. Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Edward Jones agrees that it shall not, after offset or reduction in any Related Investor Action based on Edward Jones' payment of disgorgement in this action, further benefit by offset or reduction of any part of Edward Jones' payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Edward Jones agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the United States Treas
ury or to a Fair Fund, as the Commission directs. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Edward Jones by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>Pursuant to an escrow agreement not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission, Edward Jones shall, within 90 days of the entry of this Order, pay the Disgorgement and Penalties into an escrow account. The escrow agreement shall, among other things: (1) require that all funds in escrow be invested as soon as reasonably possible and to the extent practicable in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to exceed six months; (2) name an escrow agent who shall be appropriately bonded; and (3) provide that escrowed funds be disbursed only pursuant to an order of the Commission. Edward Jones shall be responsible for all costs associated with the escrow agreement and the Fair Fund distribution.<BR>&nbsp; </LI></OL>
<P>D. Edward Jones shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III.28(a) through (q).</P>

                                    NASD
                  LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER AND CONSENT
                               NO. CAF 040115

TO:      Department of Enforcement
         NASD

RE:      Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., Respondent
         Member Firm
         (BD No. 250)

Pursuant to Rule 9216 of NASD Code of Procedure, Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P.
("Edward Jones" or the "Firm") submits this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and
Consent ("AWC") for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged
rule violations described in Part II below. This AWC is submitted on the
condition that, if accepted, NASD will not bring any future actions against
the Respondent alleging violations based on the same factual findings.

Respondent understands that:

1.       Submission of this AWC is voluntary and will not resolve this
         matter unless and until it has been reviewed and accepted by NASD's
         Department of Enforcement and National Adjudicatory Council ("NAC")
         Review Subcommittee or Office of Disciplinary Affairs ("ODA"),
         pursuant to NASD Rule 9216.

2.       If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as
         evidence to prove any of the allegations against Respondent; and

3.       If accepted:

         a.       this AWC will become part of Respondent's permanent
                  disciplinary record and may be considered in any future
                  actions brought by NASD or any other regulator against
                  Respondent;

         b.       this AWC will be made available through NASD's public
                  disclosure program in response to public inquiries about
                  Respondent's disciplinary record;

         c.       NASD may make a public announcement concerning this
                  agreement and the subject matter thereof in accordance
                  with NASD Rule 8310 and IM-8310-2; and

         d.       Respondent may not take any action or make or permit to be
                  made any public statement, including in regulatory filings
                  or otherwise, denying, directly or indirectly, any
                  allegation in this AWC or create the impression


                                Page 1 of 18              In Re Edward Jones


                  that the AWC is without factual basis. Nothing in this
                  provision affects the testimonial obligations or right of
                  Respondent to take legal or factual positions in
                  litigation or other legal proceedings in which NASD is not
                  a party.

Respondent also understands that Respondent's experience in the securities
industry and disciplinary history may be factors that will be considered in
deciding whether to accept this AWC. That experience and history are as
follows:

         EDWARD D. JONES & CO., L.P. Edward Jones is a Missouri limited
         partnership that has been an NASD member firm since 1939. Edward
         Jones has been registered with the Securities and Exchange
         Commission ("SEC") as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the
         Exchange Act since 1941. It also has been a member of the New York
         Stock Exchange ("NYSE") since 1982. Edward Jones' principal offices
         are located in St. Louis, Missouri. It has more than 8,000 branch
         offices staffed primarily by one or more registered Investment
         Representatives ("IRs") that provide retail brokerage services
         throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
         Edward Jones is the principal operating subsidiary of the Jones
         Financial Companies, L.L.L.P. ("Jones Financial"), a Missouri
         limited partnership whose limited partnership interests are
         registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Jones Financial
         holds all of Edward Jones' partnership equity. Jones Financial is
         comprised of approximately 275 general partners, 5,021 limited
         partners, and 146 subordinated limited partners. Edward Jones'
         prior relevant disciplinary history includes the following:

              In September 2004, NASD censured and fined Edward Jones
              $200,000 for violations of NASD Conduct Rules 2110 and 3010
              for using Edward Jones' bonus plan (by giving credits to IRs
              on the profit and loss statements prepared for each IR's
              office) to encourage IRs to recommend mutual fund and variable
              annuity purchases to customers through the use of margin loans
              and failing to establish and maintain a supervisory system to
              deter and prevent unsuitable recommendations as a result of
              the bonus incentives.


                                     I.

                         WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted
under NASD's Code of Procedure:

         A.       To have a Formal Complaint issued specifying the
                  allegations against Respondent;


                                Page 2 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

         B.       To be notified of the Formal Complaint and have the
                  opportunity to answer the allegations in writing;

         C.       To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary
                  hearing before a hearing panel, to have a written record
                  of the hearing made and to have a written decision issued;
                  and

         D.       To appeal any such decision to the NAC and then to the
                  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court
                  of Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim
bias or prejudgment of the General Counsel, the NAC, or any member of the
NAC, in connection with such person's or body's participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of
this AWC, including acceptance or rejection of this AWC.

Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim
that a person violated the ex parte prohibitions of Rule 9143 or the
separation of functions prohibitions of Rule 9144, in connection with such
person's or body's participation in discussions regarding the terms and
conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including its
acceptance or rejection.


                                     II.

                           ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A.   Respondent hereby accepts and consents, without admitting or denying
     the allegations or findings, and solely for the purposes of this
     proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on behalf of NASD, or
     to which NASD is a party, prior to a hearing and without an
     adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of the following
     findings by NASD:

     1.  OVERVIEW

     Edward Jones is one of the largest sellers of brokerage-sold mutual
     funds in the United States. Half of all of Edward Jones' customers'
     assets are invested in mutual funds held in brokerage accounts and
     college savings plans established under Section 529 of the Internal
     Revenue Code ("529 plans"). Edward Jones' customers hold onto their
     investments for a lengthier period of time than customers at other
     broker-dealers. Edward Jones has selling agreements with approximately
     240 mutual fund families which permit its IRs to sell at least 1,930
     different mutual funds.

     Prior to the late 1980s, Edward Jones had internally designated certain
     of the mutual fund families with which it had selling agreements as
     "recommended." In the late 1980s, Edward Jones approached certain of
     those mutual fund families (the "Preferred Families") with which it


                                Page 3 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     had long-standing relationships and sought to obtain revenue sharing
     from them. Edward Jones set an internal revenue sharing target of 25%
     of the advisory fees earned by those mutual fund families on the mutual
     fund assets purchased or held by Edward Jones' customers, plus, in most
     instances, an equity interest in their advisers or distributors.

     2.  THE PREFERRED MUTUAL FUND FAMILY PROGRAM

     By the early 1990s, six mutual fund families had agreed to make revenue
     sharing payments to Edward Jones. Between 1993 and 1996, Edward Jones
     removed one of these fund families and added two new fund families to
     the list of Preferred Families, raising the total number of Preferred
     Families to seven.

     Each of these fund families agreed to make revenue sharing payments to
     Edward Jones in varying amounts up to and in several cases meeting
     Edward Jones' target of 25% of the advisory fees for assets purchased
     or held by Edward Jones' customers. These fees were calculated in
     various ways and by various measures, including: a flat fee determined
     by the fund family based on the total fund assets held by Edward Jones'
     customers; 7.5 to 10 basis points of average fund assets held by Edward
     Jones' customers in a given year; 12.5 basis points on the gross sales
     of a Preferred Families' mutual funds made by Edward Jones to its
     customers in a given year; or 25% of the advisory fee attributable to
     the average assets of certain Preferred Families' mutual funds held by
     Edward Jones' customers in a given year. One of the Preferred Families
     also agreed to provide Edward Jones an equity interest of at least 5%
     in the distributor of its mutual funds if Edward Jones reached a
     certain threshold of sales of its mutual funds; this was later changed
     to profit participation.

     Revenue sharing was a material factor, among others, in the selection
     of at least two of the Preferred Families. Revenue sharing was also a
     material factor, among others, with respect to the retention of fund
     families as Preferred Families. Edward Jones periodically sought to
     renegotiate additional revenue sharing payments from its Preferred
     Families.

     Edward Jones' revenue sharing agreements with the Preferred Families
     are and have been highly profitable to Edward Jones. Between 1999 and
     the present, the Firm has collected tens of millions of dollars in
     revenue sharing payments from the Preferred Families each year. Most of
     these payments have been paid directly to Edward Jones from the assets
     of the advisers or distributors associated with the Preferred Families.
     However, for a portion of this time period, Edward Jones also received
     millions of dollars in directed brokerage commissions or "step-outs"
     from at least three of the Preferred Families for distribution of
     mutual fund shares. In these instances, the advisers of these Preferred
     Families instructed the brokerage firm executing portfolio transactions
     for their mutual funds to "step out" of the transactions and direct a
     portion of the commissions for the transactions to Edward Jones. These
     directed brokerage payments ceased in 2003.


                                Page 4 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     Edward Jones distributed 11% to 13% of its net income, which includes
     revenue sharing, to its limited partners and 10% to 12% of its net
     income to its subordinated limited partners each year and the residual
     is distributed to the general partners. Thus, the majority of any
     revenue sharing received by Edward Jones, after operating expenses, was
     distributed to its general partners, some of whom make decisions
     regarding which mutual fund families become "Preferred Families" and
     others of whom are Edward Jones' top IRs who recommend Preferred
     Families to their customers. During 2003 alone, the revenue sharing
     received by Edward Jones was equivalent to 33% of the net income of
     Edward Jones' parent holding company, Jones Financial.

     Out of the approximately 240 mutual fund families with which Edward
     Jones has selling agreements, only the seven Preferred Families make
     revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones. These payments are in
     addition to standard sales loads, commissions, Rule 12b-1 fees, expense
     reimbursements, and sub-transfer-agent fees for maintaining customer
     account information. Edward Jones does not receive any revenue sharing
     payments from any non-preferred mutual fund families. Historically, 95%
     to 98% of Edward Jones' sales of mutual funds have been sales of the
     Preferred Families.

     Edward Jones and its partners have a financial incentive to internally
     promote the sales of mutual funds from the Preferred Families over
     other mutual funds that its IRs can sell. In addition, Edward Jones
     promoted to IRs the existence of revenue sharing by Preferred Families
     and encouraged IRs on a case-by-case basis to consider revenue sharing
     in making recommendations to their customers to purchase certain mutual
     funds.

     For example, during the relevant time period, Edward Jones' Director of
     Mutual Fund Marketing described his "greatest contribution to the
     Firm's bottom line" as "the Department's ability to continue the focus
     on selling preferred fund families and the subsequent leverage this
     gives us to negotiate revenue sharing programs with vendors." He also
     represented to the IRs that Edward Jones directly passes the revenue
     sharing income along to the "IRs who did the work to get the money in
     the first place."

     During the "rollouts" of the two newest Preferred Families, a general
     partner of the Firm also made broadcast presentations to IRs throughout
     the country further extolling the benefits the IRs receive from the
     revenue sharing agreements negotiated with these Preferred Families.

     At least one newsletter distributed by an Edward Jones regional leader,
     conveyed this message by describing how "[r]evenue sharing can
     contribute large benefits to the firm in terms of profit and bonus." In
     a January 2000 regional newsletter, a regional leader further promoted
     the sales of mutual funds from Preferred Families that provide revenue
     sharing payments over those that do not provide revenue sharing by
     describing how over a ten year period, an IR would receive an
     additional $256,369 in


                                Page 5 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     profit from the sales of such mutual funds. During regional and other
     meetings, another of Edward Jones' regional leaders, who was also a
     general partner, encouraged IRs in his region to sell the mutual funds
     of one Preferred Family over the funds of another Preferred Family that
     paid less revenue sharing.

     Edward Jones' IRs receive credits for the amount of revenue sharing
     that Edward Jones receives from the IRs' proportionate sales and
     customer holdings of funds from the Preferred Families. These credits
     were not directly paid to IRs but were applied as a separate line item
     to the profit and loss statements ("P&Ls") prepared for each IR's
     office. These P&Ls are distributed monthly to the IRs and track their
     profitability to the Firm. An IR's profitability to the Firm determines
     whether the IR is successful at Edward Jones and is used as a factor in
     determining whether the IR will be considered for status as a limited
     partner. In addition, three times per year, Edward Jones' IRs are
     eligible to receive bonuses based, in part, on their overall
     profitability which is impacted by their revenue sharing credits. For
     an IR to receive a bonus in any of Edward Jones' three annual bonus
     periods, both the Firm and the particular IR's office must be
     profitable during the period. In addition, if an IR has worked for
     Edward Jones for more than 30 months, the IR also needs to make at
     least $4,000 in profits to become eligible for a bonus. Edward Jones'
     top-producing IRs have received as much as an additional $5,000 per
     bonus period as the part of their bonuses based on revenue sharing
     payments attributable to the IRs' sales and customer holdings of funds
     from Preferred Families to their retail customers.

     Edward Jones further offers "diversification contest" trips to its IRs
     two times each year. During these contests, the IRs can qualify for a
     trip by earning points based on, among other things, their sales of
     mutual funds. Once an IR earns a specific number of points, the IR
     "wins" a trip. Although the IRs generally can earn contest points for
     selling any mutual funds or other investment product, for a ninety-day
     period in the fall of 2002, Edward Jones only gave mutual fund contest
     points for the sale of a subset of mutual funds from the Preferred
     Families. One or more of the Preferred Families always participate in
     the sponsorship of the diversification trips and make one short
     training presentation for the IRs during each trip. Sponsorship of
     these trips and other meetings provide the Preferred Families with
     exclusive access to and visibility with the IRs.

     The Preferred Families receive certain benefits not otherwise available
     to non-preferred families. First, Edward Jones exclusively promotes the
     seven Preferred Families on its public website and exclusively provides
     links to the Preferred Families' websites on Edward Jones' internal
     computer system accessible only to its IRs. Second, Edward Jones
     exclusively lists the Preferred Families in sales literature and
     newsletters provided to its customers. Third, Edward Jones provides its
     IRs with research on only the seven Preferred Families and maintains a
     "Preferred Funds List" containing the names of approximately 110 mutual
     funds within the Preferred Families that Edward Jones' Product Review
     department recommends for sale to Edward Jones' retail customers. Only
     funds from the seven Preferred Families are considered for inclusion on
     this list. The Product Review department does not review


                                Page 6 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     any mutual funds from fund families that are not Preferred Families for
     this "Preferred Funds List." Fourth, Edward Jones uses only the
     Preferred Families as examples in its internal training sessions for
     new IRs and only invites representatives from the Preferred Families to
     make presentations at these training sessions. Finally, Edward Jones
     facilitates exclusive direct access for the Preferred Families to its
     IRs for the dissemination of marketing materials and to answer IRs'
     questions regarding the funds offered by the Preferred Families.

     3.  EDWARD JONES DID NOT DISCLOSE ITS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO SELL
         MUTUAL FUNDS FROM THE PREFERRED FAMILIES

     The mutual fund section of Edward Jones' public website lists only the
     seven Preferred Families and provides links to only the Preferred
     Families' websites. In addition, since approximately 1997, Edward Jones
     has claimed on its public website that it focuses on the seven
     Preferred Families because: "With nearly 11,000 mutual funds available,
     it can be difficult to know which fund(s) to pick. That's why at Edward
     Jones, we focus on seven preferred mutual fund families that share our
     same commitment to service, long-term investment objectives, and
     long-term performance."

     During the same time period, Edward Jones did not disclose on its
     website or in any other written document that it prepared, the revenue
     sharing, directed brokerage and other payments received from the
     Preferred Families for distribution of mutual fund shares as described
     above. Edward Jones has did not disclose the dimensions of the
     potential financial conflict created by these payments.

     Edward Jones and its IRs do not orally disclose to customers the
     revenue sharing, directed brokerage and other payments received by
     Edward Jones in connection with the distribution of mutual fund shares
     or the potential conflict of interests such payments create.

     Instead, Edward Jones claimed to rely on language contained in the
     Preferred Families' prospectuses and Statements of Additional
     Information ("SAIs") to disclose revenue sharing arrangements. At all
     relevant times, Edward Jones required its IRs to provide customers with
     a prospectus at the point-of-sale or with the confirmation of sale of
     any mutual fund; however, the Firm did not require its IRs to provide
     and IRs did not provide customers with copies of SAIs unless a customer
     specifically requested a copy.

     Many of the Preferred Families' prospectuses and SAIs fail to disclose
     adequate information about the source and the amount of the revenue
     sharing payments to Edward Jones and the dimensions of the resulting
     potential conflicts of interest. Although the Preferred Families'
     prospectuses and SAIs contained various disclosures concerning payments
     to broker-dealers distributing their funds, few of these disclosures
     adequately described Edward Jones' potential conflict of interest


                                Page 7 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     During the relevant time period, Edward Jones also had not had
     sufficient procedures in place to ensure that someone with appropriate
     knowledge, experience, and authority reviewed the prospectuses and SAIs
     of the mutual funds offered by the Preferred Families to determine if
     they adequately disclose revenue sharing and directed brokerage
     payments made to Edward Jones or the other incentives offered to Edward
     Jones by the Preferred Families.

     4.  EDWARD JONES' 529 COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN SALES AND DISCLOSURES

     Since 2000, Edward Jones has offered and sold 529 college savings plans
     to its customers. Offers and sales of 529 plans are municipal
     securities transactions. Prior to September 2004, Edward Jones stated
     on its public website that "the 529 plans available through Edward
     Jones" were three plans offered by three of its Preferred Families.
     Also, prior to September 2004, Edward Jones provided additional
     detailed information on its public website about only these three 529
     plans. Edward Jones did not list or provide information on its website
     regarding any of the other numerous 529 plans that it could sell.

     Edward Jones currently has selling agreements with 14 mutual fund
     companies to sell their 529 plans. However, Edward Jones promotes only
     the 529 plans of the Preferred Families that offer 529 plans, two of
     which pay additional revenue sharing to Edward Jones for sales of 529
     plans. Edward Jones expressly encourages its IRs to sell only the 529
     plans of the Preferred Families. In internal notices to its IRs
     announcing the availability of 529 plans from non-preferred families,
     Edward Jones explicitly states: "Edward Jones will continue to promote
     only our preferred vendors' 529 plans...Although we have a selling
     agreement with [another 529 plan], they are not one of our preferred
     vendors. However, if one of your clients feel [sic] the advantages of
     [another 529 plan] are important factors in their decision, you can
     sell it." In addition, Edward Jones has made it easier for its IRs to
     sell and service the Preferred Families' 529 plans versus non-preferred
     529 plans.

     At the same time, Edward Jones has failed to disclose on its website or
     in any other written documents prepared by Edward Jones, including
     confirmations of 529 plan sales, the material financial incentives to
     Edward Jones, its partners and its IRs to sell 529 plans from certain
     of the Preferred Families over other 529 plans that Edward Jones could
     sell.

     Based on the conduct described above, Edward Jones willfully violated:

         a.       Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act which provides that
                  it is "unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any
                  securities...by the use of any means or instruments of
                  transportation or communication in interstate commerce or
                  by use of the mails, directly or indirectly...to obtain
                  money or property by means of any untrue statement of a
                  material fact or any omission to state a material fact
                  necessary in order to make the statements made, in light
                  of the circumstances under which they were made, not


                                Page 8 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

                  misleading;" and by virtue of violating Section 17(a)(2),
                  Edward Jones violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110.

         b.       Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act, which provides in
                  pertinent part that "it shall be unlawful for any broker
                  or dealer to effect for or with an account of a customer
                  any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale by
                  such customer of, any security...unless such broker or
                  dealer, at or before completion of such transaction, gives
                  or sends to such customer written notification
                  disclosing...the source and amount of any other
                  remuneration received or to be received by the broker in
                  connection with the transaction."

         c.       Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, which provides that
                  "[n]o broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall
                  make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
                  interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to
                  induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any
                  municipal security in contravention of any rule of the
                  [Municipal Securities Rulemaking] Board."

     Edward Jones also violated NASD's Conduct Rule 2210 which, among other
     things, requires communications with the public, including websites and
     written documents provided to customers, to be fair and balanced, and
     not to omit important facts. This conduct also violated NASD Conduct
     Rule 2110.

     By virtue of its sales of 529 college savings plans, as described
     above, Edward Jones also contravened the dictates of Municipal
     Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") Rule G-15, which requires a broker
     or dealer to send or give a written confirmation to its customer, at or
     before the completion of a municipal securities transaction, that
     discloses, among other things, either: "(A) the source and amount of
     any remuneration received or to be received...by the broker [or]
     dealer...in connection with the transaction from any person other than
     the customer, or (B) a statement indicating whether any such
     remuneration has been or will be received and that the source and
     amount of such other remuneration will be furnished upon written
     request of the customer." This conduct also violates Section 15B(c)(1)
     of the Exchange Act which requires broker-dealers to abide by MSRB
     rules with respect to municipal securities transactions.

     5.  IMPROPERLY FAVORING THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS ON THE BASIS OF
         BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS--VIOLATION OF NASD CONDUCT RULES 2830(k) AND
         2110

     In addition to direct payments from the advisers or distributors of
     seven Preferred Families, from January 1999 through December 2003,
     Edward Jones received almost $18 million in directed brokerage from
     three of the Preferred Families. Each of these three Preferred Families
     routed portfolio trades to a clearing firm, and, as part of the trade
     settlement, included a commission payment (typically $.05 - $.06 per
     share) to the clearing firm. The clearing firm, in turn, retained a fee
     for its execution and


                                Page 9 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     clearance services (typically $.01 per share) and credited the
     remainder of the commission payments to Edward Jones, in cash or as a
     credit due to the clearing firm for other Edward Jones business. These
     "step-out" arrangements were a part of Edward Jones' overall revenue
     sharing program through which Edward Jones favored the sale of
     Preferred Family mutual funds to its customers by, among other things,
     including funds from these fund families on its preferred fund list.

     Rule 2830(k) provides, in pertinent part:

         (1) No member shall, directly or indirectly, favor or disfavor the
         sale or distribution of shares of any particular investment company
         or group of investment companies on the basis of brokerage
         commissions received or expected by such member from any source,
         including such investment company, or any covered account.

                                    * * *
         (3) No member shall...request or arrange for the direction to any
         member of a specific amount or percentage of brokerage commissions
         conditioned upon that member's sale or promise of sales of shares
         of an investment company.

                                    * * *
         (6) No member shall,...(A) provide to salesmen, branch managers or
         other sales personnel any incentive or additional compensation for
         the sale of shares of specific investment companies based on the
         amount of brokerage commissions received or expected from any
         source;...(B) recommend specific investment companies to sales
         personnel, or establish "recommended," "selected," or "preferred"
         lists of investment companies..., if such companies are recommended
         or selected on the basis of brokerage commissions received or
         expected from any source; [or] (C) grant to salesmen, branch
         managers or other sales personnel any participation in brokerage
         commissions received by such member from portfolio transactions of
         an investment company whose shares are sold by such member,...if
         such commissions are directed by, or identified with, such
         investment company.(2)

     By virtue of the brokerage commission arrangements described above,
     Edward Jones violated NASD Conduct Rules 2830(k) and 2110.

     6.  UNLAWFUL SALES CONTEST--VIOLATION OF NASD CONDUCT RULES 2830(L),
         2820(G), AND 2110

     Edward Jones holds a sales contest every six months awarding a
     diversification contest trip ("DivTrip") to IRs who successfully meet
     various sales goals. Winners choose from a list of up to 35 highly
     desirable "world-class" vacation destinations, such as Singapore, St.
     Martin, Davos, Biarritz, and Tortola. Edward Jones provides airfare,
     5-star accommodations, and treats attendees to various activities such
     as skiing, golfing, fine dining, and tours. For one trip, billed as a
     "shopping spree," Edward Jones provided each IR with a $1,000 shopping
     allowance. Annually, over 3,500 IRs (accompanied by spouses) take such
     trips. The average value of each trip is approximately $5000.

     For the DivTrip contest beginning in October 2002, Edward Jones revised
     the contest rules so that only commissions on a subset of Edward Jones'
     preferred funds and certain variable annuities (the "Preferred Funds
     List") counted towards winning a DivTrip. Sales of other mutual funds
     and variable annuities, including certain funds in the Preferred
     Families that were not listed on the Preferred Fund list, did not earn
     sales credits needed to win a DivTrip. Indeed, Edward Jones changed the
     contest rules specifically to incent IRs to sell only the funds on the
     Preferred Funds List and Edward Jones expected the preferred
     wholesalers to promote only the listed funds and variable annuities
     when dealing with Edward Jones' IRs. Further, some IRs complained that
     "doing the right thing for the client" (by recommending non-preferred
     funds and variable annuities) penalized their chance to earn a DivTrip.
     Approximately halfway through the contest period, Edward Jones reverted
     to the prior contest rules, thereafter allowing IRs to earn sales
     credits for all mutual fund and variable annuities sales, not just
     preferred fund and variable annuity sales. However, when Edward Jones
     awarded DivTrips for the October 2002 contest, the Firm unlawfully
     credited specific product sales during the first half of the contest
     period.

     NASD Conduct Rules 2830(l) and 2820(g) govern non-cash compensation
     received by a member's associated persons in connection with sales
     contests. Rules 2830 (Investment Company Securities) and 2820 (Variable
     Contracts of an Insurance Company) require member firms to base sales
     contest awards on the total production of a registered representative
     with respect to all mutual funds and variable contracts distributed by
     the firm. Further, each rule requires that contest credit for each sale
     is equally weighted. These rules were established to avoid creating
     significant conflicts of interest that might compromise the requirement
     to meet the investment needs of the customer with the most appropriate
     investment product.

     Edward Jones, by excluding mutual funds and variable annuities that
     were not on the Preferred Funds List, created a product specific
     contest in which sales were not equally weighed for at least the first
     half of the contest period beginning in October


                               Page 11 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     2002, in violation of NASD Conduct Rules 2830(l) and 2820(g). This
     conduct also violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110.

     7.  FAILURE TO PRESERVE E-MAILS AND FAILURE TO RETAIN E-MAILS IN A
         READILY ACCESSIBLE PLACE FOR TWO YEARS--VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 17(a)
         OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 17a-4 THEREUNDER AND NASD CONDUCT
         RULES 3110 AND 2110

     Edward Jones uses a number of electronic systems to communicate among
     and between its associated persons. These include "home office" e-mails
     (communications used within the home office, that is, by headquarters
     personnel located principally in St. Louis), "wires" (communications
     via the Firm's proprietary in-house computer system between IRs and
     Edward Jones' home office personnel), and Internet e-mails for
     registered representatives.

     Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires broker dealers to "make
     and keep for proscribed periods" certain records, and SEC Rule
     17a-4(b)(4) thereunder requires broker dealers to "preserve for a
     period of not less than three years, the final two years in an
     accessible place....[o]riginals of all communications received and
     copies of all communications sent...relating to [the broker dealer's]
     business as such." Further, NASD Rule 3110 requires members to comply
     with SEC Rule 17a-4.

     Despite the requirements to maintain copies of e-mails (and keep such
     copies readily accessible for two years), Edward Jones failed to
     preserve home office and wire e-mails for an eight-month period and
     failed to preserve internet e-mails for one year. Further, Edward Jones
     failed to retain home office e-mails sent and received during a
     nine-month period in a readily accessible place.

     These failures by Edward Jones constitute violations of Section 17(a)
     of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4 thereunder and NASD Conduct Rule
     3110. Such failures are inconsistent with just and equitable principals
     of trade, and therefore, also violate NASD Conduct Rule 2110.

     8.  EDWARD JONES FAILED TO SUPERVISE LATE TRADING--VIOLATIONS OF NASD
         CONDUCT RULES 3010 AND 2110

     Under the provisions of federal securities laws, mutual fund
     transactions received after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time ("EST") are
     to be given the next day's net asset value (NAV). Under a practice
     commonly known as late trading, a trader may seek to profit from market
     events that occur after 4:00 p.m. but that are not reflected in that
     day's price, by waiting until after 4:00 p.m. to place a trade order,
     but arranging to receive that day's NAV.

     Prior to November 2003, the Firm permitted IRs to enter mutual fund
     trades after 4:00 p.m. EST and still receive the same day's NAV. As a
     standard operating practice, trades entered in the Edward Jones'
     computer system after 4:00 p.m. EST were automatically assigned the
     next day's NAV. Under certain circumstances described below, however,
     the Firm allowed mutual fund transactions entered after 4:00 p.m. EST
     to be allocated the same day's NAV. These transactions were referred to
     as "released trades."


                               Page 12 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     Prior to November 30, 2003, between 4:01 p.m. EST and 4:45 p.m. EST,
     the Firm allowed IRs to call the Service Division at Edward Jones
     Headquarters and request that a trade entered after the 4:00 p.m. EST
     be "released" and allocated the same day's NAV. In order to "release"
     the trade, a Service Division representative was required to secure the
     IR's certification that the trade order had been received prior to 4:00
     p.m. EST.

     The Firm had between approximately 75 and 100 service specialists, and
     members of an internal support group, who had the ability to approve
     released trades. Between May 2003 and November 2003, the Firm
     identified approximately 8,700 instances where an order was entered,
     changed or cancelled after 4:00 P.M. and the execution price was based
     on the same day's NAV. Typically, the only question posed to the IR by
     the service representative was whether the IR received the order prior
     to 4:00 p.m. EST. Once the IR answered the question in the affirmative,
     the trade was released and allocated that day's NAV.

     Beyond released trades, the Firm also permitted trade corrections. If a
     transaction entered by an IR into the Firm's computer system prior to
     4:00 pm EST had administrative errors, an IR was allowed to correct
     after the fact, among other things, the quantity and fund name of the
     mutual fund trade without any prior supervisory approval. Such trade
     corrections, however, were listed on reports provided to the IR's field
     supervision director (compliance supervisor).

     Edward Jones did not have adequate policies and procedures in place to
     approve released trades or to determine whether trades were
     legitimately allocated the same day's NAV until November 2003.

     The Firm failed to provide the service representatives with written
     policies and/or procedures delineating the criteria for approving
     released trades. Moreover, the Firm had no mechanism to document either
     requests made or approvals granted for the purpose of releasing late
     trades. Edward Jones also did not have polices and/or procedures for
     supervisory review of decisions to grant requests for released trades.

     The Firm's failure to adopt specific procedures in order to supervise
     this process properly, resulted in the Firm's inability to prevent and
     detect any abuse of this system by IRs and any unlawful late trading
     that may have existed. By this failure, Edward Jones violated NASD
     Conduct Rules 3010 and 2110.

     9.  EDWARD JONES FAILED TO SUPERVISE OR TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN, AND
         ENFORCE ADEQUATE WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS RELATED
         TO SALES OF PREFERRED FAMILY MUTUAL FUNDS AND 529 PLANS--VIOLATIONS
         OF NASD CONDUCT RULES 3010 AND 2110

     NASD Conduct Rule 3010 requires each member to assign responsibility
     for each type of business that the member conducts to an appropriately
     registered principal. Assigned supervisors are required to reasonably
     supervise activities under their purview. Rule 3010 also requires each
     member to establish both supervisory systems and written supervisory
     procedures specifically tailored to the member's business that address
     the activities of its registered and associated persons.


                               Page 13 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

     As described herein, Edward Jones did not reasonably supervise
     activities related to, inter alia, the sale of Preferred Family mutual
     funds and 529 plans, revenue sharing, directed brokerage, sales
     contests, the preservation and retention of e-mails, and late trading.
     Further, Edward Jones did not establish reasonable supervisory systems
     and procedures tailored to these activities. These failures constituted
     violations of NASD Rules 3010 and 2110.

B.       Sanctions

Simultaneously with this proceeding, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange
have instituted proceedings against Edward Jones. Edward Jones has agreed to
pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $37.5 million ("Disgorgement")

         fund families.

         b. Edward Jones shall place and maintain on the college savings
         program portion of its public website within 15 days of the date of

         source of such payments (fund assets, adviser, distributor,

                               Page 14 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

         c. Edward Jones shall send the information contained in paragraphs

         (iii) in those cases where confirmations are sent out directly by
         Edward Jones, to all customers at or before the completion of each
         transaction in mutual funds and 529 plans, except that Edward Jones
         may send the information quarterly to customers purchasing mutual
         funds pursuant to a periodic plan in compliance with Exchange Act
         Rule 10b-10 and to customers purchasing 529 plans pursuant to a
         periodic municipal fund security plan in compliance with MSRB Rule
         G-15.

         d. Edward Jones shall devise and implement within 60 days of the
         date of Notice of Acceptance of this AWC a policy and set of
         procedures to ensure that Edward Jones is complying with its
         disclosure obligations under this AWC, the federal securities laws
         and the MSRB rules. The policy and procedures shall also ensure
         that all statements made on Edward Jones' public website comply

         are otherwise not misleading.

         e. Edward Jones shall devise and implement within 60 days of Notice

         families from its list of Preferred Families.

         g. Edward Jones shall devise and implement within 60 days of Notice

         h. Edward Jones shall retain, within 60 days of the date of Notice
         of Acceptance of this AWC, the services of an Independent
         Consultant not unacceptable to NASD Staff. Edward Jones shall
         exclusively bear all costs, including compensation and expenses,
         associated with the retention of the Independent Consultant. Edward
         Jones shall retain the Independent Consultant to conduct a
         comprehensive review of: (i) the adequacy of the policies and
         procedures that Edward Jones is required to devise and implement
         under this AWC; and (ii) whether Edward Jones' receipt and
         disclosure of revenue sharing


                               Page 15 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

         payments is in compliance with this AWC, the federal securities
         laws and the MSRB rules.

         i. Edward Jones shall further retain the Independent Consultant to,
         at the conclusion of the review, which in no event shall be more
         than 120 days after Notice of Acceptance of this AWC, submit to
         Edward Jones and to NASD Staff an Initial Report. The Initial
         Report shall address, at a minimum: (i) the adequacy of the
         policies and procedures that Edward Jones is required to devise and
         implement under this AWC; and (ii) whether Edward Jones' receipt
         and disclosure of revenue sharing payments is in compliance with
         this AWC, the federal securities laws and the MSRB rules. The
         Initial Report must include a description of the review performed,
         the conclusions reached, and the Independent Consultant's
         recommendations for modifications and additions to the policies and
         procedures devised and implemented by Edward Jones.

         j. Within 150 days from Notice of Acceptance of this AWC, Edward
         Jones shall in writing advise the Independent Consultant and the
         NASD Staff of the recommendations from the initial report that it
         is adopting and the recommendations that it considers to be
         unnecessary or inappropriate. With respect to any recommendation
         that Edward Jones considers unnecessary or inappropriate, Edward
         Jones shall explain why the objective or purpose of such
         recommendation is unnecessary or inappropriate and provide in
         writing an alternative policy, procedure, or system designed to
         achieve the same objective or purpose.

         k. With respect to any recommendation with which Edward Jones and
         the Independent Consultant do not agree, Edward Jones shall attempt
         in good faith to reach an agreement with the Independent Consultant
         within 180 days from the date of the entry of the Order. In the
         event that the Independent Consultant and Edward Jones are unable
         to agree on an alternative proposal, Edward Jones and the
         Independent Consultant shall jointly confer with NASD Staff to
         resolve the matter.

         l. Edward Jones shall further retain the Independent Consultant to
         conduct a follow up review and submit a written Final Report to
         Edward Jones and to NASD Staff no later than one year after Notice
         of Acceptance of this AWC. In the Final Report, the Independent
         Consultant shall address Edward Jones' compliance with this AWC,
         its implementation of the policies and procedures adopted under
         this AWC and make any further recommendations he or she deems
         necessary. Within 30 days of its receipt of the Independent
         Consultant's Final Report, Edward Jones shall adopt the
         recommendations contained in the Final Report.

         m. Within 60 days of the date of the Notice of Acceptance of this
         AWC, Edward Jones shall submit to the Independent Consultant for
         review (and simultaneously to the NASD staff) a plan ("Distribution
         Plan") pursuant to which the Independent Consultant shall
         administer and distribute the monetary sums ordered to be


                               Page 16 of 18              In Re Edward Jones

         paid pursuant to Section IV.C of the SEC Order. The Distribution
         Plan shall address how such monetary sums shall be distributed to
         benefit customers who purchased through Edward Jones mutual funds
         of the Preferred Families between January 1, 1999 and the date of
         the entry of this Order. The Distribution Plan shall not be
         unacceptable to the Independent Consultant. If the Independent
         Consultant finds that the Distribution Plan is unacceptable, Edward
         Jones shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with the
         Independent Consultant within 90 days of the entry of this Order.
         In the event that Edward Jones and the Independent Consultant are
         unable to agree on an alternative proposal, Edward Jones shall
         abide by the recommendation of the Independent Consultant. The
         final Distribution Plan shall be submitted, and must be acceptable,
         to the NASD Staff.

         n. Edward Jones shall cooperate fully with the Independent
         Consultant and shall provide the Independent Consultant with access
         to Edward Jones' files, books, records and personnel as reasonably
         requested by the Independent Consultant.

         o. For good cause shown, and upon receipt of a timely application
         from the Independent Consultant or Edward Jones, NASD staff may
         extend any of the procedural dates set forth above.

         p. To ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant, Edward
         Jones: (i) shall not have the authority to terminate the
         Independent Consultant, without the prior written approval of NASD
         Staff; (ii) shall compensate the Independent Consultant, and
         persons engaged to assist the Independent Consultant, for services
         rendered pursuant to this AWC at their reasonable and customary
         rates; (iii) shall not be in and shall not have an attorney-client
         relationship with the Independent Consultant and shall not seek to
         invoke the attorney-client privilege or any other doctrine or
         privilege to prevent the Independent Consultant from transmitting
         any information, reports, or documents to NASD staff.

         q. To further ensure the independence of the Independent
         Consultant, Edward Jones shall require the Independent Consultant
         to enter into an agreement that provides that for the period of the
         engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the
         engagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into any
         employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other
         professional relationship with Edward Jones, or any of its present
         or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents
         acting in their capacity. Any firm with which the Independent
         Consultant is affiliated in performance of his or her duties under
         this AWC shall not, without prior written consent of NASD Staff,
         enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or
         other professional relationship with Edward Jones, or any of its
         present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or
         agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the
         engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement.

          or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails,
          directly or indirectly obtained money or property by means of
          untrue statements of material fact or omissions to state material

    findings of fact to which the Parties consented without the presentation of
    evidence or testimony. The findings herein are made pursuant to the Firm's
    offer of settlement and are not binding on any other person or entity in
    this or any other proceeding.



                                     3


          A.   The Firm encouraged investment representatives to sell mutual

          C.   The Firm failed to send or give written confirmations to

               connection with the transaction from persons other than the
               customers, or a statement indicating whether it received or
               will receive any such remuneration and that the source and
               amount of such other remuneration will be furnished upon

          B.   Reasonably supervise its business activities, and to
               establish and maintain appropriate procedures for supervision

                        BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTION
                        ---------------------------

     1.   Edward Jones is a registered broker dealer and has been a member
          firm since November 17, 1982 with principal offices located in St.
          Louis, Missouri. Edward Jones has more than 8,000 branch offices
          staffed primarily by one or two registered Investment
          Representatives ("IRs") that provide retail brokerage services
          throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The
          Firm is the principal operating subsidiary of the Edward Jones
          Financial Companies, L.L.L.P. ("Jones Financial"), a Missouri
          limited partnership whose limited partnership interests are
          registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Jones
          Financial holds all of Edward Jones' partnership equity. Jones
          Financial is comprised of approximately 275 general partners,
          5,021 limited partners and 146 subordinated limited partners.

     2.   On or about January 9, 2004, the Exchange notified the Firm in
          writing that the Exchange's Division of Enforcement had opened a
          formal investigation of the Firm in connection with its receipt of
          revenue sharing and sales incentives provided to brokers for the
          promotion and sale of certain mutual funds and late trading of
          mutual funds.

                                  OVERVIEW
                                  --------

     3.   Edward Jones is one of the largest sellers of brokerage-sold
          mutual funds in the United States. Half of all of Edward Jones'
          customers' assets are invested in mutual funds held in brokerage
          accounts and college savings plans established under Section 529
          of the Internal Revenue Code ("529 plans"). Edward Jones'
          customers hold onto their investments for a lengthier period of
          time than customers at other brokerdealers. Edward Jones has
          selling agreements with approximately 240 mutual fund families
          which permit its IRs to sell at least 1,930 different mutual
          funds.

     4.   Prior to the late 1980's, Edward Jones had internally designated
          certain of the mutual fund families with which it had selling
          agreements as "recommended." In the late 1980s, Edward Jones
          approached certain of those mutual fund families ("Preferred
          Families") with which it had long-standing relationships and
          sought to obtain revenue sharing from them. Edward Jones set an
          internal revenue sharing target of 25% of the advisory fees earned
          by those mutual fund families on the mutual fund assets purchased
          or held by Edward Jones' customers, plus in most instances, sought
          an equity interest in their advisers or distributors.

     5.   In addition, the Firm had other supervisory failures in that it
          allowed mutual fund transactions entered after 4:00 p.m. Eastern
          Standard Time to receive the same days net asset value and failed
          to preserve home office and wire e-mails for an eight-month period
          and failed to preserve Internet e-mails for one year.

                  THE PREFERRED MUTUAL FUND FAMILY PROGRAM
                  ----------------------------------------

     6.   By the early 1990s, six mutual fund families had agreed to make
          revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones. Between 1993 and 1996,
          Edward Jones removed one of these fund families and added two new
          fund families to the list of Preferred Families, raising the total
          number of Preferred Families to seven.

     7.   Each of these fund families agreed to make revenue sharing
          payments to Edward Jones in varying amounts up to and in several
          cases meeting Edward Jones' target of 25% of the advisory fees for
          assets purchased or held by Edward Jones' customers. These fees
          were calculated in various ways and by various measures,
          including: a flat fee determined by the fund family based on the
          total fund assets held by Edward Jones customers; 7.5 to 10 basis
          points of average fund assets held by Edward Jones' customers in a
          given year; 12.5 basis points on the gross sales of a Preferred
          Families' mutual funds made by Edward Jones to its customers in a
          given year; or 25% of the advisory fee attributable to the average
          assets of certain Preferred Families' mutual funds held by Edward
          Jones' customers in a given year. One of the Preferred Families
          also agreed to provide Edward Jones an equity interest of at least
          5% in the distributor of its mutual funds if Edward Jones reached
          a certain threshold of sales of its mutual funds; this was later
          changed to profit participation.

     8.   Revenue sharing was a material factor, among others, in the
          selection of at least two of the Preferred Families. Revenue
          sharing was also a material factor, among others, with respect to
          the retention of fund families as Preferred Families. Edward Jones
          periodically sought to negotiate additional revenue sharing
          payments from its Preferred Families.

     9.   Edward Jones' revenue sharing agreements with the Preferred
          Families are and have been highly profitable to Edward Jones.
          Between 1999 and the present, the Firm has collected tens of
          millions of dollars in revenue sharing payments from the Preferred
          Families each year. Most of these payments have been paid directly
          to Edward Jones from the assets of the advisers or distributors
          associated with the Preferred Families. However, for a portion of
          this time period, Edward Jones also received millions of dollars
          in directed brokerage commissions or "step-outs" from three of the
          Preferred Families for distribution of mutual fund shares. In
          these instances, the advisers of these Preferred Families
          instructed the brokerage firm executing portfolio transactions for
          their mutual funds to "step out" of the transactions and direct a
          portion of the commissions for the transactions to Edward Jones.
          These directed brokerage payments ceased in 2003.

     10.  Edward Jones distributed 11% to 12% of its net income, which
          includes net revenue sharing, to its limited partners and 10% to
          12% of its net income to its subordinated limited partners each
          year and the residual is distributed to the general partners.
          Thus, the majority of any revenue sharing received by Edward
          Jones, after operating expenses, was distributed to the Firm's
          general partners some of whom make




<PAGE>
                                     6


          decisions regarding which mutual fund families become "Preferred
          Families" and others of whom are Edward Jones IRs who recommend
          Preferred Families to their customers. During 2003 alone, the
          revenue sharing received by Edward Jones was equivalent to 33% of
          the net income of Edward Jones parent holding company, Jones
          Financial.

     11.  Out of the approximately 240 mutual fund families with which
          Edward Jones has selling agreements, only the seven Preferred
          Families make revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones. These
          payments are in addition to standard sales loads, commissions,
          Rule 12b-1 fees, expense reimbursements and sub-transfer-agent
          fees for maintaining customer account information. Edward Jones
          does not receive any revenue sharing payments from any
          non-preferred mutual fund families. Historically 95% to 98% of
          Edward Jones sales of mutual fund shares have been sales of the
          Preferred Families.

     12.  Edward Jones and its partners have a financial incentive to
          internally promote the sales of mutual funds from the Preferred
          Families over other mutual funds that its IRs can sell. Edward
          Jones promoted to IRs the existence of revenue sharing by
          Preferred Families and encouraged IRs on a case-by-case basis to
          consider revenue sharing in making recommendations to their
          customers to purchase certain mutual funds.

     13.  For example, during the relevant time period, Edward Jones'
          Director of Mutual Fund Marketing described his "greatest
          contribution to the Firm's bottom line" as "the Department's
          ability to continue the focus on selling preferred fund families
          and the subsequent leverage this gives us to negotiate revenue
          sharing programs with vendors." He also represented to the IRs
          that Edward Jones directly passes the revenue sharing income along
          to the "IRs who did the work to get the money in the first place."

     14.  During the "rollouts" of the two newest Preferred Families, a
          general partner of the Firm also made broadcast presentations to
          IRs throughout the country further extolling the benefits the IRs
          receive from the revenue sharing agreements negotiated with these
          Preferred Families.

     15.  At least one newsletter distributed by an Edward Jones' regional
          leader conveyed this message by describing how "[r]evenue sharing
          can contribute large benefits to the Firm in terms of profit and
          bonus." In a January 2000 regional newsletter, a regional leader
          further promoted the sales of mutual funds from Preferred Families
          that provide revenue sharing payments over those that do not
          provide revenue sharing by describing how over a ten year period,
          an IR would receive an additional $256,369 in profit from the
          sales of such mutual funds. During regional and other meetings,
          another of Edward Jones' region leaders, who was also a general
          partner encouraged IRs in his region to sell the mutual funds of
          one Preferred Family over the funds of another Preferred Family
          that paid less revenue sharing.



<PAGE>
                                     7


     16.  Edward Jones' IRs receive credits for the amount of revenue
          sharing that Edward Jones receives from the IRs' proportionate
          sales and customer holdings of funds from the Preferred Families.
          These credits were not directly paid to IRs but were applied as a
          separate line item to the profit and loss statements ("P&Ls")
          prepared for each IR's office. These P&Ls are distributed monthly
          to the IRs and track their profitability to the Firm. An IR's
          profitability to the Firm determines whether the IR is successful
          at Edward Jones and is used as a factor in determining whether the
          IR will be considered for status as a limited partner. In
          addition, three times per year, Edward Jones' IRs are eligible to
          receive bonuses based, in part, on their overall profitability
          which is impacted by their revenue sharing credits. For an IR to
          receive a bonus in any of Edward Jones' three annual bonus
          periods, both the Firm and the particular IR's office must be
          profitable during the period. In addition, if an IR has worked for
          Edward Jones for more than 30 months, the IR also needs to make at
          least $4,000 in profits to become eligible for a bonus. Edward
          Jones' top-producing IRs have received as much as an additional
          $5,000 per bonus period as the part of their bonuses based on
          revenue sharing payments attributable to the IRs' sales and
          customer holdings of funds from Preferred Families to their retail
          customers.

     17.  Edward Jones further offers "diversification contest" trips to its
          IRs two times each year. During these contests, the IRs can
          qualify for a trip by earning points based on, among other things,
          their sales of mutual funds. Once an IR earns a specific number of
          points, the IR "wins" a trip. Although the IRs generally can earn
          contest points for selling any mutual funds or other investment
          product, for a ninety-day period in the fall of 2002, Edward Jones
          only gave mutual fund contest points for the sale of a subset of
          mutual funds from the Preferred Families. One or more of the
          Preferred Families always participate in the sponsorship of the
          diversification trips and make one short training presentation for
          the IRs during each trip. Sponsorship of these trips and other
          meetings provide the Preferred Families with exclusive access to
          and visibility with the IRs.

     18.  The Preferred Families receive certain benefits not otherwise
          available to nonpreferred families. First, Edward Jones
          exclusively promotes the seven Preferred Families on its public
          website and exclusively provides links to the Preferred Families'
          websites on Edward Jones' internal computer system accessible only
          to its IRs. Second, Edward Jones exclusively lists the Preferred
          Families in sales literature and newsletters provided to its
          customers. Third, Edward Jones provides its IRs with research on
          only the seven Preferred Families and maintains a "Preferred Funds
          List" containing the names of approximately 110 mutual funds
          within the Preferred Families that Edward Jones' Product Review
          department recommends for sale to Edward Jones' retail customers.
          Only funds from the seven Preferred Families are considered for
          inclusion on this list. The Product Review department does not
          review any mutual funds from fund families that are not Preferred
          Families for this "Preferred Funds List." Fourth, Edward Jones
          uses only the Preferred Families as examples in its internal
          training sessions for new IRs and only invites representatives
          from the Preferred Families to make presentations at these
          training sessions. Finally, Edward Jones facilitates exclusive
          direct access for the Preferred Families to its IRs



                                     8


          for the dissemination of marketing materials and to answer IRs'
          questions regarding the funds offered by the Preferred Families.

     FAILURE TO DISCLOSE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO SELL MUTUAL FUNDS FROM
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
                        THE PREFERRED FUND FAMILIES
                        ---------------------------


     19.  The mutual fund section of Edward Jones' public website lists only
          the seven Preferred Families and provides links to only the
          Preferred Families' websites. In addition, since approximately
          1997, Edward Jones has claimed on its public website that it
          focuses on the seven Preferred Families because: "With nearly
          11,000 mutual funds available, it can be difficult to know which
          fund(s) to pick. That's why at Edward Jones, we focus on seven
          preferred mutual fund families that share our same commitment to
          service, long-term investment objectives, and long-term
          performance."

     20.  During the same time period, Edward Jones did not disclose on its
          website or in any other written document that it prepared, the
          revenue sharing, directed brokerage payments and other payments
          received from the Preferred Families for distribution of mutual
          fund shares as described above. Edward Jones also did not disclose
          the dimensions of the potential financial conflict created by
          these payments.

     21.  Edward Jones and its IRs do not orally disclose to customers the
          revenue sharing, directed brokerage and other payments received by
          Edward Jones in connection with the distribution of mutual fund
          shares or the potential conflict of interest such payments create.

     22.  Instead, Edward Jones claimed to rely on language contained in the
          Preferred Families' prospectuses and Statements of Additional
          Information ("SAIs") to disclose revenue sharing arrangements. At
          all relevant times, Edward Jones required its IRs to provide
          customers with a prospectus at the point-of-sale or with the
          confirmation of sale of any mutual fund; however, the Firm did not
          require its IRs to provide and IRs did not provide customers with
          copies of SAIs unless a customer specifically requested a copy.

     23.  Many of the Preferred Families' prospectuses and SAIs fail to
          disclose adequate information about the source and amount of the
          revenue sharing payments to Edward Jones and the dimensions of the
          resulting potential conflicts of interest. Although the Preferred
          Families' prospectuses and SAIs contained various disclosures
          concerning payments to broker-dealers distributing their funds,
          few of these disclosures adequately described Edward Jones'
          potential conflict of interest.

     24.  During the relevant time period, Edward Jones also has not had
          sufficient procedures in place to ensure that someone with
          appropriate knowledge, experience and authority reviews the
          prospectuses and SAIs of the mutual funds offered by the Preferred
          Families to determine if they adequately disclose revenue sharing
          and directed

          brokerage payments made to Edward Jones or the other incentives
          offered to Edward Jones by the Preferred Families.

             FAILURE TO DISCLOSE REVENUE SHARING PAYMENTS IN THE
             ---------------------------------------------------
                     SALE OF 529 COLLEGE SAVINGS PLANS
                     ---------------------------------

     25.  Since 2000, Edward Jones has offered and sold 529 college savings
          plans to its customers. Offers and sales of 529 plans are
          municipal securities transactions. Prior to September 2004, Edward
          Jones stated on its public website that "the 529 plans available
          through Edward Jones" were three plans offered by three of its
          Preferred Families. Also, prior to September 2004, Edward Jones
          provided additional detailed information on its public website
          about only these three 529 plans. Edward Jones did not list or
          provide information on its website regarding any of the other
          numerous 529 plans that it could sell.

     26.  Edward Jones currently has selling agreements with 14 mutual fund
          companies to sell their 529 plans. However, Edward Jones promotes
          only the 529 plans of the Preferred Families that offer 529 plans,
          two of which pay additional revenue sharing to Edward Jones for
          sales of 529 plans. Edward Jones expressly encourages its IRs to
          sell only the 529 plans of the Preferred Families. In internal
          notices to its IRs announcing the availability of 529 plans from
          non-preferred families, Edward Jones explicitly states: "Edward
          Jones will continue to promote only our preferred vendors' 529
          plans . . . Although we have a selling agreement with [another 529
          plan], they are not one of our preferred vendors. However, if one
          of your clients feel [sic] the advantages of [another 529 plan]
          are important factors in their decision, you can sell it." In
          addition, Edward Jones has made it easier for its IRs to sell and
          service the Preferred Families' 529 plans versus non-preferred 529
          plans.

     27.  At the same time, Edward Jones has failed to disclose on its
          website or in any other written documents prepared by Edward
          Jones, including confirmations of 529 plan sales, the material
          financial incentives to Edward Jones, its partners and its IRs to
          sell 529 plans from certain of the Preferred Families over other
          529 plans that Edward Jones could sell.

     28.  Based on the conduct described above, Edward Jones willfully
          violated:

          a.   Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which provides that
               it is "unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any
               securities . . . by the use of any means or instruments of
               transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by
               use of the mails, directly or indirectly . . . to obtain
               money or property by means of any untrue statement of a
               material fact or any omission to state a material fact
               necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
               the circumstances under which they were made, not
               misleading;"

          b.   Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act, which provides in
               pertinent part that it is "unlawful for any broker or dealer
               to effect for or with an account of a customer any
               transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale by such
               customer of, any

                                     10


               security . . . unless such broker or dealer, at or before
               completion of such transaction, gives or sends to such
               customer written notification disclosing . . . the source and
               amount of any other remuneration received or to be received
               by the broker in connection with the transaction;" and

          c.   Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, which provides that
               "[n]o broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall
               make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
               interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to
               induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any
               municipal security in contravention of any rule of the
               [Municipal Securities Rulemaking] Board."

     29.  By virtue of its sales of 529 college savings plans, as described
          above, Edward Jones also contravened the dictates of Municipal
          Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") Rule G-15, which requires a
          broker or dealer to send or give a written confirmation to its
          customer, at or before the completion of a municipal securities
          transaction, that discloses, among other things, either: "(A) the
          source and amount of any remuneration received or to be received .
          . . by the broker [or] dealer . . . in connection with the
          transaction from any person other than the customer, or (B) a
          statement indicating whether any such remuneration has been or
          will be received and that the source and amount of such other
          remuneration will be furnished upon written request of the
          customer."

                     FAILURE TO SUPERVISE LATE TRADING
                     ---------------------------------

     30.  Under the provisions of federal securities laws, mutual fund
          transactions received after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
          ("EST") are to be given the next day's net asset value (NAV).
          Under a practice commonly known as late trading, a trader may seek
          to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. but that
          are not reflected in that day's price, by waiting until after 4:00
          p.m. to place a trade order, but arrange to receive that day's
          NAV.

     31.  Prior to November 2003, the Firm permitted IRs to enter mutual
          fund trades after 4:00 p.m. EST and still receive the same day's
          NAV. As a standard operating practice, trades entered in the
          Edward Jones' computer system after 4:00 p.m. EST were
          automatically assigned the next day's NAV. Under certain
          circumstances described below, however, the Firm allowed mutual
          fund transactions entered after 4:00 p.m. EST to be allocated the
          same day's NAV. These transactions were referred to as "released
          trades."

     32.  Prior to November 30, 2003, between 4:01 p.m. EST and 4:45 p.m.
          EST, the Firm allowed IRs to call the Service Division at Edward
          Jones Headquarters and request that a trade entered after the 4:00
          p.m. EST be "released" and allocated the same day's NAV. In order
          to "release" the trade, a Service Division representative was
          required to ask the IRs if the trade order had been received prior
          to 4:00 p.m. EST.


<PAGE>
                                     11


     33.  The Firm had between approximately 75 and 100 service specialists,
          members of an internal support group who had the ability to
          approve released trades. Between May 2003 and November 2003, the
          Firm identified approximately 8,700 instances where an order was
          entered, changed or cancelled after 4:00 P.M. and the execution
          price was based on the same day's NAV. Typically, the only
          question posed to the IR by the service representatives was
          whether the IR received the order prior to 4:00 p.m. EST. Once the
          IR answered the question in the affirmative, the trade was
          released and allocated that day's NAV.

     34.  Beyond released trades, the Firm also permitted trade corrections.
          If a transaction entered by an IR into the Firm's computer system
          prior to 4:00 pm EST had administrative errors, an IR was allowed
          to correct after the fact, among other things, the quantity and
          fund name of the mutual fund trade without any prior supervisory
          approval. Such trade corrections, however, were listed on reports
          provided to the IR's field supervision director (compliance
          supervisor).

     35.  Edward Jones did not have adequate policies and procedures in
          place to approve released trades or to determine whether trades
          were legitimately allocated the same day's NAV until November
          2003.

     36.  The Firm failed to provide the service representatives with
          written policies and/or procedures delineating the criteria for
          approving released trades. Moreover, the Firm had no mechanism to
          document either requests made or approvals granted for the purpose
          of releasing late trades. Edward Jones also did not have policies
          and/or procedures for supervisory review of decisions to grant
          requests for released trades.

     37.  The Firm's failure to adopt specific procedures in order to
          supervise this process properly, resulted in the Firm's inability
          to prevent and detect any abuse of this system by IRs and any
          unlawful late trading that may have existed.

         FAILURE TO PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION
         ---------------------------------------------------------

     38.  Edward Jones has more than 8,000 branch offices staffed primarily
          by one or two registered Investment Representatives. As such, the
          majority of communication between its associated persons is via a
          number of electronic systems maintained by the Firm. The
          electronic communications include "home office" electronic mail
          ("e-mails") (communications used within the home office, that is,
          by headquarters personnel located principally in St. Louis),
          "wires" (communications via the Firm's proprietary in-house
          computer system between IRs and Edward Jones' home office
          personnel), and Internet e-mails for registered representatives.

     39.  Despite the requirements to maintain copies of e-mails (and keep
          such copies readily accessible for two years), Edward Jones failed
          to preserve home office and wire emails for an eight-month period
          and failed to preserve Internet e-mails for one year. Further,
          Edward Jones failed to retain home office e-mails sent and
          received during a nine-month period in a readily accessible place.

                               APPLICABLE LAW
                               --------------

     40.  Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act which provides that it is
          "unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities .
          . . by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or
          communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails,
          directly or indirectly . . . to obtain money or property by means
          of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to
          state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
          made, in light of the circumstances under which they made, not
          misleading".

     41.  Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act, which provides in pertinent
          part that "it shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to effect
          for or with an account of a customer any transaction in, or to
          induce the purchase or sale by such customer of, any security . .
          . unless such broker or dealer, at or before completion of such
          transaction, gives or sends to such customer written notification
          disclosing . . . the source and amount of any other remuneration
          received or to be received by the broker in connection with the
          transaction."

     42.  Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") Rule G-15, which
          requires a broker or dealer to send or give a written confirmation
          to its customer, at or before the completion of a municipal
          securities transaction, that discloses, among other things,
          either: "(A) the source and amount of any remuneration received or
          to be received . . . by the broker [or] dealer . . . in connection
          with the transaction from any person other than the customer, or
          (B) a statement indicating whether any such remuneration has been
          or will be received and that the source and amount of such other
          remuneration will be furnished upon written request of the
          customer."

     43.  Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires broker dealers to
          "make and keep for proscribed periods" certain records, and SEC
          Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder requires broker dealers to "preserve
          for a period of not less than 3 years, the final two years in an
          accessible place....[o]riginals of all communications received and
          copies of all communications sent...relating to [the broker
          dealer's] business as such."

     44.  Exchange Rule 401 requires Exchange member organizations to
          "adhere to the principles of good business practice in the conduct
          of his or its business affairs." Similarly, Exchange Rule
          476(a)(6) provides for sanctions if Exchange member organizations
          engage in conduct "inconsistent with just and equitable principles
          of trade."

     45.  Exchange Rule 342 provides that "[e]ach office, department or
          business activity of a member or member organization...shall be
          under the supervision and control of the member or member
          organization establishing it and of the personnel delegated such
          authority and responsibility."

     46.  NYSE Rule 440 requires members to comply with SEC rule 17a-4.

                                  DECISION
                                  --------

The Hearing Panel, in accepting the Stipulation of Facts and Consent to
Penalty, found the Firm guilty as set forth above by unanimous vote.

                                  PENALTY
                                  -------

In view of the above findings, the Hearing Panel, by unanimous vote, imposed
the penalty consented to by the Firm as set forth below:

The imposition by the Exchange, the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") of a sanction of a
censure and a total payment in the amount of $ 75 million, as follows(2)

     1.   $ 37.5 million as a penalty; and

     2.   $ 37.5 million as disgorgement that will be placed into a customer
          reimbursement fund to compensate customers harmed by the Firm's
          violative conduct as set forth herein.

     3.   There shall be, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
          Act of 2002, a Fair Fund established for the funds described.
          Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made,
          amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to
          this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government
          for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the
          deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Edward Jones agrees that it
          shall not, after offset or reduction in any Related Investor
          Action based on Edward Jones' payment of disgorgement in this
          action, further benefit by offset or reduction of any part of
          Edward Jones' payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty
          Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such
          a Penalty Offset, Edward Jones agrees that it shall, within 30
          days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset,
          notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount
          of the Penalty Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair
          Fund, as the Commission directs. Such a payment shall not be
          deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to
          change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding.
          For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means
          a private damages action brought against Edward Jones by or on
          behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same
          facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
          proceeding.

     4.   Pursuant to an escrow agreement not unacceptable to the Exchange,
          Edward Jones shall, within 90 days of the entry of this Order, pay
          the Disgorgement and Penalties into an escrow account as specified
          by the Commission's Order. The escrow



<FN>
- ------------------------
(2) Payment of this pursuant to an order issued in a related SEC proceeding
    (the "Commission's Order") shall be deemed payment in satisfaction of
    this Stipulation and Consent. The terms of the payment and the
    distribution of the penalty and disgorgement amounts are set forth in
    the Commission's Order.



<PAGE>
                                     14


          agreement shall, among other things: (1) require that all funds in
          escrow be invested as soon as reasonably possible and to the
          extent practicable in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with
          maturities not to exceed six months; (2) name an escrow agent who
          shall be appropriately bonded; and (3) provide that escrowed funds
          be disbursed only pursuant to an order of the Commission. Edward
          Jones shall be responsible for all costs associated with the
          escrow agreement and the Fair Fund distribution.

     5.   Respondent Edward Jones agrees that it shall not seek or accept,
          directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification from any
          source including, but not limited to, payment made pursuant to any
          insurance policy, with regard to any penalty amounts that
          Respondent shall pay pursuant to this Order, regardless of whether
          such penalty amounts or any part thereof are added to a
          distribution fund or otherwise used for the benefit of investors.
          Respondent further agrees that it shall not claim, assert, or
          apply for a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any
          federal, state or local tax for any penalty amounts that
          Respondent shall pay pursuant to this Order, regardless of whether
          such penalty amounts or any part thereof are added to a
          distribution fund or otherwise used for the benefit of investors.

     6.   Within 60 days of the date of the final decision in this matter,
          Edward Jones shall submit to the Independent Consultant for review
          (and simultaneously to the Exchange staff) a plan (Distribution
          Plan) pursuant to which Edward Jones shall administer and
          distribute the monetary sums ordered to be paid. The Distribution
          Plan shall address how such monetary sums shall be distributed to
          benefit customers who purchased through Edward Jones mutual funds
          of the Preferred Mutual Fund Families between January 1, 1999 and
          the date of the entry of the Stipulation and Facts to Consent to
          Penalty. The Distribution Plan shall not be unacceptable to the
          Independent Consultant. If the Independent Consultant finds that
          the Distribution Plan is unacceptable, Edward Jones shall attempt
          in good faith to reach an agreement with the Independent
          Consultant within 90 days of the entry of the Order. In the event
          that Edward Jones and the Independent Consultant are unable to
          agree on an alternative proposal, Edward Jones shall abide by the
          recommendation of the Independent Consultant. The final
          Distribution Plan shall be submitted, and must be acceptable, to
          the Exchange.

The requirement by the SEC, Exchange and NASD that the Firm shall complete
an appropriate undertaking to ensure compliance with federal securities laws
and Exchange rules governing the Firm's business, as follows:

     i.   Edward Jones shall place and maintain on the mutual fund portion
          of its public website within 15 days of the date of entry of this
          Order disclosures regarding its Preferred Mutual Fund Family
          program ("program") to include: (i) the existence of the program;
          (ii) the mutual fund families participating in the program; (iii)

     viii. Edward Jones shall retain, within 60 days of the date of entry of

           exclusively bear all costs, including compensation and expenses,
           associated with the retention of the Independent Consultant.
           Edward Jones shall retain the Independent Consultant to conduct a
           comprehensive review of: (i) the adequacy of the policies and
           procedures that Edward Jones is required to devise and implement
           under this Order; and (ii) whether Edward Jones' receipt and
           disclosure of revenue sharing payments is in compliance with this
           Order, the federal securities laws and the MSRB rules.

     ix.   Edward Jones shall further retain the Independent Consultant to,
           at the conclusion of the review, which in no event shall be more
           than 120 days after the date of entry of this Order, submit to
           Edward Jones and to the Commission's Staff an Initial Report. The
           Initial Report shall address, at a minimum: (i) the adequacy of
           the policies and procedures that Edward Jones is required to
           devise and implement under this Order; and (ii) whether Edward
           Jones' receipt and disclosure of revenue sharing payments is in
           compliance with this Order, the federal securities laws and the
           MSRB rules. The Initial Report must include a description of the
           review performed, the conclusions reached, and the Independent
           Consultant's recommendations for modifications and additions to
           the policies and procedures devised and implemented by Edward
           Jones.

     x.    Within 150 days from the date of the entry of the Order, Edward
           Jones shall in writing advise the Independent Consultant and the
           Commission's Staff of the recommendations from the initial report
           that it is adopting and the recommendations that it considers to
           be unnecessary or inappropriate. With respect to any
           recommendation that Edward Jones considers unnecessary or
           inappropriate, Edward Jones shall explain why the objective or
           purpose of such recommendation is unnecessary or inappropriate
           and provide in writing an alternative policy, procedure, or
           system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.

     xi.   With respect to any recommendation with which Edward Jones and
           the Independent Consultant do not agree, Edward Jones shall
           attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with the Independent
           Consultant within 180 days from the date of the entry of the
           Order. In the event that the Independent Consultant and Edward
           Jones are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, Edward
           Jones and the Independent Consultant shall jointly confer with
           the Commission's Staff to resolve the matter.

                                     17


     xii.  Edward Jones shall further retain the Independent Consultant to
           conduct a follow up review and submit a written Final Report to
           Edward Jones and to the Commission's Staff no later than one year
           after the date of entry of this Order. In the Final Report, the
           Independent Consultant shall address Edward Jones' compliance
           with this Order, its implementation of the policies and
           procedures adopted under this Order, and make any further
           recommendations he or she deems necessary. Within 30 days of its
           receipt of the Independent Consultant's Final Report, Edward
           Jones shall adopt the recommendations contained in the Final
           Report.

     xiii. Within 60 days of the date of the entry of this Order, Edward
           Jones shall submit to the Independent Consultant for review (and
           simultaneously to the Commission staff) a plan ("Distribution
           Plan") pursuant to which the Independent Consultant shall
           administer and distribute the monetary sums ordered to be paid
           pursuant to the Penalty section through paragraph 6 above. The
           Distribution Plan shall address how such monetary sums shall be
           distributed to benefit customers who purchased through Edward
           Jones mutual funds of the Preferred Families between January 1,
           1999 and the date of the entry of this Order. The Distribution
           Plan shall not be unacceptable to the Independent Consultant. If
           the Independent Consultant finds that the Distribution Plan is
           unacceptable, Edward Jones shall attempt in good faith to reach
           an agreement with the Independent Consultant within 90 days of
           the entry of this Order. In the event that Edward Jones and the
           Independent Consultant are unable to agree on an alternative
           proposal, Edward Jones shall abide by the recommendation of the
           Independent Consultant. The final Distribution Plan shall be
           submitted, and must be acceptable, to the Commission Staff.

     xiv.  Edward Jones shall cooperate fully with the Independent
           Consultant and shall provide the Independent Consultant with
           access to Edward Jones' files, books, records and personnel as
           reasonably requested by the Independent Consultant.

     xv.   For good cause shown, and upon receipt of a timely application
           from the Independent Consultant or Edward Jones, the Commission's
           Staff may extend any of the procedural dates set forth above

     xvi.  To ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant, Edward
           Jones: (i) shall not have the authority to terminate the
           Independent Consultant, without the prior written approval of the
           Commission's Staff; (ii) shall compensate the Independent
           Consultant, and persons engaged to assist the Independent
           Consultant, for services rendered pursuant to this Order at their
           reasonable and customary rates; (iii) shall not be in and shall
           not have an attorney-client relationship with the Independent
           Consultant and shall not seek to invoke the attorney-client
           privilege or any other doctrine or privilege to prevent the
           Independent Consultant from transmitting any information,
           reports, or documents to the Commission or the Commission's
           Staff.

     xvii. To further ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant,
           Edward Jones shall require the Independent Consultant to enter
           into an agreement that provides that for the period of the
           engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the

           engagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into any
           employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other
           professional relationship with Edward Jones, or any of its
           present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or
           agents acting in their capacity. Any firm with which the
           Independent Consultant is affiliated in performance of his or her
           duties under this Order shall not, without prior written consent
           of the Commission's Staff, enter into any employment, consultant,
           attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with
           Edward Jones, or any of its present or former affiliates,
           directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their
           capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a
           period of two years after the engagement.

                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                        EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI


                      DEFERRED CONSIDERATION AGREEMENT


                  EDWARD D. JONES & COMPANY, L.P. ("Edward Jones")(1), by its
undersigned attorneys, pursuant to authority granted by the Executive
Committee of Edward Jones (a copy of a resolution to this effect is attached
hereto as Exhibit A), and the United States Attorney's Office for the
          ---------
Eastern District of Missouri (the "Office"), hereby enter into this Deferred
Consideration Agreement (the "Agreement").

                                 BACKGROUND
                                 ----------

                  1. The Office has investigated the conduct of Edward Jones
relating to revenue sharing payments made by certain mutual funds that have
been designated as preferred funds ("Preferred Fund Families" or "Preferred
Funds"), including other special compensation arrangements such as equity
investments ("Revenue Sharing").

                  2. The Office has determined to defer consideration of any
action stemming from this investigation regarding Revenue Sharing in
consideration for the execution and implementation of this Agreement by
Edward Jones.

                  3. For purposes solely of this investigation and any
subsequent judicial proceeding by this Office, but not as an admission to be
made in any way in any civil, regulatory, administrative or other legal
proceeding, Edward Jones acknowledges the following conduct committed during
the relevant time period:

                           (a) Edward Jones recommended Preferred Funds to
Edward Jones' customers. While most of the Preferred Funds were designated
as such before the


<FN>
- --------
(1)   For purposes of this Agreement, Edward Jones is defined to include its
affiliates The Jones Financial Companies, L.L.L.P. and EDJ Holding Company,
Inc.


commencement of the payment of revenue sharing, eventually all of the
Preferred Funds provided some form of revenue sharing to Edward Jones.
Although circumstances varied among the Preferred Funds once Edward Jones
began receiving revenue sharing, Edward Jones did not provide a disclosure
about the receipt of revenue sharing to its customers separate and apart
from the disclosures set forth, or to be set forth, in the Prospectuses or
Statements of Additional Information issued by the Preferred Funds;

                           (b) Edward Jones sometimes promoted to its
brokers, known within Edward Jones as Investment Representatives ("IRs"),
the existence of revenue sharing by Preferred Families, as well as
permitted, and on occasion encouraged, IRs, on a case-by-case basis, to
consider revenue sharing in making recommendations to their customers to
purchase certain mutual funds;

                           (c) The website for Edward Jones discussed
Preferred Funds but did not disclose revenue sharing with respect to such
funds.

                           (d) Revenue sharing was one of several important
factors in the selection of two Preferred Funds. With respect to the
retention of funds as preferred, revenue sharing was again important among
several considerations.

                           (e) On January 22, 2004, the SEC Staff informed
Edward Jones that the Staff intended to recommend an SEC enforcement action
against Edward Jones based on its revenue sharing activities. The Staff gave
Edward Jones until February 3, 2003 to make a Wells Submission. Edward Jones
submitted a Wells Submission on that date, prior to concluding its inquiry
into the matter. Certain statements in the Wells Submission were inaccurate.

                  4. Edward Jones, in further consideration for this
Agreement, agrees to undertake the following:


                                     2

                           (a) Enter into an Agreement (the "SEC Agreement")
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the National
Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") and the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") pursuant to which Edward Jones will pay Seventy-Five Million
Dollars ($75,000,000.00) to be distributed to Edward Jones' customers in
accordance with procedures established pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 7246,
commonly known as the "Fair Fund" and as implemented by the terms of the SEC
Agreement in resolution of any claims of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange pertaining to Revenue
Sharing;

                           (b) Continue to fully cooperate with the Office,
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
("FBI" and collectively, the "Investigative Entities") and the SEC;

                           (c) Make adequate disclosures (i) to current
Edward Jones customers, (ii) to customers at point of sale, (iii) to its
Investment Representatives through training materials and other educational
means, and (iv) on Edward Jones' website regarding the payment of revenue
sharing in forms agreeable to this Office, and not inconsistent with the
requirements imposed by the SEC or to be established in accordance with
rules and regulations to be issued by the SEC;

                           (d) To minimize the possibility described in
Paragraph 3(b) above, revise Edward Jones' bonus methodology for IRs by
allocating fees for determining the IR bonus on the basis of assets under
management for an IR;

                           (e) Offer to Edward Jones' customers currently
holding shares in Preferred Funds for a period of ninety days the
opportunity to switch such holdings without the payment of certain fees by
selling the customers' interest in the Preferred Funds at net asset value to
purchase shares of mutual funds in either a different Preferred Fund or any
other mutual

                                     3

fund with which Edward Jones has a selling agreement (the "Switch Funds").
For this purpose, commissions typically paid to Edward Jones and the Switch
Funds commonly known as the "load" will either be waived by Edward Jones and
the Switch Funds or Edward Jones will pass through the commissions received
by Edward Jones and the Switch Funds back to the customers;

                           (f) Allocate responsibility for the payment of
the amount due under the SEC Agreement with disproportionate impact upon the
general partners, subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Office,
including restoring to the Edward Jones limited partners the income that
would otherwise have been paid this Quarter and eliminating the taxable
impact otherwise payable by the limited partners attributable the payments
due under the SEC Agreement;

                           (g) Institute a Corporate Governance Program with
an independent employee of Edward Jones reporting to a reconstituted
Executive Committee solely for this purpose with the following
responsibility:

                                    (i)      appropriate disclosures of
                                             conflicts of interest involving
                                             the payments by Preferred Funds
                                             to Edward Jones customers,
                                             including revenue sharing; (2)
                                             establish a telephone hotline
                                             by which employees may
                                             anonymously report potential
                                             violations of the law and to
                                             publicize to employees the
                                             purpose and existence of the
                                             hotline and provide assurance
                                             that no negative action will be
                                             taken based on the submission
                                             of hotline reports; (3)
                                             adoption of procedures to
                                             ensure that all inquiries by
                                             government entities and by
                                             Investment Representatives
                                             regarding disclosures of
                                             conflicts of interest receive
                                             prompt review, including

                                     4

                                             appropriate, to the Compliance
                                             Department, the Managing
                                             Partner or the Executive

                                             deleterious to Edward Jones.

                                            a grand jury or in court

                                            identification of witnesses who,
                                            to Edward Jones' knowledge and
                                            information, may have material
                                            information.

                           (e) Providing testimony or information necessary
to identify or establish the original location, authenticity or other basis
for admission into evidence of documents or physical evidence in any
proceeding as requested by the Investigative Entities; and

                           (f) With respect to any information, testimony,
documents, records or physical evidence provided by Edward Jones to the
Investigative Entities or a grand jury, Edward Jones consents to any and all
disclosures of such materials to such Investigative Entities as the Office,
in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. With respect to any such
materials that constitute "matters occurring before the grand jury" within
the meaning of Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Edward
Jones further consents to:

                                    (i)      any order sought by the Office
                                             permitting such disclosures;
                                             and

                                    (ii)     the Office's ex parte or in
                                             camera application for such
                                             orders.

                           (g) The disclosure of information set forth above
is limited solely to the disclosure to the Investigative Entities for
purposes of federal enforcement matters and does not constitute a waiver in
any respect of any privileges of Edward Jones for any other purpose or any
other proceeding.

                  6. Edward Jones agrees that, following the expiration of
this Agreement, Edward Jones will continue to fulfill the cooperation
obligations set forth in Paragraph 5 above in connection with any
investigation or proceeding brought by any of the Investigative Entities
relating to or arising out of the conduct addressed herein. Edward Jones'
obligation to cooperate is not intended to apply in the event that Edward
Jones is a defendant in any such proceeding.

                  7. Edward Jones shall not, through its attorneys, senior
management or agents, make any public statement contradictory to the express
terms of the acknowledgments set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement.
Upon the Office learning that Edward Jones has made a public statement in
violation of this provision, the United States Attorney shall notify

                                     7

Edward Jones of the apparent violation and Jones will have three days to
cure the apparent violation by repudiating the public statement that
constituted the violation of this provision.

                  8. This Agreement may be made public by the Office.

                  9. Edward Jones agrees that the statute of limitations is
tolled for the duration of this Agreement with respect to any action that
may be initiated by the Office with respect to Revenue Sharing. Edward Jones
does not waive or forfeit its right to assert any statute of limitations
defenses that may be available as of the date of this Agreement.

                  10. This Agreement is binding on this Office but
specifically does not bind any other Federal agencies, any state or local
law enforcement agencies, any licensing authorities, or any regulatory
authorities. However, if requested by Edward Jones or its attorneys, the
Office will bring to the attention of any such agencies the cooperation of
Edward Jones and its compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.
It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the Agreement does
not confer or provide any benefits, privileges or rights to any individual
or other entity other than the parties hereto, and that neither the
Agreement nor anything contained herein shall be admissible in any
proceeding other than a proceeding brought by the Office. Moreover, Edward
Jones may raise defenses and/or assert affirmative claims in any civil
proceedings brought by private parties as long as doing so does not
otherwise violate any term of this Agreement.

                  11. This Agreement will remain in effect for a period of
twenty-four months during which time Edward Jones will provide a quarterly
report to the Office detailing its progress in satisfying the requirements
of this Agreement.

                  12. In consideration of Edward Jones' remedial actions to
date and its agreement to: (a) acknowledge the conduct as set forth in
Paragraph 3; (b) continue its cooperation with the Office, the SEC and the
Investigative Entities; (c) take the actions required


                                     8

and make the payments specified in Paragraph 4; (d) comply with Federal
laws, including Federal securities laws; and (e) otherwise comply with all
of the terms of this Agreement, the Office will defer consideration of any
action for a period of twenty-four months and shall not initiate action at
the end of the twenty four month period regarding Revenue Sharing if the
obligations of Edward Jones under the Agreement have been satisfied.
