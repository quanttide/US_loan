Issuance of Stock Grants,<br>
Officer Appointment and Director Retirement</font></b></p>

<p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">MIDLAND, TX &#151; Cap
Rock Energy Corporation (AmEx: RKE) today announced a grant of restricted stock
to all company employees and directors in recognition of the company&#146;s
successful transition to an investor-owned utility and its high rates of customer
satisfaction.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">These restricted stock grants are part of the Company&#146;s continuing
effort to reward and provide incentives to employees and directors, for
developing one of the best electric utilities in the southwest, according to
David W. Pruitt, President/CEO and Co-Chairman of the Board.&#160; The Company was the first electric
cooperative in the nation to change its corporate structure to a shareholder
owned corporation and it has created approximately $100 million in value for
its shareholders in the process.&#160;&#160; The
restricted stock grants allow the Company to reward employees and directors at
no cost to the Company&#146;s customers, since the stock grants are not included in
the Company&#146;s rate base.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;It has been our
model all along to have a part of all employee compensation paid in stock in
their Company as a reward for their efforts and as an incentive for future
success,&#148; Pruitt said. &#147;This model was approved by our shareholders in 2002 and
has proven to be a success. We have performed very well for our shareholders
and our customers since changing from an electric cooperative to an
investor-owned utility and we have laid the groundwork for other electric
cooperatives to follow our lead.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;This was not an
easy transition and our success is due to the continued efforts of our
dedicated employees and directors. These restricted stock grants are a reward
to our employees for their commitment and hard work&#160; as Cap Rock&#146;s high level of customer
satisfaction is directly related to their efforts.&#160; The dilution effect of the</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">restricted stock
grants is approximately 5% on the Company&#146;s stock.&#147;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Company
provides electric distribution services to its customers and is known for its
exemplary customer service. Cap Rock changed its corporate structure from an electric
cooperative to a shareholder owned corporation in 2002 and has experienced a
great deal of success since the transition, as evidenced by strong earnings and
rising stock prices.&#160; The approximately
120,000 shares of restricted stock awards require all recipients to continue to
hold at least 25% of the stock awarded as long as they remain with the Company.
These&#160; restricted stock awards will
ensure that the devoted employees who have contributed to the Company&#146;s success
will remain with the Company and benefit from its continued success.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Cap Rock Energy
also announced today that the Board, upon the recommendation of Mr. Pruitt,
elected Will West to serve as President of the Company.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Mr. West earned
both a Bachelors and a Masters degree in accounting from Texas A&amp;M
University and is a Certified Public Accountant.&#160; Prior to joining the Company, he was a part
of the senior management team of KPMG, LLC, and worked as a senior officer for
Benchmark, a privately held energy company operating across the southwest.&#160; Mr. West&#160;
joined Cap Rock Energy in July 2003 and most recently served as
Vice-President and Chief Strategic Officer.&#160;
Mr. West&#160; will immediately assume
the duties of President.&#160; Mr. Pruitt will
remain with the Company as CEO and Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Mr. West also was
appointed to serve on Cap Rock Energy&#146;s Board of Directors, replacing Newell
Tate, a longtime director of the Company and its predecessor, who announced his
intent to retire and submitted his resignation as a director.&#160; With Mr. Tate&#146;s retirement, the Board voted
to appoint Mr. West to fill his unexpired term.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;We are excited to
have someone of Will&#146;s caliber to serve as President of the Company and to
serve on the Board,&#148; Mr. Pruitt said.&#160; &#147;He
has continually taken on more and more responsibility since he came to us in
2003 and has proven to be an outstanding leader capable of making tough
decisions.&#148;&#160; Added Russell E. Jones,
Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors, &#147;Newell Tate will be greatly missed.
While we are blessed to have Will, we hate to lose Newell.&#160; He has been instrumental in making this
Company a success and in creating value for all of the customers and
shareholders of the Company and its predecessor.&#160; He has been a valuable member of the Board
for a long time and we wish him the very best.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Mr. West said, &#147; I
am very excited about the opportunity to lead this great Company and grateful
to David and the Board for their trust and vote of confidence.&#160; I will continue to build upon the strong
foundation that has been laid and look forward to guiding our Company in
becoming a leader in the industry.&#148;</font></p>
