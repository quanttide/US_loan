ITEM 3.02   UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

                  On December 27, 2004, the Company completed a private
placement of approximately 22,620,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50
per share, for aggregate gross consideration of $33.9 million. C.E. Unterberg,
Towbin LLC acted as the financial advisor for the Company in the private
placement and was paid a cash fee equal to seven percent of the gross proceeds
from the private placement, plus its legal costs and expenses. Net cash proceeds
were approximately $31.5 million, after compensation to the financial advisor
and payment of the financial advisor's expenses in the placement.

                  Approximately $4.7 million of the proceeds will be used to
repay borrowings from Laurus Master Fund under a revolving promissory note, and
$1.15 million of the proceeds were used to repay notes sold to affiliates of the
Company in a bridge financing completed in October 2004, which notes
automatically became due upon the closing of the private placement. The holders
of $600,000 in principal amount of these notes reinvested such amount in the
private placement. The Company is obligated to use an additional $10 million of
the net proceeds to repurchase 6,666,667 shares of common stock from William A.
Teitelbaum, a stockholder of the Company, pursuant to a Settlement Agreement
between the Company and Mr. Teitelbaum entered into in October 2004. The balance
of the net proceeds will be used primarily for working capital, general
corporate purposes and acquisitions.

                  Upon completion of the private placement, as of December 27,
2004, there were issued and outstanding 55,679,613 shares of the Company's
common stock, and warrants, convertible notes, options to purchase, and other
commitments to issue, an aggregate of approximately 20,460,000 additional shares
of the Company's common stock, together exceeding the total of 75,000,000 shares
of the Company's authorized common stock. The Company's directors have agreed to
suspend their rights to exercise options to purchase an aggregate of 2,400,000
shares of common stock until such time as the Company has available for issuance
a sufficient number of unissued shares of authorized common stock so as to
permit the conversion and exercise, as applicable, of all convertible securities
of the Company. This is expected to occur in January 2005 upon the repurchase of
6,666,667 shares of common stock from Mr. Teitelbaum pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement referred to above.

                  The common stock issued in the private placement was sold to
persons the Company reasonably believes are accredited investors, without public
solicitation or advertising, and the certificates issued for the common stock
issued in the private placement were endorsed with an appropriate restrictive
legend.

                  The Company has agreed to file a registration statement on or
before January 26, 2005 to register under the Securities Act the resale of the
shares of common stock issued in the private placement.

<PAGE>

                  As a result of the closing of the private placement, the
Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 766,666 shares of common
stock at a price of $1.50 per share to the investors in the Company's October
2004 bridge financing, in accordance with the Company's obligations under such
financing.
