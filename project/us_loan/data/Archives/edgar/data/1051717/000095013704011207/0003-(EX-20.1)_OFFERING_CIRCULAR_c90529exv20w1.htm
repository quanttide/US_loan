<FONT size="2">Before you participate in the exchange offer, you
should know that making an investment in either the New OCEANs
or the Existing OCEANs involves some risks, including the risks
described below. You should carefully consider the factors
described below in addition to the remainder of this offering
circular and the factors discussed in the documents and other
information incorporated by reference before tendering your
Existing OCEANs. The risk factors set forth below, other than
those that discuss the consequences of failing to exchange your
Existing OCEANs in the exchange offer or as otherwise noted, are
applicable to both the Existing OCEANs and the New OCEANs issued
in the exchange offer (collectively, the &#147;OCEANs&#148;).
The risks that we have highlighted here are not the only ones
that we face and additional risks, including those presently
unknown to us, could also impair our operations. If any of the
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or
results of operations could be negatively affected.

In addition, payment of dividends, distributions, loans or

<FONT size="2">Under the indenture governing the Existing
OCEANs, we agreed, and by acceptance of a beneficial interest in
an Existing OCEAN each holder of an Existing OCEAN is deemed to
have agreed, to treat the Existing OCEANs as indebtedness for
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes that is subject to the
Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt
instruments. Similar provisions will be included in the
Indenture governing the New OCEANs. Under the Treasury
regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments,
interest accrues on such an instrument for U.S.&nbsp;federal
income tax purposes at the comparable yield (rather than any
stated interest rate), which is the yield the issuer could have
issued a nonconvertible fixed-rate debt instrument with no
contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise
similar to the issued contingent payment debt instrument. At the
time the Existing OCEANs were issued, we determined the
comparable yield to be 9.917%. Assuming that the exchange of the
Existing OCEANs for the New OCEANs and the payment of the
exchange fee does not constitute a significant modification of
the terms of the Existing OCEANs, and therefore, that the New
OCEANs will be treated as a continuation of the Existing OCEANs
for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, interest on the New
OCEANs will accrue for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes at
the comparable yields that we determined for the Existing
OCEANs, which is 9.917%. A U.S.&nbsp;holder will be required to
accrue interest income on the New OCEANs on a constant yield to
maturity basis at the comparable yield as set forth above
(subject to certain adjustments), with the result that a

significantly in excess of regular interest payments received

<FONT size="2">At its September 2004 meeting, the Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF)&nbsp;of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;reached a conclusion on EITF Issue
No.&nbsp;04-8, &#147;The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt
on Diluted Earnings Per Share&#148;, that would require the
contingent shares issuable under our Existing OCEANs to be
included in our diluted earnings per share calculation
retroactive to the date of issuance by applying the &#147;if
converted&#148; method under FASB Statement No.&nbsp;128,
&#147;Earnings per Share&#148; (FAS&nbsp;128). We have followed
the existing interpretation of FAS&nbsp;128, which requires
inclusion of the impact of the conversion of our Existing OCEANs
only when and if the conversion thresholds are reached. As the
conversion thresholds have not been reached, we have not
included the impact of the conversion of our Existing OCEANs in
our computation for diluted earnings per share through the
periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2004.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The new rule, which has been approved by the FASB
and is awaiting resolution of another exposure draft which will
determine its effective date, will require us to restate
previously reported diluted earnings per share and will result
in lower diluted earnings per share than previously reported for
periods subsequent to the issuance of the Existing OCEANs. If
the exchange offer is completed prior to December&nbsp;31, 2004,
the restated diluted earnings per share will be calculated under
the terms of the New OCEANs and will result in lower diluted
earnings per share once our stock price meets the conversion
price. For all periods from the issuance of the Existing OCEANs
through September&nbsp;30, 2004, assuming exchange of all of the
Existing OCEANs, our diluted earnings per share would not have
been materially different from the reported amount. For the
nine-month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, our diluted
earnings per share would have been lower by approximately 0.98%.
If the exchange offer is not completed prior to the effective
date of the new rule, the restated diluted earnings per share
will be calculated under the term of the Existing OCEANs and
will result in lower diluted earnings per share of approximately
8.8% at September&nbsp;30, 2004.

National banks, with their large existing customer bases, may

the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine

services companies for sales representatives primarily on the
basis of our financial position, support services and
compensation and product features. Our competitiveness for such
agents also depends upon the relationships we develop with these
agents. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales
representatives to sell our products, our ability to compete and
our revenues would suffer.

<FONT size="2">During periods of declining interest rates,
borrowers may prepay or redeem mortgages and bonds that we own,
which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest
rates. Most of our insurance and annuity products provide for
guaranteed minimum yields and we are unable to lower our payouts
to customers in response to the lower return we will earn on our
investments. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to
maintain our desired spread between the investment income that
we earn and our payouts to customers during periods of declining
interest rates, thereby reducing our profitability. A reduction
in interest rates could also depress the market for our fixed
annuity products. While policyowners may pay surrender charges
to terminate policies, such terminations would reduce our future
income.

result, these methods may not accurately predict future
exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical
measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon the
evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other
matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us
and that may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or
properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and
regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and

failure of our risk management policies or procedures, its

benefits and claims. The liability that we have established for
future policy benefits is based on assumptions concerning a
number of factors, including the amount of premiums that we will
receive in the future, rate of return on assets we purchase with
premiums received, expected claims, expenses and persistency,
which is the measurement of the percentage of insurance policies
remaining in force from year to year, as measured by premiums.
However, due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high
degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the
liabilities for unpaid policy benefits and claims, we cannot
determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to
settle these liabilities. As a result, we may experience
volatility in the level of our reserves from period to period.
To the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable
than our underlying assumptions, we could be required to
increase our liabilities, which may harm our financial strength

<FONT size="2">In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities&#148;. SFAS&nbsp;133 requires us to include
all derivatives in our consolidated statement of financial
position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair
value of a derivative depends on its intended use. Changes in
derivative fair values are either recognized in earnings as
offsets to the changes in fair value of related hedged assets,
liabilities and firm commitments or, for forecasted
transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of equity
until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative&#146;s
change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.
Derivatives not used in hedging activities must be adjusted to
fair value through earnings. We adopted SFAS&nbsp;133 effective
January&nbsp;1, 2001. The cumulative effect of the application
of SFAS&nbsp;133 included a negative effect of $8.2&nbsp;million
on net income and a positive effect of $2.7&nbsp;million on
accumulated other comprehensive income. The impact of the
application of SFAS&nbsp;133 on net income during the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was a net unrealized
gain (loss) of $8.6&nbsp;million, ($14.6)&nbsp;million and
($5.8)&nbsp;million, respectively, and the impact to accumulated
other comprehensive income was an unrealized gain of
$2.5&nbsp;million, a gain of $3.4&nbsp;million and a loss of
$5.9&nbsp;million, respectively. The impact of the application
of SFAS&nbsp;133 on our net income during the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004 was a net unrealized loss of
$4.9&nbsp;million, and the impact on our accumulated other
comprehensive income was an unrealized gain of
$0.5&nbsp;million. The Company estimates that less than
$0.1&nbsp;million after-tax of derivative losses included in
AOCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve
months.

Derivatives Implementation Group issued DIG Issue B36, which
applies to modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds
withheld arrangements where interest is determined by reference
to a pool of fixed maturity assets or a total return debt index.
Such arrangements in which funds are withheld by the ceding
insurer cause the reinsurer to recognize a receivable from the
ceding insurer as well as a liability representing reserves for
the insurance coverage assumed under the reinsurance
arrangements. The terms of the ceding company&#146;s payable
provide for the future payment of principal plus a rate of
return on either its general account assets or a specified block
of those assets which is typically composed of fixed-rate debt
securities. DIG Issue B36 considers the payable from the ceding
company to contain an embedded derivative that must be
bifurcated and accounted for separately under SFAS&nbsp;133. We
adopted DIG Issue B36 on October&nbsp;1, 2003, which included
establishing an embedded derivative liability of

<FONT size="2">While life insurance companies have historically
been subject to substantial litigation resulting from claims
disputes and other matters, in recent years the life insurance
industry, including the Company and its subsidiaries, has been
subject to an increase in litigation pursued on behalf of
purported classes of insurance purchasers questioning the
conduct of insurers in the marketing of their products. The
Company is routinely involved in litigation and other
proceedings, including class actions (such as pending class
action lawsuits related to the use of purportedly inappropriate
sales techniques and products for the senior market),
reinsurance claims and regulatory proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of its business. Some of these claims and legal
actions are in jurisdictions where juries are given substantial
latitude in assessing damages, including punitive and exemplary
damages.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our litigation is subject to many uncertainties,
and given its complexity and scope, the outcomes cannot be
predicted. It is possible that our results of operations or cash
flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected by an ultimately unfavorable resolution of
pending litigation.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">In addition, state insurance departments are
escalating their scrutiny of insurance companies, including
increasingly focusing on sales practices and product issues in
their market conduct examinations (including the recently

<FONT size="2">In connection with the reorganization undertaken
by AmerUs in June 1996, AmerUs Life Insurance Company, or ALIC,
allocated specific assets for the benefit of insurance policies
and annuities that pay dividends or provide interest credits.
These allocated assets are referred to as a closed block. We
established a second closed block as of March&nbsp;31, 2000 in
connection with the reorganization of Indianapolis Life
Insurance Company, or ILICO, to a stock form (which, together
with the ALIC closed block, we refer to as the &#147;Closed
Block&#148;). The Closed Block was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to policyholders that, after the respective
reorganizations of ALIC and ILICO, assets would be available to
maintain policy dividends and interest credits in effect prior
to the reorganization if the experience underlying the existing
scales of such policy dividends and interest credits were to
continue. Any excess of cumulative favorable experience for
Closed Block policies over unfavorable experience will be
available for distribution over time to the Closed Block
policyowners and will not be available to us.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">AmerUs will continue to pay guaranteed benefits
under the policies included in the Closed Block in accordance
with their terms. Assets included in the Closed Block, cash
flows generated by these assets and anticipated revenues from
policies included in the Closed Block may not be sufficient to
provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If
they are not sufficient, AmerUs must fund the shortfall from its
general funds. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose for
business reasons to support dividend payments on policies in the
Closed Block with our general account funds.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Assets included in the Closed Block, cash flows
generated by such assets and anticipated revenues from policies
in the Closed Block will benefit only the holders of those
policies. Any excess earnings will be available for distribution
over time to Closed Block policyholders, but will not be
available to AmerUs stockholders. Unless the relevant state
Insurance Commissioner consents to an earlier termination, the
Closed Block will continue to be in effect until the date on
which none of the policies in the Closed Block remain in force.
We bear the costs of operating and managing the Closed Block
and, accordingly, such costs were not funded as part of the
assets allocated to the Closed Block. Any increase in such costs
in the future would be borne by us.

<FONT size="2">The continued threat of terrorism within the U.S.
and Europe, and the military action and heightened security
measures in response to that threat, may cause additional
disruptions to commerce, reduced economic activity and continued
volatility in markets throughout the world, which may decrease
our net income, revenue and assets under management. Some of the
assets in our investment portfolio, such as airline and leisure
industry securities, have been adversely affected by the
declines in the securities markets and economic activity caused
by the terrorist attacks and the military action and heightened
security measures. The effect of these events on the valuation
of these investments is uncertain and there may be additional
impairments.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Moreover, the cost and possibly the availability,
in the future, of reinsurance covering terrorist attacks for our
individual life, accidental death and dismemberment and
disability insurance operations are uncertain. Although our
ratings have not been affected by the terrorist attacks on the
U.S. and remain consistent, over time the rating agencies could
re-examine the ratings affecting the insurance industry
generally, including the ratings of our life insurance
subsidiaries. In addition, declines in the securities markets
and reduced commercial and economic activity may impact our
assumptions in assessing the value of intangibles from prior
acquisitions and the amortization patterns for deferred policy
acquisition costs. In the event there is a need to change our
assumptions, this may lead to a material impairment of these
assets.

<FONT size="2">On November&nbsp;15, 2004, the last reported sale
price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange was $44.04&nbsp;per share. As of November&nbsp;1, 2004,
there were approximately 107,591 holders of record of our common
stock.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We declared and paid a quarterly dividend of
$0.10&nbsp;per share of our common stock from the second quarter
of 1997 through the first quarter of 2000. Beginning in 2000,
our board of directors approved moving from a quarterly dividend
of $0.10&nbsp;per share of our common stock to an annual
dividend of $0.40&nbsp;per share of our common stock. Payment of
future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of
directors and depends upon our financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors that our board
of directors considers relevant. In particular, we are a holding
company and our operations are conducted through our
subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on our
common stock depends on the earnings and cash flow of our
subsidiaries and the availability of these cash flows to us in
the form of dividends, interest payments and loans. Payment of
dividends by our life insurance subsidiaries is subject to
strict regulatory restrictions. See &#147;Risk
Factors&nbsp;&#151; Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and
Operations&nbsp;&#151; Payment of dividends by our life
insurance subsidiaries to us is regulated by state insurance
laws&#148;.

<FONT size="2">In addition, under the terms of our revolving
credit agreement, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends
on our capital stock in excess of an amount equal to 3% of our
consolidated net worth as of December&nbsp;31 of the preceding
fiscal year. Accordingly, we would be permitted by our existing
revolving credit agreement to pay a cash dividend up to
approximately $39.8&nbsp;million in 2004.

<FONT size="2">The terms of certain capital securities issued by
our subsidiary trusts also prohibit us from declaring or paying
any dividends (other than dividends consisting of stock of the
same class as that on which such dividends are being paid) on
our capital stock during any period for which we elect to defer
interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures. We also
cannot pay any dividends on our capital stock until all accrued
interest on these capital securities is paid. The terms of the
OCEANs permit us to defer the payment of Stated Interest for a
period of up to five years. We will not be permitted to pay
dividends on our capital stock during any period in which we
elect to defer payment of Stated Interest on the OCEANs.

Tendering Existing OCEANs</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We are offering, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this offering circular and the
accompanying letter of transmittal, to exchange $1,000 original
principal amount of New OCEANs and an exchange fee of $2.50 for
each $1,000 original principal amount of validly tendered and
accepted Existing OCEANs. We are offering to exchange all of the
Existing OCEANs. However, the exchange offer is subject to the
conditions described in this offering circular.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">You may tender all, some or none of your Existing
OCEANs, subject to the terms and conditions of the exchange
offer. Holders of Existing OCEANs must tender their Existing
OCEANs in a minimum $1,000 original principal amount and
multiples thereof.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The exchange offer is not being made to, and we
will not accept tenders for exchange from, holders of Existing
OCEANs in any jurisdiction in which the exchange offer or the
acceptance of the offer would not be in compliance with the
securities or blue sky laws of that jurisdiction.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our board of directors and officers do not make
any recommendation to the holders of Existing OCEANs as to
whether or not to exchange all or any portion of their Existing
OCEANs. In addition, we have not authorized anyone to make any
recommendation. You must make your own decision whether to
tender your Existing OCEANs for exchange and, if so, the amount
of Existing OCEANs to tender.

<I><FONT size="2">Tender of Existing OCEANs Held Through

DTC participant through which the beneficial owner&#146;s
Existing OCEANs are held in DTC, to tender on such beneficial
owner&#146;s behalf. To effectively tender Existing OCEANs that
are held through DTC, DTC participants should transmit their
acceptance through the Automated Tender Offer Program, or ATOP,
for which the transaction will be eligible, and DTC will then
edit and verify the acceptance and send an agent&#146;s message
to the exchange agent for its acceptance. Delivery of tendered
Existing OCEANs must be made to the exchange agent pursuant to
the book-entry delivery procedures set forth below or the
tendering DTC participant must comply with the guaranteed
delivery procedures set forth below. No letters of transmittal
will be required to tender Existing OCEANs through ATOP.

<FONT size="2">Your Existing OCEANs must be tendered by
book-entry transfer. The exchange agent will establish an
account with respect to the Existing OCEANs at DTC for purposes
of the exchange offer within two business days after the date of
this offering circular. Any financial institution that is a
participant in DTC must make book-entry delivery of Existing
OCEANs by having DTC transfer such Existing OCEANs into the
exchange agent&#146;s relevant account at DTC in accordance with
DTC&#146;s procedures for transfer. Although your Existing
OCEANs will be tendered through the DTC facility, the letter of
transmittal, or facsimile, or an electronic confirmation
pursuant to DTC&#146;s ATOP system, with any required signature
guarantees and any other required documents, if any, must be
transmitted to and received or confirmed by the exchange agent
at its address set forth below under &#147;&#151;&nbsp;Exchange
Agent&#148;, prior to 9:00&nbsp;a.m., New York City time, on the
expiration date of the exchange offer. You or your broker must
ensure that the exchange agent receives an agent&#146;s message
from DTC confirming the book-entry transfer of your Existing
OCEANs. An agent&#146;s message is a message transmitted by DTC
and received by the exchange agent that forms a part of the
book-entry confirmation which states that DTC has received an
express acknowledgement from the participant in DTC tendering
Existing OCEANs that such participant agrees to be bound by the
terms of the letter of transmittal. Delivery of documents to DTC
in accordance with its procedures does not constitute delivery
to the exchange agent.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

in DTC&#146;s book-entry transfer facility, you should follow
the same procedures that are applicable to persons holding

any and all tenders of any particular Existing OCEANs not
properly tendered or to not accept any particular Existing

absolute right to waive any defects or irregularities in the

irregularities in connection with tenders of Existing OCEANs for
exchange must be cured within such reasonable period of time as
we shall determine. Neither we, the exchange agent, the

<FONT size="2">The new Optionally Convertible Equity-Linked
Accreting Notes (OCEANs<SUP>SM</SUP>) (the &#147;New
OCEANs&#148;) will be issued under an Indenture (the
&#147;Indenture&#148;), between us and BNY Midwest Trust
Company, as Trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). A copy of the
Indenture may be obtained from us upon written request. The
statements under this caption relating to the Indenture and the
New OCEANs are summaries and do not purport to be complete.
These summaries use a number of terms that are defined in the
Indenture and these summaries are qualified in their entirety by
express reference to the Indenture. The terms of the New OCEANs
also include those made a part of the Indenture by reference to
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. For purposes of this section,
the terms &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;our&#148; and
&#147;AmerUs&#148; mean only AmerUs Group Co. and not its
subsidiaries.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We will issue up to an aggregate accreted value
of New OCEANs equal to the aggregate accreted value of the
Existing OCEANs. The New OCEANs will have an original principal
amount of $1,000.00&nbsp;per New OCEAN, and will have a
principal amount at maturity of $1,270&nbsp;per New OCEAN. The
New OCEANs will be our general unsecured senior subordinated
obligations. The New OCEANs will mature on March&nbsp;6, 2032.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The yield on the New OCEANs (without taking into
account any Contingent Interest) will be approximately
3.83%&nbsp;per annum (based on a $1,000 original principal
amount), compounded semiannually, through March&nbsp;6, 2007,
and approximately 2.28%&nbsp;per annum compounded semiannually
from March&nbsp;6, 2007 through maturity. We will pay a portion
of the yield as cash interest semiannually on each March 6 and
September&nbsp;6, commencing March&nbsp;6, 2005 (each an
&#147;Interest Payment Date&#148;) at a rate of 2.00%&nbsp;per
annum of the original principal amount of the New OCEANs (or
$20.00&nbsp;per annum per $1,000 original principal amount of
New OCEANs) to the registered holders of record on the preceding
February&nbsp;20 and August&nbsp;23 (each a &#147;Record
Date&#148;). We call this cash interest the &#147;Stated
Interest&#148;. Stated Interest will accrue from the last
interest payment date on which Stated Interest was paid on the
New OCEANs, or, if no Stated Interest has been paid on the New
OCEANs, from the last interest payment date on which Stated
Interest was paid on the Existing OCEANs which were exchanged.
Holders whose Existing OCEANs are accepted for exchange will be
deemed to have waived the right to receive any accrued and
unpaid Stated Interest on the Existing OCEANs, but will receive
amounts equal to such accrued and unpaid Stated Interest in
accordance with the preceding sentence.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Also, holders whose Existing OCEANs are accepted
for exchange will be deemed to have waived the right to receive
the accreted value in excess of the original principal amount of
their Existing OCEANs; however, New OCEANs received upon
exchange of their Existing OCEANS will include accreted value
equal to such accreted value. We will also pay Contingent
Interest on the New OCEANs as described below under
&#147;&#151;&nbsp;Contingent Interest&#148;. Interest will be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">As described below, the principal amount of the
New OCEANs will increase on each Interest Payment Date at a rate
per annum equal to the applicable yield on the New OCEANs less
the Stated Interest to be paid on such Interest Payment Date,
whether or not such Stated Interest is deferred as described
below. Between Interest Payment Dates, the Accreted Principal
Amount will be the linear interpolation of the Accreted
Principal Amounts as of the immediately preceding and
immediately succeeding Interest Payment Dates as set forth in
the following paragraph.

<FONT size="2">In the event that we distribute shares of capital
stock of a subsidiary of ours pursuant to any event described in
clause&nbsp;(d) of the preceding paragraph, the conversion price
will be adjusted based on the market value of the subsidiary
stock so distributed relative to the market value of our common
stock, in each case over a measurement period following the
distribution. If we adopt a new shareholder rights plan, we will
be required under the Indenture to provide that holders of the
New OCEANs will receive the rights upon conversion of the New
OCEANs, whether or not these rights were separate from our
common stock prior to conversion, subject to certain limited
exceptions.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">No adjustment in the conversion price will be
required unless such adjustment would require a change of at
least 1% in the applicable conversion price; provided that any
adjustment that would otherwise be required to be made shall be
carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment. Except as stated above, the conversion price will
not be adjusted for the issuance of our common stock or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock
or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing. No
adjustment will be made if holders of the New OCEANs may
participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to
such adjustment without conversion. The Indenture will permit us
to decrease the conversion price from time to time for a period
of at least 20&nbsp;days.

<FONT size="2">If we are a party to a Merger Transaction, then

OCEAN into, or the right to receive, as applicable, such cash,
securities and other property in accordance with the provisions
described above under &#147;&#151;&nbsp;Payment Upon
Conversion&#148;. This change could substantially lessen or
eliminate the value of the conversion privilege associated with
the New OCEANs in the future. For example, if we were acquired
in a cash merger, each New OCEAN would become convertible solely
into cash and would no longer be convertible into securities
whose value would vary depending on our future prospects and
other factors.

denominations of $1,000 original principal amount of New OCEANs

delivered a Change of Control Purchase Notice (as described
below under &#147;&#151;&nbsp;Repurchase at Option of Holder
upon a Change of Control&#148;) with respect to any New OCEAN,
then, the holder may not surrender such New OCEAN for conversion
until the holder has withdrawn such notice in accordance with

surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the
second business day preceding the date fixed for redemption,
unless we default in payment of the redemption price.

<FONT size="2">The right of conversion attaching to any New
OCEAN may be exercised (a)&nbsp;if such New OCEAN is represented
by a global security, by book-entry transfer to the conversion
agent through the facilities of DTC, or (b)&nbsp;if such New
OCEAN is represented by a definitive New OCEAN, by delivery of
such New OCEAN at the specified office of the conversion agent,
accompanied, in either case, by a duly signed and completed
notice of conversion and appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents if required by the conversion agent. A holder
delivering a New OCEAN for conversion will be required to pay
any taxes or duties payable in respect of the issue or delivery
of our common stock upon conversion in a name other than that of
the holder. In addition, if a holder surrenders New OCEANs for
conversion after a Record Date and prior to the corresponding
Interest Payment Date, the holder will be required to pay the
Stated Interest payable on such New OCEANs on such Interest
Payment Date. The conversion date shall be the business day on
which the New OCEAN and all of the items required for conversion
shall have been so delivered and the other requirements for
conversion (including the payment of all applicable taxes and

the holder of such New OCEANs would receive upon conversion. If
the designated institution agrees to accept any such New OCEANs,
it will deliver the requisite shares of our common stock, if
any, cash and any other consideration, if any, to the conversion
agent as soon as practicable but in no event later than three
trading days following the Conversion Period and the conversion

OCEANs will be converted in accordance with the section
described above under &#147;Payment Upon Conversion&#148;. If
the designated institution agrees to accept any New OCEANs for

any, cash and other consideration, if any, within three trading

convert such New OCEANs and deliver to the holder such number of
shares of our common stock, if any, such cash payment and other
consideration, if any, as would have been delivered if the
designated institution had declined to accept the New OCEANs for
exchange. Any New OCEANs accepted for exchange by the designated
institution will remain outstanding.

a director to which the director is not entitled; (b)&nbsp;an
intentional infliction of harm on the Corporation or the

reason of the fact that (a)&nbsp;he or she is or was, or has

<FONT size="2">Our by-laws provide that the number of directors
be determined by our board, provided that the number is not
fewer than seven nor more than twenty-one. A majority of our
entire board of directors constitutes a quorum for the
transaction of business and the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors present at any meeting constitutes the act of
the board of directors. Our articles of incorporation and
by-laws provide for a classified board of directors consisting
of three classes as nearly equal in size as the then authorized
number of directors constituting our board permits. At each
annual meeting of our stockholders, one class of directors is
elected for a three-year term, and the directors in the other
two classes continue in office. Each class holds office until
the date of the third annual meeting for the election of
directors following the annual meeting at which such class was
elected. As a result, approximately one-third of our board is
elected each year and at least two annual meetings are normally
required to effect a change in the composition of a majority of
our board of directors. In addition, a majority of our board
constituting less than a quorum, or a sole remaining director,
may fill vacancies on our board. Together, these provisions may
preclude a stockholder from removing incumbent directors without
cause and simultaneously gaining control of the board of
directors by filling the vacancies created by such removal with
its own nominees.

<FONT size="2">Other than as specified by our articles of
incorporation or by-laws, our board of directors may amend or
repeal our by-laws and a majority of the holders of outstanding

Iowa law, certain proposed amendments to our articles of
incorporation which adversely affect the rights of a particular
class of stock must be approved by a majority of such class.

<FONT size="2">Any merger or any acquisition of our company or
more than ten percent of our voting stock is subject to
regulatory approval by the Iowa, Indiana, New York and Kansas
insurance commissioners. The Iowa Business Corporation Act
provides that, in considering acquisition proposals, our
directors may consider the effect of the proposed acquisition on
our employees, suppliers, creditors, customers, the communities
in which we operate and other community interest factors. Our
directors may reach a reasonable determination that such factors
outweigh the financial or other benefits to us or our
stockholders without violating the business judgment rule. The
Iowa Business Corporation Act also permits our board of
directors to adopt certain &#147;poison pill&#148; measures to
impede an attempt to acquire control of our company. Such
measures may include the issuance of stock rights or options
that preclude or limit the exercise or transfer of stock rights
by persons owning or acquiring a specified percentage of our
outstanding shares. On or prior to September&nbsp;20, 2005, Iowa
insurance laws require potential acquirors of more than five
percent of our voting stock to obtain the prior approval of the
Iowa Insurance Commissioner and our board for such acquisition.
Each five percent or more holder of our common stock is required
to obtain the prior approval of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner
and our board for any additional acquisition of our voting
stock. In addition, the Iowa Business Corporation Act also
imposes a three-year moratorium on business combinations between
our company and any person owning ten percent or more of our
outstanding voting stock unless (a)&nbsp;the transaction in
which the stockholder became a ten percent or more stockholder
was approved in advance by our board, (b)&nbsp;after becoming a
ten percent or more stockholder, the stockholder owned at least
85% of our outstanding voting stock not owned by our directors,
officers and employee stock plans, or (c)&nbsp;at or after the
time the stockholder became a ten percent or more stockholder,
the business combination is approved by our board and authorized
by the holders of two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock not
held by the ten percent or more stockholder. The foregoing
provisions of state law could have the effect of delaying,
deterring or preventing attempts to effect the consummation of a
change in control of our company.

tax-exempt entities, persons holding New OCEANs in a
tax-deferred or tax-advantaged account, or persons holding New

of the terms of a debt instrument or an actual exchange of an
existing debt instrument for a new debt instrument, will be
treated as an exchange of the existing debt instrument for a new
debt instrument for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes if
there is deemed to be a &#147;significant modification&#148; of
the terms of the existing debt instrument as determined for
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. It is not entirely clear
whether the exchange of the Existing OCEANs for the New OCEANs
and the payment of the exchange fee will be treated as a
significant modification of the terms of the Existing OCEANs for
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. The exchange, including
the payment of the exchange fee, will be a significant
modification of the terms of the Existing OCEANs if, based on
all facts and circumstances, the legal rights or obligations
that are altered and the degree to which they are altered are
economically significant. We intend to take the position that
the exchange of Existing OCEANs for New OCEANs and the payment
of the exchange fee will not constitute an exchange for
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes because we believe that
the differences between the terms of the Existing OCEANs and the
New OCEANs and the payment of the exchange fee are not
economically significant and, as a result, do not constitute a
significant modification of the terms of the Existing OCEANs. By
participating in the exchange offer, each holder will be deemed
to have agreed pursuant to the Indenture governing the New
OCEANs to treat the exchange as not constituting a significant
modification of the terms of the Existing OCEANs. There can be
no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree that the exchange
of Existing OCEANs for New OCEANs does not constitute a
significant modification of the terms of the Existing OCEANs.

<FONT size="2">We believe the comparable yield of the New OCEANs
should be the comparable yield of the Existing OCEANs. The
proper method for calculating the comparable yield under CPDI
regulations is not entirely clear. We calculated the comparable
yield of the Existing OCEANs as the annual yield we would pay,
as of the initial issue date, on a fixed-rate, non-convertible
debt security with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise comparable to those of the Existing OCEANs.
On the basis of that calculation, we took the position that the
comparable yield for the Existing OCEANs is 9.917%, compounded
semiannually. If the IRS successfully challenged the comparable
yield, the redetermined yield could be materially greater or
less than the comparable yield provided by us. Moreover, the
projected payment schedule (as defined below) could differ
materially from the projected payment schedule provided by us.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The CPDI regulations require that we provide to
U.S.&nbsp;Holders, solely for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax
purposes, a schedule of the projected amounts of payments, which
we refer to as the &#147;projected payment schedule&#148;, on
the New OCEANs. We prepared a projected payment schedule for the
Existing OCEANs which represents a series of payments the amount
and timing of which produce a yield to maturity equal to the
comparable yield. The projected payment schedule we prepared for
the Existing OCEANs will continue to apply to the New OCEANs.
The comparable yield and the schedule of projected payments will
