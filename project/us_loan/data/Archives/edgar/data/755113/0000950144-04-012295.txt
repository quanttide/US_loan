<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;15, 2004, Orion HealthCorp, Inc. (formerly SurgiCare,
Inc., &#147;SurgiCare&#148;) (&#147;Orion&#148; or the
&#147;Company&#148;) consummated its previously-disclosed restructuring transactions (the &#147;Closing&#148;), which
included issuances of new equity securities for cash and contribution of outstanding debt, the
acquisition of three new businesses and the restructuring of its debt facilities. The Company also
completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split, created three new classes of common stock and changed
its name. SurgiCare common stock has been converted to Orion Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The Company
also created Class&nbsp;B and Class&nbsp;C Common Stock, which was issued in connection with the equity
investments and acquisitions. SurgiCare shareholders of record will be notified regarding
exchanging their SurgiCare stock certificates for those of Orion. These transactions, as well as
other related matters, were previously described in SurgiCare&#146;s proxy statement dated September&nbsp;10,
2004 (the &#147;Proxy Statement&#148;), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. References to the
Proxy Statement contained in this current report are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the full text of the Proxy Statement (see Exhibit 20.1 to this
current report).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>The Acquisitions</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Acquisition of Integrated Physician Solutions, Inc.</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the acquisition by Orion of Integrated Physician Solutions, Inc. (&#147;IPS&#148;) by
merging a newly-formed SurgiCare subsidiary with and into IPS, IPS equityholders and certain IPS
debtholders received an aggregate of 4,470,654 shares of Orion Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. This number
approximately equals the total number of shares of Orion Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis prior to closing the IPS acquisition and the other transactions consummated at
the Closing. This acquisition was consummated on substantially the same terms described in the
Proxy Statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Acquisition of Dennis Cain Physician Solutions, Ltd. and Medical Billing Services,
Inc.</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion also acquired Dennis Cain Physician Solutions, Ltd. (&#147;DCPS&#148;), and Medical Billing
Services, Inc. (&#147;MBS&#148;). The Company acquired MBS by merging a newly-formed SurgiCare subsidiary
with and into MBS, with MBS as the surviving corporation. As a consequence of the merger, MBS
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orion. DCPS was acquired by the contribution of the units of
limited partnership interest in DCPS to Orion, and the limited liability company interests of the
limited liability company that is the general partner of DCPS were also contributed to Orion.
Immediately following the Closing, the interests in DCPS and its general partner were transferred
to MBS. These acquisitions occurred on substantially the same terms described in the Proxy
Statement, except that pursuant to the terms of the Second Amendment to Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, among SurgiCare, DCPS/MBS Acquisition, Inc., Dennis Cain
Physician Solutions, Ltd., Medical Billing Services, Inc., and the sellers party thereto (the
&#147;<U>Second Amendment to DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement</U>&#148;) the MBS sellers took $500,000 in
promissory notes in lieu of the same amount of cash which was otherwise payable at the Closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders
of MBS common stock and DCPS limited partnership interests received an aggregate of $3,000,000
in cash, promissory notes of Orion in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 and 1,575,760
shares of Class&nbsp;C Common Stock. The purchase price is subject to retroactive increase (including
issuance of up to 450,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock) or decrease based on the financial
results of the newly-formed company and its predecessors in 2004 and 2005. The terms of such
increase or decrease were modified by the Second Amendment to
DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement. Such modifications included changing (a) the
EBITDA target for the retroactive increase or decrease from
$1.6&nbsp;million for each of the fiscal years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and December&nbsp;31, 2005 to an aggregate of
$2&nbsp;million for both fiscal years, (b)&nbsp;the payment date
for all retroactive increases and decreases until after final
determination of the EBITDA for the fiscal year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, and (c)&nbsp;the payments to or from the MBS
sellers in the event of a retroactive increase, or decrease,
respectively, to reflect the change in form of the initial
consideration paid to the MBS Sellers. In
addition, 75,758 shares of SurgiCare&#146;s Class&nbsp;A

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Common Stock were reserved for issuance at the direction of
the sellers of the DCPS and MBS
equity, and the MBS and DCPS equityholders may receive other payments as described in the Proxy
Statement. Such 75,758 shares are included as outstanding for purposes of reporting ownership
percentages herein. As previously disclosed in the Proxy Statement, the shares of Class&nbsp;C Common
Stock are convertible into shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The description of the terms of the
Second Amendment to DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement contained in the foregoing is a summary and does not
purport to be complete. Such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Second Amendment to DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.1.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>The Equity Financing &#150; Issuance of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock Convertible Into Class&nbsp;A Common Stock</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion issued 11,482,261
shares of its Class&nbsp;B Common Stock to various investors for
$13,200,000 in cash plus cash in the amount of $128,350, which amount equaled the accrued but
unpaid interest immediately prior to the Closing owed to a subsidiary of Brantley Partners IV, L.P.
(&#147;Brantley IV&#148;) by SurgiCare and IPS on amounts advanced prior to October&nbsp;24, 2003 (the &#147;Base
Bridge Interest Amount&#148;). The $13,328,350 of cash proceeds represented an increase of
approximately $3,200,000 over the aggregate sale price previously
disclosed in the Proxy Statement
for the same number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, and therefore represented additional cash
proceeds to the Company. At the Closing, Orion used $5,908,761 to pay
off the debt owed to the subsidiary of Brantley IV.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement described in the Proxy Statement, Brantley IV or its
assignees agreed to subscribe for and purchase from SurgiCare the 11,482,261 shares in
consideration for $10,000,000 plus the Base Bridge Interest Amount. In connection with
consummation of the transactions, Brantley IV entered into a Supplemental Stock Subscription
Agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, by and among SurgiCare, Brantley IV and each of the
investors listed on Schedule&nbsp;I thereto, who are affiliates of Brantley IV (the &#147;Supplemental Stock
Subscription Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which such investors acquired $1,000,000 worth of the Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock which Brantley IV had agreed to purchase pursuant to the Stock Subscription Agreement
and Brantley IV agreed to assign its right to acquire such shares. Accordingly, Brantley IV&#146;s
potential ownership was decreased by the number of shares valued at $1,000,000, after taking into
account the additional investment pursuant to the Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock
Subscription Agreement described below, or 861,491 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, which initially
represented, on an as-converted basis, 3.31% of Orion&#146;s outstanding equity after the Closing. The
description of the terms of the Supplemental Stock Subscription Agreement contained in the
foregoing is a summary and does not purport to be complete. Such description is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the Supplemental Stock Subscription Agreement, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Brantley IV entered

Agreement (the &#147;Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock Subscription Agreement&#148;), dated as of
December&nbsp;15, 2004, by and among SurgiCare, Brantley IV and each of the investors listed on Schedule
I thereto (the &#147;Additional
Investors&#148;), which include Brantley Capital Corporation (&#147;Brantley Capital&#148;), pursuant to which such investors purchased a portion of the shares of the Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock for which Brantley IV had subscribed in consideration for an aggregate investment of
$3,200,000, which was in addition to the Brantley IV purchase price of $10&nbsp;million plus the Base
Bridge Interest Amount. The 2,756,774 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock issued to the Additional
Investors was deducted from the total number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock which were to be
issued to Brantley IV under the Stock Subscription Agreement. Each investor received its pro rata
portion of the total number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. Accordingly, the investment by the
Additional Investors did not change the total number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock issued
pursuant to the Stock Subscription Agreement. However, the investment by the Additional Investors
did increase the total purchase price, and the purchase price per share, for the shares of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock issued under the Stock Subscription Agreement. The increase in purchase price will
result in an increase in the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. The description of the terms of the Second Amendment and

among Orion, certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries, and Healthcare Business Credit Corporation
(&#147;HBCC&#148;). Under this facility, up to $4,000,000 of loans may be made available to Orion, subject
to a borrowing base. Orion borrowed $1,600,000 under this facility concurrently with the Closing.
The interest rate under this facility is the prime rate plus 3%. Upon
an event of default, HBCC can accelerate the loans or call the
Guarantees described below. In connection with entering into this new facility, Orion also restructured its previously-existing
debt facilities. Orion restructured such debt facilities on
substantially the same terms described in the Proxy Statement, which
resulted in a decrease in aggregate debt owed to DVI Business Credit
Corp. and DVI Financial Services, Inc. from approximately
$10.1&nbsp;million to a combined principal amount of approximately
$6.5&nbsp;million of which approximately $2&nbsp;million was paid at

exercise price of $0.01 per share, to Brantley IV and Brantley Capital in consideration for a

to the Guaranty Agreement (the &#147;Brantley IV Guaranty&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, provided by
Brantley IV to HBCC, Brantley IV agreed to provide a deficiency guarantee in the amount of

run the IPS business of Orion following the Closing. He has entered into an employment agreement
with Orion and has become the Chief Executive Officer of Orion, reporting to its board of

approximately 2.72% of Orion&#146;s outstanding equity after the Closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion has entered into agreements to employ Messrs.&nbsp;LeBlanc, Bauer, Murdock, Cain and Smith in
the capacities described above. The initial term of each employment agreement is five years. The
employment agreements provide that Orion may pay bonuses to the executives upon the attainment of
objectives determined by the board of directors. By entering into these employment agreements, the
executives agree not to disclose confidential information or engage in an activity that interferes
with Orion until the second anniversary of (i)&nbsp;the end of the executive&#146;s employment agreement or
(ii)&nbsp;termination of the executive&#146;s employment (&#147;Non-Competition Period&#148;). If an executive&#146;s
employment is terminated without cause, the agreements provide for continuation of the executive&#146;s
base salary until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period and a minimum bonus of 50% of the
average of the bonus payments made to the executive in the two years immediately preceding the
termination. All options would also vest at that time. Orion&#146;s base annual salary commitments
under the employment agreements are as follows: $240,000 to each of Keith G. LeBlanc and Terrence
L. Bauer; and $175,000 to each of Stephen H. Murdock, Dennis Cain and Tom M. Smith. The

their resignation effective as of the Closing, made an investment in the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock as
Additional Investors and are party to the Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock Subscription
Agreement. Dr.&nbsp;Penso received 86,149 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock in consideration for his
investment of $100,000, and a limited liability company controlled by Dr.&nbsp;Mineo and his wife

Brantley Partners, a private equity firm with offices in Ohio and California. Since the firm&#146;s
inception in 1987, it has been a lead investor in over 40 privately held companies in a variety of
manufacturing, technology and service industries throughout the United States. Brantley Partners
and its affiliates have approximately $300&nbsp;million of committed capital under management.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brantley Capital and Brantley III each held debt of IPS and are party to the Debt Exchange
Agreement. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreement, Brantley Capital and Brantley III received
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock with a fair market value (based on the daily average of the high and low price
per share of SurgiCare common stock over the five trading days immediately prior to the Closing)
equal to the amount owing to it under its loan to IPS in exchange for contribution of such debt to
Orion. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreement, Brantley Capital also received Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock with a fair market value (based on the daily average of the high and low price per share of
SurgiCare common stock over the five trading days immediately prior to the Closing) equal to the
amount of certain accrued dividends owed to it by IPS in exchange for the contribution of such
indebtedness, provided that the amount of shares received in respect of such dividends was subject
to reduction to the extent necessary to achieve the guaranteed allocation of shares of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock to the holders of IPS common stock and Series&nbsp;B Convertible preferred stock pursuant
to the IPS Merger Agreement. The aggregate amount of debt exchanged by the parties to the Debt
Exchange Agreement was $4,375,229, which included accrued interest as of the Closing, and $593,100
of debt in respect of accrued dividends.

$6,705,037, and received 2,312,081 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock pursuant to the IPS Merger
Agreement. Such shares were intended to approximate the value of such liquidation preference, but
were subject to reduction to the extent necessary to achieve the guaranteed allocation to holders
of certain classes of IPS common stock discussed above.

permitted transferees, holding at least 50&nbsp;percent of the Registrable Shares have the right to
request that Orion effect the registration on Form S-1 of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock having an
anticipated net aggregate offering price of at least $5,000,000. Orion is not required to effect
any such registration within six months after the effective date of any such registration
statement. Additionally, at any time Orion is eligible to file a registration statement on Form
S-3, Brantley IV, and/or its permitted transferees, may request that Orion effect the registration
on Form S-3 of Registrable Shares having an anticipated net aggregate offering price of at least
$500,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time Orion otherwise proposes to register any of its equity securities under the
Securities Act, Brantley IV and its co-investors and/or their permitted transferees may request the
registration of Registrable Shares. However, Orion is not obligated to effect any registration of
shares incidental to the registration of Orion Securities in connection with a Form S-8 or a Form

Common Stock issuable upon conversion of its shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. Initially, this will
be approximately 16,033,984 shares but, assuming everything else remains the same, the number of
shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock as to which Brantley IV and its co-investors have registration
rights will continually increase, since the conversion factor for the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock is
designed to yield additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or portions thereof, necessary to
approximate the unpaid portion of the return of the original purchase price for the Class&nbsp;B Common
Stock, including the additional investment by the Additional Investors, less the Base Bridge
Interest Amount, plus an amount equal to nine percent (9%) per annum on the amount of the original
purchase price from time to time outstanding less the Base Bridge Interest Amount, without
compounding, from the date the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock was first issued to the date of conversion.
Brantley IV and its co-investors and their permitted transferees will also have registration rights
for any additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (including Class&nbsp;A Common Stock into which other
securities of Orion are convertible) issued to them. The third-party beneficiaries will have
registration rights for one year with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately 6,122,172
shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. If the registration rights are exercised and the underlying shares

International Corporate Holdings, Ltd. v. SurgiCare, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York. Subsequently, SurgiCare filed suit against A.I. International
Corporate Holdings, Ltd. and First National Bank, S.A.L. of Lebanon in the 215<SUP>th</SUP>
Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The New York case involved allegations that
SurgiCare defaulted on its loan agreement. The plaintiffs in the New York case sued SurgiCare for
$834,252 representing the loan amount and interest, plus $219,000, representing damages for
&#147;No-filing Charges&#148; and &#147;Non-Effective Charges&#148; under the contract. SurgiCare&#146;s lawsuit in Texas
asserted that the loan agreement was usurious. The parties reached an agreement to settle this
matter which will close upon the full and complete execution of the Stipulation of Settlement by
all parties and after the consummation of the transactions described in the Proxy Statement.
Pursuant to this settlement, SurgiCare paid the plaintiffs $220,000 in cash at the Closing and
issued 210,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock.

         2.5. Amendment to Section 2.07(c). Section 2.07(c) is hereby amended to
read in its entirety as follows:

                           "(c) Additional Acquisition Consideration. The
         Sellers may be eligible to receive additional Acquisition Consideration
         consisting of an aggregate of up to a maximum of $1,125,000 in cash and
         up to a maximum number of SurgiCare Class A Common Shares equal to
         4,500,000 multiplied by the Reverse Split Fraction, as set forth in
         this Section 2.07(c) and subject to Section 2.07(e).

                                    (i) With respect to the years ended December
                  31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, if the aggregate amount of the
                  Newco EBITDA for such years is greater than $2,000,000 (any
                  such amounts in excess of $2,000,000 being referred to herein
                  as the "Newco EBITDA Excess"):

                                    A. the MBS Cash Consideration shall be
                           increased by an amount equal to the product of 25%
                           multiplied by the Newco EBITDA Excess; provided,
                           however, in no event shall the MBS Cash Consideration
                           be increased by more than an aggregate of $562,500
                           pursuant to this Section 2.07(c)(i)(A);

                                    B. the DCPS Cash Consideration shall be
                           increased by an amount equal to the product of 25%
                           multiplied by the Newco EBITDA Excess; provided,
                           however, in no event shall the DCPS Cash
                           Consideration be increased by more than an aggregate
                           of $562,500 pursuant to this Section 2.07(c)(i)(B);

                                    C. the MBS Share Consideration shall be
                           increased by an amount of SurgiCare Class A Common
                           Shares equal to the product of 75% multiplied by a
                           fraction, the numerator of which is the Newco EBITDA
                           Excess, and the denominator of which is the quotient
                           of (1) $0.75 divided by (2) the Reverse Split
                           Fraction; provided, however, in no event shall the
                           MBS Share Consideration be increased pursuant to this
                           Section 2.07(c)(i)(C) by more than an aggregate
                           number of SurgiCare Class A Common Shares equal to
                           the product of (x) 2,250,000 multiplied by (y) the
                           Reverse Split Fraction; and

                                    D. the DCPS Share Consideration shall be
                           increased by an amount of SurgiCare Class A Common
                           Shares equal to the product of 75% multiplied by a
                           fraction, the numerator of which is the Newco EBITDA
                           Excess, and the denominator of which is the quotient
                           of (1) $0.75 divided by (2) the Reverse Split
                           Fraction; provided, however, in no event shall the
                           DCPS Share Consideration be increased pursuant to
                           this Section 2.07(c)(i)(D) by more than an aggregate
                           number of SurgiCare Class A Common Shares equal to
                           the product of (x) 2,250,000 multiplied by (y) the
                           Reverse Split Fraction.

                                    (ii) Any increase to the MBS Cash
                  Consideration or the DCPS Cash Consideration to be made under
                  this Section 2.07(c) will be paid (or caused to be paid) by
                  SurgiCare, without interest, by wire transfer of immediately
                  available

                  funds to an account or accounts designated by Smith (in the
                  case of the MBS Cash Consideration) or Cain (in the case of
                  the DCPS Cash Consideration), promptly after the final
                  determination of the amount of Newco EBITDA for the year ended
                  December 31, 2005 (whether by lack of disagreement with the
                  initial determination, resolution of any disagreement with the
                  initial determination by the parties, or resolution through
                  submission of any dispute to the Accountants), but in no event
                  later than ten days after such final determination.
                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
                  2.07(c), the right of the Sellers to receive any cash payment
                  pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.07(c) shall be subject
                  to the terms of the Subordination Agreement. If payment of all
                  or any portion of any amount due under this Section 2.07(c) is
                  not permitted by the Subordination Agreement, then interest,
                  compounded on an annual basis, will accrue on the unpaid
                  balance at the rate of 8% per annum from the date such payment
                  is due until the date such payment is made, and payment of
                  such amount (together with such interest) shall be made (or
                  caused to be made) by SurgiCare on the earliest date as of
                  which such payment may be made in compliance with the
                  Subordination Agreement. Any increase to the MBS Share
                  Consideration or the DCPS Share Consideration to be made under
                  this Section 2.07(c) will be satisfied by SurgiCare by
                  delivery to Smith (in the case of the MBS Share Consideration)
                  or Cain (in the case of the DCPS Share Consideration), of
                  certificates representing such increase to the MBS Share
                  Consideration or DCPS Share Consideration, in either case
                  promptly after the final determination of the amount of Newco
                  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 (whether by lack
                  of disagreement with the initial determination, resolution of
                  any disagreement with the initial determination by the
                  parties, or resolution through submission of any dispute to
                  the Accountants), but in no event later than ten days after
                  such final determination; provided, however, that any issuance
                  of SurgiCare Class A Common Shares to a Seller hereunder will
                  be conditioned upon SurgiCare receiving from such Seller
                  satisfactory assurances that the representations and
                  warranties set forth in Section 4.24 of this Agreement remain
                  true and correct in all respects with regards to such Seller
                  as of the date of such issuance."

         2.6. Amendment to Section 2.07(d). Section 2.07(d) is hereby amended to
read in its entirety as follows:

                           (d) Reduction of Acquisition Consideration. The
         Sellers may be required to forfeit a portion of the Acquisition
         Consideration, as set forth in this Section 2.07(d) and subject to
         Section 2.07(e).

                                    (i) With respect to the years ended December
                  31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2005, if the
                  aggregate amount of the Newco EBITDA for such years is less
                  than $2,000,000 (the amount of shortfall below $2,000,000
                  being referred to herein as the "Newco EBITDA Shortfall"):

                                    A. (1) the outstanding principal amount of
                           the MBS Notes (the "MBS Note Balance") shall be
                           reduced by an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the
                           product (the "MBS EBITDA Shortfall Amount") of 1.25
                           multiplied by the

<PAGE>

                           Newco EBITDA Shortfall and (2) the DCPS Note Balance,
                           and any interest accrued but unpaid on such reduced
                           principal amount shall be forfeited;

                                    B. the outstanding principal amount of the
                           DCPS Notes (the "DCPS Note Balance") shall be reduced
                           by an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the product
                           (the "DCPS EBITDA Shortfall Amount") of 1.25
                           multiplied by the Newco EBITDA Shortfall and (2) the
                           DCPS Note Balance, and any interest accrued but
                           unpaid on such reduced principal amount shall be
                           forfeited;

                                    C. to the extent that the MBS EBITDA
                           Shortfall Amount is greater than the MBS Note
                           Balance, upon the written election of SurgiCare, the
                           MBS Share Consideration shall be reduced by an amount
                           of SurgiCare Class C Common Shares which, if
                           converted, would represent a number of Class A Common
                           Shares equal to the quotient of (1) the difference
                           between the MBS EBITDA Shortfall Amount and the MBS
                           Note Balance divided by (2) the quotient of (a) $0.33
                           divided by (b) the Reverse Split Fraction; and

                                    D. to the extent that the DCPS EBITDA
                           Shortfall Amount is greater than the DCPS Note
                           Balance, upon the written election of SurgiCare, the
                           DCPS Share Consideration shall be reduced by an
                           amount of SurgiCare Class C Common Shares which, if
                           converted, would represent a number of Class A Common
                           Shares equal to the quotient of (1) the difference
                           between the DCPS EBITDA Shortfall Amount and the DCPS
                           Note Balance divided by (2) the quotient of (a) $0.33
                           divided by (b) the Reverse Split Fraction.

                                    (ii) Any decrease to be made under this
                  Section 2.07(d) to (A) the MBS Share Consideration will be
                  satisfied by Smith by delivery to SurgiCare of certificates
                  representing such decrease to the MBS Share Consideration,
                  endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed assignment
                  documents with a medallion signature guarantee, or (B) the
                  DCPS Share Consideration will be satisfied by Cain by delivery
                  to SurgiCare of certificates representing such decrease to the
                  DCPS Share Consideration, endorsed in blank or accompanied by
                  duly executed assignment documents with a medallion signature
                  guarantee, in either case promptly after the final
                  determination of the amount of Newco EBITDA for the year ended
                  December 31, 2005 (whether by lack of disagreement with the
                  initial determination, resolution of any disagreement with the
                  initial determination by the parties, or resolution through
                  submission of any dispute to the Accountants), but in no event
                  later than ten days after such final determination.

                                    (iii) Until such time as no decrease to the
                  Acquisition Consideration received by a Seller can be made
                  pursuant to this Section 2.07(d), including a decrease in the
                  Acquisition Consideration resulting from a sale of the
                  Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.07(e), (A) such
                  Seller will not, without the prior written consent of
                  SurgiCare, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, assign,
                  pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber, engage in a
                  Constructive Sale or otherwise dispose of in any manner any of

                  SurgiCare Class A Common Shares into which such SurgiCare
                  Class C Common Shares have been converted), or offer, consent
                  or agree to do any of the foregoing, (B) such SurgiCare Class
                  C Common Shares (or SurgiCare Class A Common Shares, if
                  applicable) shall bear a legend disclosing the existence of
                  the restrictions contained herein and (C) SurgiCare may,
                  without the consent of such Seller, deliver stop transfer
                  instructions to SurgiCare's transfer agent with respect to
                  such SurgiCare Class C Common Shares (or SurgiCare Class A
                  Common Shares, if applicable)."

         2.7. Amendment to Section 2.07(e). Section 2.07(e) is hereby amended to
read in its entirety as follows:

                           (e) Effect of Termination Without Cause or Sale of
         the Surviving Corporation. Sections 2.07(c) and 2.07(d) are subject to
         the following provisions in the event that (1) SurgiCare sells (a
         "Newco Sale Event") all of the capital stock, or all or substantially
         all of the assets, of the Surviving Corporation to an unaffiliated
         third party (other than in connection with an acquisition of all or
         substantially all of SurgiCare and other than any sale pursuant to the
         ROFR granted by Section 6.11 hereof) or (2) the employment of Cain or
         Smith is terminated by SurgiCare without "Cause" (as defined in the
         employment agreements referenced in Section 7.02) (a "Qualifying
         Termination"), in either case prior to the second anniversary of the

                  effect with respect to Smith, the MBS Notes, if any, or the
                  MBS Share Consideration following the date of such Newco Sale
                  Event or Qualifying Termination.

                                    (ii) If a Newco Sale Event or a Qualifying
                  Termination of Cain occurs on or prior to December 31, 2005,

         2.9. Amendment to Section 3.25. Section 3.25 is hereby amended to read
in its entirety as follows:

                  "SECTION 3.25 Offering Valid. Assuming the accuracy of the
         representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section
         4.24, the offer, sale and issuance of the SurgiCare Class C Common
         Shares (and, if applicable, SurgiCare Class A Common Shares), the MBS
         Notes, if any, and the DCPS Notes in the Acquisitions will be exempt
         from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and will have
         been registered or qualified (or are exempt from registration and
         qualification) under the registration, permit or qualification
         requirements of all applicable state securities laws. Neither SurgiCare
         nor any agent on its behalf has solicited or will solicit any offers to
         sell or has offered to sell or will offer to sell all or any part of
         the SurgiCare Class C Common Shares, SurgiCare Class A Common Shares,
         MBS Notes or DCPS Notes to any Person or Persons so as to bring the
         sale of such SurgiCare Class C Common Shares, SurgiCare Class A Common
         Shares, MBS Notes or DCPS Notes by SurgiCare within the registration
         provisions of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.
         SurgiCare has made or will, in accordance with all time periods under
         applicable laws, make all requisite filings and has taken or will take
         all action necessary to be taken to comply with such state securities
         or "blue sky" laws. All prior issuances of SurgiCare's securities have
         been conducted in conformity with all applicable securities laws."

         2.10. Amendment to Section 4.24. Section 4.24 is hereby amended to read
in its entirety as follows:

                  "SECTION 4.24 Investment Representations. The Sellers have
         been advised that neither the SurgiCare Class C Common Shares (and, if
         applicable, SurgiCare Class A Common Shares) constituting the MBS Share
         Consideration and the DCPS Share Consideration, nor the MBS Notes, if
         any, nor the DCPS Notes have been registered under the Securities Act
         or any state securities laws and, therefore, such SurgiCare Class C
         Common Shares, SurgiCare Class A Common Shares, MBS Notes and DCPS
         Notes may not be resold unless they are registered under the Securities
         Act and applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from
         such registration requirements is available. The Sellers are aware that
         SurgiCare is under no obligation to effect any such registration with
         respect to such SurgiCare Class C Common Shares, SurgiCare Class A
         Common Shares, MBS Notes or DCPS Notes or to file for or comply with
         any exemption from registration. Each Seller is receiving the SurgiCare
         Class C Common Shares, SurgiCare Class A Common Shares, MBS Notes and
         DCPS Notes to be acquired by such Seller hereunder for

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

         his own account and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
         with, the distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Each
         Seller has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
         matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such
         investment, is able to incur a complete loss of such investment and is
         able to bear the economic risk of such investment for an indefinite
         period of time. Each Seller is an accredited investor as that term is
         defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act."

         2.11. Amendment to Section 9.03(a). Section 9.03(a) is hereby amended
to read in its entirety as follows:

                  "(a) "Acquisition Consideration" means the MBS Cash
         Consideration, the DCPS Cash Consideration, the MBS Share
         Consideration, the DCPS Share Consideration, the MBS Notes, if any, and
         the DCPS Notes."

         2.12. Amendment to Section 9.13. Section 9.13 is hereby amended to read
in its entirety as follows:

                  "SECTION 9.13 Set-Off. Amounts owing by any Seller to
         SurgiCare or Newco under Section 2.07 of this Agreement may, but shall
         not be required to, be set-off against any amounts owing by SurgiCare
         or Newco to the Sellers under any provision of this Agreement
         (including without limitation Section 2.07), the MBS Notes, if any, or
         the DCPS Notes."

         2.13. Amendment to Exhibit B. Exhibit B, the Form of Seller Note, is
hereby replaced in its entirety with Exhibit A hereto.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Orion HealthCorp, Inc., a Delaware

[("DCPS Seller") or ("MBS Seller"), as applicable] or registered permitted
assigns (such original payee or any such assignee from time to time, the

Noteholder shall from time to time have designated to the Company in writing, on

check in the amount thereof to the Noteholder at its address appearing in the
register maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

         Notwithstanding any provisions of this Note, in no event shall the
amount of interest paid or agreed to be paid by the Company exceed an amount
computed at the highest rate of interest permissible under applicable law.

3. PAYMENT PROVISIONS. The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes
are outstanding:

         3.1. Payment at Maturity of the Note. Subject at all times to the
Subordination Agreement, on the Maturity Date, or on any accelerated maturity of
the Notes permitted hereby and thereby, the Company will pay the entire
principal amount of this Note then outstanding, together with all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.

         3.2. Voluntary Prepayments. Subject at all times to the Subordination
Agreement, the Company may at any time and from time to time prepay all or part
of the principal amount of the Note then outstanding without penalty or premium.

         3.3. Notice of Prepayments. Notice of each voluntary prepayment of the
Note pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof shall be given in accordance with Section
9.02 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger not fewer than three days before the

to prepay specifying the date of prepayment, the aggregate amount of the Note to

date held by the Noteholder, and the accrued interest applicable to such
prepayment.

         3.4. Payment and Interest Cut-Off. Upon each prepayment of the Note, in
whole or in part, the Company will pay to the Noteholder the amount of the Note
to be prepaid, as set forth in the notice delivered pursuant to Section 3.3
hereof, together with unpaid interest in respect thereof accrued to and
including the prepayment date.

         3.5. Setoff. The Company may, at its sole option, at any time and from
time to time discharge any payment obligation under this Note by setoff against
all or any part of any payment obligation owing by the original Noteholder
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, including without limitation any
payment obligation under Section 2.07(d) thereof.

4. DEFAULTS.

         4.1. If any one or more of the following events (each such event being
an "Event of Default") shall happen, that is to say:

                  4.1.1 The Company shall fail to make any payment in respect of
principal of or interest on the Note (other than interest not so paid as a
result of the applicability of restrictions

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

contained in the Subordination Agreement) as the same shall become due whether
at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and such failure shall continue
uncured and unremedied for 15 business days after the Noteholder has provided
notice thereof to the Company; or

         4.1.2 The Company shall:

                           (a) commence a voluntary case concerning itself under
         Title 11 of the United States Code entitled "Bankruptcy" as now or
         hereafter in effect, or any successor thereto (the "Bankruptcy Code");

                           (b) have commenced against it an involuntary case
         under said Bankruptcy Code and the petition is dismissed within 60 days
         of the commencement of the case; or

                           (c) have appointed for it a custodian (as defined in
         the Bankruptcy Code) to take charge of all or substantially all of its
         property; or

                           (d) have filed against it any proceeding under any
         reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of debt, relief of debtors,
         dissolution, insolvency or liquidation or similar law of any
         jurisdiction whether now or hereafter in effect, which such proceeding
         remains undismissed for a period of 60 days or shall suffer the
         appointment of any receiver or custodian or the like for it or all or
         substantially all of its property which continues undischarged or
         unstayed for a period of 60 days; or

                           (e) make a general assignment for the benefit of its
         creditors; or

then and in each and every such case, subject to the provisions of the
Subordination Agreement, the Noteholder may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or other appropriate proceeding, and
may by notice to the Company declare (each, an "Acceleration") all or any part
of the unpaid principal amount of the Note then outstanding to be forthwith due
and payable, and thereupon such unpaid principal amount or part thereof,
together with interest accrued thereon and all other sums, if any, payable under
the Note, shall become so due and payable without presentation, presentment,
protest or further demand or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived, and such holder or holders may proceed to enforce payment of
such amount or part thereof in such manner as it or they may elect; provided,
however, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default under
Section 4.1.2, Acceleration shall be deemed automatic without notice to the
Company.

         4.2. Annulment of Defaults. An Event of Default shall not be deemed to
be in existence for any purpose of this Agreement if the Noteholder shall have
waived such event in writing or stated in writing that the same has been cured
to its reasonable satisfaction. No waiver or statement of satisfactory cure
pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall extend to or affect any subsequent or other
Event of Default not specifically identified in such waiver or statement of
satisfactory cure or impair any of the rights of any holder of the Notes upon
the occurrence thereof.

                                      -3-

                            ARTICLE 1 - STOCKHOLDERS

         1.1 Place of Meetings. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
such place, within or without the State of Delaware, or, if so determined by the
Board of Directors in its sole discretion, at no place (but rather by means of
remote communication), as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors or the President or, if not so designated, at the principal executive
office of the corporation.

         1.2 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election
of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting shall be held at such date and time as shall be fixed
by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. If no annual
meeting is held in accordance with the foregoing provisions, a special meeting
may be held in lieu of the annual meeting, and any action taken at that special
meeting shall have the same effect as if it had been taken at the annual
meeting, and in such case all references in these By-Laws to the annual meeting
of stockholders shall be deemed to refer to such special meeting.

         1.3 Special Meeting. Special meetings of stockholders may be called at
any time by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer
(or, if there is no Chief Executive Officer, the President) or by vote of a
majority of the Board of Directors. Any business transacted at any special
meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or
purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

         1.4 Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, written
notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be
given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of
the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notices of
all meetings shall state the place, if any, the date, the means of remote
communications, if any by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such meeting, and the hour of the meeting. The
notice of a special meeting shall state, in addition, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be
given either personally or by mail, electronic mail, telecopy, telegram or other
electronic or wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent
charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that
stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation. Notice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail
or at the time of transmission when sent by electronic mail, telecopy, telegram
or other electronic or wireless means. An affidavit of the mailing or other
means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the
secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving
the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice or
report.

         1.5 Voting List. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for a period of
at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, for any purpose germane to the
meeting on either a reasonably accessible electronic network (for which such
information required to access the electronic

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

network shall be provided with the notice of the meeting) or, during ordinary
business hours, at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held. If
the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept
at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time of the meeting, and
may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access
such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

         1.6 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares of the
capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at
the meeting, present in person, by means of remote communication, if authorized,
or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business.

         1.7 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to any
other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held
under these By-Laws by the stockholders present or represented at the meeting
and entitled to vote, although less than a quorum, or, if no stockholder is
present, by any officer entitled to preside at or to act as secretary of such
meeting. It shall not be necessary to notify any stockholder of any adjournment
of less than thirty (30) days if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken, unless after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the
adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting.

         1.8 Voting. Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of
capital stock entitled to vote and held of record by such stockholder, unless
otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. Each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person or by
electronic means, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion.

         Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the
shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or,
except when the matter is the election of directors, may vote them against the
proposal; but if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the
stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the
stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder
is entitled to vote.

         1.9 Proxy Representation. Every stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a stockholder
is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting
to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent
without a meeting. The delivery of a proxy on behalf of a stockholder consistent
with telephonic or electronically transmitted instructions obtained pursuant to
procedures of the corporation reasonably designed to verify that such
instructions have been authorized by such stockholder shall constitute execution
and delivery of the proxy by or on behalf of the stockholder. No proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless such proxy provides
for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may
be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled
is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.
The authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to specified action,
provided, however, that if a proxy limits its authorization to a meeting or
meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy
shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall not
be valid after the final adjournment thereof. A proxy purporting to be
authorized by or on behalf of a stockholder, if accepted by the corporation in
its discretion, shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its
exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.

         1.10 Action at Meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a
plurality of the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect the
candidate to such office and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any
question other than an election to an office shall decide the question, except
when a larger vote is required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, by
the By-Laws or by the rules or regulations of the NASD, Nasdaq or any stock
exchange applicable to the corporation. No ballot shall be required for any
election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting
and entitled to vote in the election.

         1.11 Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are nominated in
accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as
directors. The nomination for election to the Board of Directors of the
corporation at a meeting of stockholders may be made only (a) pursuant to the
notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction
of the Board of Directors, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors
or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record of
the corporation at the time the notice provided for below in this Section 1.11
is delivered to the Secretary who is entitled to vote in the election of
directors at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth
in this Section 1.11. Such nominations, other than those made by or on behalf of
the Board of Directors, shall be made by timely notice in writing delivered or
mailed to the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.12. Such
notice shall set forth (a) as to each proposed nominee (i) the name, age,
business address and, if known, residence address of each such nominee, (ii) the
principal occupation or employment of each such nominee, (iii) the number of
shares of stock of the corporation which are beneficially owned by each such
nominee, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person
or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder,
and (iv) any other information concerning the nominee that must be disclosed as
to nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), including such
person's written consent to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if
elected; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice, the information
required to be provided pursuant to Section 1.12. The corporation may require
any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be
required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed
nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.

         The chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with the provisions

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

of this Section 1.11, and if he or she should so determine, the chair shall so
declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a
nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 1.11. Nothing in this Section 1.11 shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.

         1.12 Notice of Business at Annual Meetings. At an annual meeting of the
stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly
brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting,
business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, (c) otherwise properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder who was a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the
stockholder's notice provided for below in this Section 1.12 is delivered to the
Secretary who is entitled to vote and who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 1.12. For business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, if such business relates to the election of
directors of the corporation, the procedures in Section 1.11 must be complied
with. If such business relates to any other matter, the stockholder must have
given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a
stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed by first class United States
mail, postage prepaid, and received by the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not less than ninety (90) calendar days nor more than
one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if
the annual meeting is not held within thirty (30) days before or after such
anniversary date, then for the notice by the stockholder to be timely it must be
so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
date on which the notice of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was
made, whichever occurs first. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of
the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of
the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (d) any
material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything
in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual
meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.12
and except that any stockholder proposal which complies with Rule 14a-8 of the
proxy rules, or any successor provision, promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is to be included in the corporation's
proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders shall be deemed to comply
with the requirements of this Section 1.12.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

         The chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.12, and if he or she should
so determine, the chair shall so declare to the meeting and any such business
not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present business,
such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 1.12. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.

         1.13 Action without Meeting. Stockholders may not take any action by
written consent in lieu of a meeting.

         1.14 Conduct of Meeting. The Chairman of the Board or, in his or her
absence, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief Executive Officer or
the President, in the order named, shall call meetings of the stockholders to
order and act as chair of such meeting; provided, however, that, in the absence
of the Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors may appoint any stockholder
to act as chair of any meeting. The Secretary of the corporation or, in his or
her absence, any Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of
the stockholders; provided, however, that in the absence of the Secretary at any
meeting of the stockholders, the person acting as chair at any meeting may
appoint any person to act as secretary of such meeting.

         The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to make
such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it
shall deem appropriate. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of
Directors, if any, the person presiding over the meeting shall have the right
and authority to convene and adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of the
person presiding over the meeting, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for
the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing
an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on
participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and
their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the
person presiding over the meeting shall permit, restrictions on entry to the
meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the
time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the
opening and closing of the polls for balloting and matters which are to be voted
on by ballot. The person presiding over the meeting, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter
or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if the person
presiding over the meeting should so determine and declare, any such matter or
business shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
rules of parliamentary procedure.

                             ARTICLE 2 - DIRECTORS

         2.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of the corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, who may exercise
all of the powers of the corporation except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. In the event of a vacancy in the
Board of Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by
law, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is
filled.

         2.2 Number; Election and Qualification. The number of directors which
shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be determined by resolution
of the Board of Directors, but in no event shall be less than three. The number
of directors may be decreased at any time and from time to time by a majority of
the directors then in office, but only to eliminate vacancies existing by reason
of the death, resignation, removal or expiration of the term of one or more
directors. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders
by such stockholders as have the right to vote on such election. The directors
need not be stockholders of the corporation.

         2.3 Terms of Office. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, each director shall hold
office until the next annual meeting and until his successor is elected and
qualified, or until he sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.

         2.4 Vacancies. Vacancies and any newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the number of directors may be filled by vote of the
holders of the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director at a meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the directors
then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, in
each case elected by the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect
such directors. When one or more directors shall resign from the board,
effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office,
including those who have resigned, who were elected by the particular class or
series of stock entitled to elect such resigning director or directors shall
have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote or action by writing
thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become
effective. The Board of Directors shall be deemed to be duly constituted
notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership, whether because of the
failure of the stockholders to elect the full number of directors or otherwise.
Any such vacancy shall automatically reduce the number of directors pro tanto,
until such time as such vacancy has been filled in accordance with applicable
law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws, whereupon the number of
directors shall be automatically increased pro tanto.

         2.5 Resignation and Removal. Any director may resign by delivering his

another; and all persons participating in such a meeting shall be deemed to be

so disqualified; provided, however, that in no case shall less than one-third
(1/3) of the number of the whole Board of Directors constitute a quorum. In the
absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice, other than

corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and
records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a

examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other
books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a

to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court
may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and
all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies
or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other
and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations

of such notice either in writing signed by the person entitled to such notice or
such person's duly authorized attorney, or by telegraph, cable, electronic mail
or any other available method, whether before, at or after the time stated in
such waiver, or the appearance of such person or persons at such meeting in
person, by means of remote communications, if authorized, or by proxy shall be
deemed equivalent to such notice. Where such an appearance is made for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully
called or convened, the appearance shall not be deemed equivalent to notice.

         6.4 Checks; Drafts; Evidences of Indebtedness. From time to time, the
board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may
sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or
other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the
corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those
instruments.

         6.5 Corporate Contracts and Instruments; How Executed. The board of
directors, except as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, may authorize any
officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute
any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency
power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or
authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its
credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

         6.6 Evidence of Authority. A certificate by the Secretary, or an
Assistant Secretary under Section 3.11, or a temporary secretary under Section
3.11, as to any action taken by the stockholders, directors, a committee or any
officer or representative of the corporation shall, as to all persons who rely
on the certificate in good faith, be conclusive evidence of such action.

between the corporation and one or more of the directors or officers, or between
the corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other
organization in which one or more of the directors or officers are directors or
officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for
this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the
Board of Directors which authorizes the contract or transaction or solely
because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

            (1) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and
as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee of the Board
of Directors in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the
affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the
disinterested directors be less than a quorum;

            (2) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and
as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or

            (3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of
the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a
committee of the Board of Directors, or the stockholders.

         Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee
which authorizes the contract or transaction.

         6.9 Construction; Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise,
the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the General

identity of the person or persons may require.

         6.10 Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law. All restrictions,
limitations, requirements and other provisions of these By-Laws shall be
construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions
of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with
in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be
illegal.

         6.11 Provisions Contrary to Provisions of Law; Severability. Any
article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these
By-Laws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 6.10
hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of
law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect,
but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other
portions of these By-Laws, it being hereby declared that these By-Laws would
have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence,
clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more
articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is
or are illegal.

         6.12 Notices. Any reference in these By-Laws to the time a notice is
given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written
notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the
time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is
delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the
person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any
oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless, to the
recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving
the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.

         Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these
By-Laws may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting

By-Laws or this sentence by the stockholders shall require the affirmative vote

L.P. ("Brantley") and each of the investors listed on Schedule I hereto (the

as the "Additional Subscribers" and individually as an "Additional Subscriber").

         WHEREAS, SurgiCare has previously entered into an Amended and Restated
Stock Subscription Agreement dated as of February 9, 2004 with Brantley, and the
First Amendment to Stock Subscription Agreement dated as of July 16, 2004 with
Brantley (as so amended, the "Subscription Agreement"), a conformed copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which SurgiCare agreed to
issue and sell to Brantley, and Brantley agreed to purchase, a number of shares
of Class B Common (as defined under the Subscription Agreement) set forth
therein (the "Total Subscription Shares") in exchange for an aggregate
consideration of $10,000,000 plus the Base Bridge Interest Amount (as defined in
the Subscription Agreement) (the "Brantley Purchase Price");

         WHEREAS, Brantley desires to assign to the Additional Subscribers its
right under the Subscription Agreement to purchase from SurgiCare, for an
aggregate consideration of $3,200,000 (the "Additional Aggregate Purchase
Price"), which is in addition to the Brantley Purchase Price, a portion of the
Total Subscription Shares equal to the number of Total Subscription Shares

<PAGE>

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual

                  (b) SurgiCare hereby consents to the Assignment and the
         parties agree that as of the date of this Agreement, Brantley's rights

         6. CLOSING, PAYMENT AND DELIVERY. At the Closing, each Additional
Subscriber will pay to SurgiCare, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount set forth opposite its name in the column labeled "Total
Purchase Price" on Schedule I; and SurgiCare will deliver to each Additional

extended by Lender to or for the benefit of Borrowers from time to time
hereunder in the form of revolving credit loans ("LOANS"). The aggregate
outstanding amount of all Advances, shall not at any time exceed the Borrowing
Base. In no event shall the initial principal amount of any Loan be less than
$25,000. Subject to such limitation, the outstanding balance of all Advances may
fluctuate from time to time, to be reduced by repayments made by Borrowers, to
be increased by future Advances which may be made by Lender. If the aggregate
outstanding amount of all Advances exceeds the Borrowing Base, Borrowers shall
immediately repay such excess in full. Lender has the right at any time, and
from time to time, in its reasonable discretion (but without any obligation) to
set aside reasonable reserves against the Borrowing Base in such amounts as it
may deem appropriate. The Obligations of Borrowers under

                                       11
<PAGE>

the Credit Facility and this Agreement are joint and several and shall at all
times be absolute and unconditional.

                  (b) At Closing, Borrowers shall execute and deliver a
promissory note to Lender in the principal amount of the Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000) (as may be amended, modified or replaced from time to time, the
"REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE"). The Revolving Credit Note shall evidence Borrowers
joint and several, absolute and unconditional obligation to repay Lender for all
Loans made by Lender under the Credit Facility, with interest as herein and
therein provided. Each and every Loan under the Credit Facility shall be deemed
evidenced by the Revolving Credit Note, which is deemed incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof. The Revolving Credit Note shall be
substantially in the form set forth in EXHIBIT 2.1(b) attached hereto and made a
part hereof.

                  (c) The term ("INITIAL TERM") of the Credit Facility shall
expire on December 15, 2006. All Loans shall be repaid on or before the earlier
of the last day of the Initial Term or upon termination of the Credit Facility
or termination of this Agreement ("MATURITY DATE"). After the Maturity Date no
further Loans shall be available from Lender.

                  (d) From time to time, upon not less than three (3) Business
Days notice to Borrowers, Lender may adjust the Advance Rate in order to
reflect, in Lender's reasonable judgment, the experience with Borrowers
(including by way of illustration, to adjust for any known or potential offsets
by Medicare or Medicaid) or the aggregate amount or percentage of the
Collections with respect to the Accounts.

         2.2 Funding Procedures:

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
so long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred
hereunder, Lender will make Loans to Borrowers once a week, on a specified
Business Day of each week (such day to be mutually agreeable to Borrowers and
Lender ("DESIGNATED FUNDING DATE") whether or not Borrowers have requested a
Loan to be made on such date or on such other day of the week as Borrowers may
request such day along with the Designated Funding Date are referred to herein
as the "FUNDING DATE".

                  (b) Not later than 11:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) three (3)
Business Days prior to each Designated Funding Date ("DOWNLOAD DATE"), Borrowers
will deliver to Lender the computer file data associated with the Accounts,
which shall include without limitation, the information (including changes in
the Obligor reimbursement rates and changes in federal or state laws or
regulations affecting payment for medical services) required by Lender to enable
Lender to process and value the outstanding Accounts of Borrowers on Lender's
Value Track System(TM), as well as bill and collect such Accounts following an
Event of Default ("ACCOUNTS DETAIL FILE"). Upon completion of the processing of
the data with respect to such Accounts, Lender will prepare and deliver to
Borrowers by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the first Business Day
following the Download Date (or if such Accounts Detail File is not delivered
until after 11:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the Download Date, the second Business
Day following the Download Date), a report

                                       12
<PAGE>

regarding the Borrowing Base then in effect, which shall be substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT 2.2(b) (a "BORROWING BASE REPORT").

                  (c) On the Funding Date, Borrowers will sign and return the
Borrowing Base Report to Lender. If Borrowers are requesting that a Loan be made
on such Funding Date, Borrowers shall also deliver to Lender, concurrently with
the Borrowing Base Report, a written request for such Loan substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT 2.2(c) (a "LOAN REQUEST"). The Borrowing Base Report and Loan
Request may be delivered via telecopy and Borrowers acknowledge that Lenders may
rely on Borrowers signatures by facsimile, which shall be legally binding upon
Borrowers.

                  (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if
the Borrowing Base Report (if applicable) and Loan Request are delivered to
Lender before 11:00 A.M. on the Funding Date, Lender will advance on the Funding
Date (or the next Business Day if the Borrowing Base Report and Loan Request are
delivered after 11:00 A.M. (Eastern Time)) to Borrowers a Loan in the amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the Loan requested by Borrowers in the
Loan Request, or (ii) the Borrowing Base Excess as of such date. Any Advances
made by Lender hereunder shall be treated for all purposes as, and shall accrue
interest at the same rate applicable to, Loans.

                  (e) Lender's determination of the Estimated Net Value of the
Eligible Accounts and other amounts to be determined or calculated under this
Agreement shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding and conclusive.

         2.3 Interest and Fees:

                  (a) Each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof from the date made until such Loan is paid in full, at a rate per
annum equal to the lesser of (a) the Highest Lawful Rate or (b) the Prime Rate
plus three percent (3.00%) The interest rate on all amounts outstanding under
the Credit Facility shall be adjusted weekly based on the Prime Rate as of each
Designated Funding Date.

                  (b) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
rate of interest applicable to each Loan then outstanding shall be the Default
Rate. The Default Rate shall apply from the date of the Event of Default until
the date such Event of Default is waived, and interest accruing at the Default
Rate shall be payable upon demand.

                  (c) Should the Credit Facility be terminated for any reason
prior to the last day of the Initial Term, in addition to repayment of all
Obligations then outstanding and termination of Lender's commitment hereunder,
Borrowers shall unconditionally be obligated to pay at the time of such
termination, a fee ("TERMINATION FEE") in an amount equal to the following
percentage of the Revolving Loan Commitment: three percent (3.0%), if such early
termination occurs on or prior to the first anniversary date of this Agreement;
two percent (2.0%) if such early termination occurs after the first anniversary
date of this Agreement but on or before the second anniversary of this
Agreement; and one percent (1.0%) if such early termination occurs after the
second anniversary of the date of this Agreement but prior to the last day of
the Initial Term. Borrowers acknowledge that

                                       13
<PAGE>

the Termination Fee is an estimate of Lender's damages in the event of early
termination and is not a penalty. In the event of termination of the Credit
Facility, all of the Obligations shall be immediately due and payable upon the
termination date stated in any notice of termination. All undertakings,
agreements, covenants, warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in
the Loan Documents shall survive any such termination, and Lender shall retain
its security interests in the Collateral and all of its rights and remedies
under the Loan Documents notwithstanding such termination until Borrowers have
paid the Obligations to Lender, in full, in immediately available funds,
together with the applicable Termination Fee, if any. Notwithstanding the
payment in full of the Obligations, Lender shall not be required to terminate
its security interests in the Collateral unless either (1) the Obligations have
been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement,
or (2) if the Obligations have been satisfied by means other than Lender's
rights under the Guaranty Agreement, with respect to any loss or damage Lender
may incur as a result of dishonored checks or other items of payment received by
Lender from Borrowers or any Obligor and applied to the Obligations, Lender
shall, at its option, (i) have received a written agreement executed by
Borrowers and by any Person whose loans or other advances to Borrowers are used
in whole or in part to satisfy the Obligations, indemnifying Lender from any
such loss or damage; or (ii) have retained such monetary reserves and security
interests on the Collateral for such period of time as Lender, in its reasonable
discretion, may deem necessary to protect Lender from any such loss or damage.

                  (d) Borrowers shall unconditionally pay to Lender a fee
("UNUSED LINE FEE") equal to one half of one percent (0.50%) per annum of the
unused portion of the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility
shall be the difference between the Revolving Loan Commitment and the average
daily outstanding balance of the Loans during each month (or portion thereof),
which fees shall be calculated and payable monthly, in arrears, and shall be due
and payable on the first Designated Funding Date of each calendar month.

         2.4 Additional Interest Provisions:

                  (a) Calculation of Interest: Interest on the Loans shall be
based on a year of three hundred sixty (360) days and charged for the actual
number of days elapsed.

                  (b) Continuation of Interest Charges: All contractual rates of
interest chargeable on outstanding Loans shall continue to accrue and be paid
even after default, maturity, acceleration, termination of the Credit Facility,
judgment, bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings of any kind or the happening of any
event or occurrence similar or dissimilar.

                  (c) Applicable Interest Limitations: Borrowers and Lender
intend to conform strictly to the usury laws in force that apply to the
transactions evidenced or contemplated hereby. Accordingly, all agreements among
Borrowers and Lender, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether
written or oral, are hereby limited so that in no contingency, whether by reason
of acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Credit Note, or otherwise,
shall the interest (and all other sums that are deemed to be interest)
contracted for, charged, received, paid or agreed to be paid exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate (as defined below). Borrowers and Lender stipulate and agree that
the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement and the Loan Documents are
not intended to and shall never be construed to create a contract to pay for the
use, forbearance or

                                       14
<PAGE>

detention of money in an amount in excess of the maximum amount permitted to be
charged by applicable law, if any.

                  Anything in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the
contrary notwithstanding, neither Borrowers nor any other party now or hereafter
becoming liable for payment of the Revolving Credit Note shall ever be required
to pay interest on or with respect to the Revolving Credit Note or any other
obligation hereunder at a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and if the
effective rate of interest that would otherwise be payable under this Agreement
or on or with respect to the Revolving Credit Note would exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate, or if Lender shall receive anything of value that is deemed or
determined to constitute interest that would increase the effective rate of
interest payable under this Agreement or on or with respect to the Revolving
Credit Note or the Loan Documents to a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful
Rate, then (a) the amount of interest that would otherwise be payable under this
Agreement, the Revolving Credit Note or the Loan Documents shall be reduced to
the amount allowed at the Highest Lawful Rate under applicable law, and (b) any
unearned interest paid by the Borrowers or any interest paid by Borrowers in
excess of the Highest Lawful Rate shall, at the option of the Lender, be either
refunded to Borrowers or credited on the principal of such Revolving Credit
Note. It is further agreed that, without limitation of the foregoing, all
calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged or received by
Lender, or under this Agreement, that are made for the purpose of determining
whether such rate exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, shall be made, to the extent
permitted by applicable law (now or, to the extent permitted by law, hereafter
enacted) governing the Highest Lawful Rate, by (i) characterizing any
nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, and
(ii) amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading in equal parts during the
period of the full term of the Revolving Credit Note (including the period of
any renewal or extension thereof), all interest at any time contracted for,
charged or received by such registered holder in connection therewith. As used
herein, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum nonusurious rate of
interest permitted from time to time to be contracted for, taken, charged or
received with respect to the Revolving Credit Note by Lender, under applicable
law as in effect with respect to this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Note.

         2.5 Payments:

                  (a) All accrued interest on the Loans shall be due and payable
weekly on the Designated Funding Date. Any Unused Line Fees shall be due and
payable monthly on the first Designated Funding Date of each month with respect
to Unused Line Fees which accrued during the prior month.

                  (b) If at any time the aggregate principal amount of all
Advances outstanding exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect, Borrowers shall
immediately make such principal prepayments of the Loans (subject to the terms
of Sections 2.3(c) and 2.3(d)), as is necessary to eliminate such excess.

                  (c) The entire principal balance of all of the Advances,
together with all unpaid accrued interest thereon and the Termination Fee, if
any, and any unpaid Unused Line Fees, shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date.

                                       15
<PAGE>

                  (d) Subject to the terms of Sections 2.3(c) and 2.3(d) above,
Borrowers may prepay the principal of the Loans on any Designated Funding Date
by giving Lender written notice of the proposed prepayment two Business Days'
prior to such Designated Funding Date.

                  (e) All payments and prepayments shall be applied first to any
unpaid interest and fees and thereafter to the principal of the Loans and to
other amounts due Lender, in the order provided in Section 2.7(f) hereof. Except
as otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest, fees, or
other amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall be remitted to Lender in
immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the day
due. Whenever any payment is stated as due on a day which is not a Business Day,
the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day and interest shall continue to accrue during such extension.

         2.6 Use of Proceeds: The extensions of credit under and proceeds of the
Credit Facility shall be used to repay existing Indebtedness of Borrowers and
for working capital and general business purposes.

         2.7 Lockboxes and Collections:

                  (a) Borrowers (other than DCPS, MBS and IntegriMED) will enter
into lockbox agreements in respect of the Government Lockbox and Commercial
Lockbox in such form and with the Lockbox Bank or such other bank as is
acceptable to Lender. Borrowers shall instruct the Lockbox Bank maintaining the
Government Lockbox that all collections sent to the Government Lockbox shall be
deposited into a bank account at the Lockbox Bank in which Lender has a first
priority perfected security interest and all Collections sent to the Commercial
Lockbox shall be deposited into a bank account at the Lockbox Bank in the name
of Lender. Borrower shall also instruct the Lockbox Bank to initiate, or accept
an initiation from Lender which effectuates, a daily transfer of all available
funds to an account of Lender to be designated by Lender ("COLLECTION ACCOUNT").

                  (b) Borrowers (other than DCPS, MBS and IntegriMED) will cause
all Collections with respect to all of the Accounts, other than Government
Accounts, to be sent directly to the Commercial Lockbox, and will cause all
Collections with respect to all of the Government Accounts to be sent directly
to the Government Lockbox (which may be effectuated by electronic transfer
directly to the Government Lockbox). In the event that a Borrower receives any
Collections that should have been sent to the Commercial Lockbox or the
Government Lockbox, such Borrower will, promptly upon receipt and in any event
within one Business Day of receipt, forward such Collections directly to the
Commercial Lockbox or Government Lockbox, as applicable, in the form received,
and if requested by Lender, promptly notify Lender of such event. Until so
forwarded, such Collections not generated from Government Accounts shall be held
in trust for the benefit of Lender.

                  (c) No Borrower shall withdraw any amounts from the accounts
into which the Collections remitted to the Commercial Lockbox are deposited nor
shall any Borrower change the procedures under the agreements governing the
Commercial Lockbox and related accounts.

                                       16
<PAGE>

                  (d) Borrowers will cooperate with Lender in the identification
and reconciliation on a daily basis of all amounts received in the Commercial
Lockbox and the Government Lockbox. If more than five percent (5%) of the
Collections since the most recent Funding Date is not identified or reconciled
to the satisfaction of Lender within ten (10) Business Days of receipt, Lender
shall not be obligated to make further Loans until such amount is identified or
is reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Lender, as the case may be. In
addition, if any such amount cannot be identified or reconciled to the
reasonable satisfaction of Lender, Lender may utilize its own staff or, if it
deems necessary, engage an outside auditor, in either case at Borrowers' expense
(which in the case of Lender's own staff shall be in accordance with Lender's
then prevailing customary charges (plus expenses), to make such examination and
report as may be necessary to identify and reconcile such amount.

                  (e) No Borrower will send to or deposit in the Commercial
Lockbox or the Government Lockbox any funds other than payments made with
respect to Accounts.

                  (f) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, on each
Designated Funding Date, Lender shall cause all Collections deposited and/or
transferred to the Collection Account since the last Designated Funding Date to
be disbursed in the following order of priority:

                           (i) to Lender, any costs and Expenses of Lender
required to be paid or reimbursed by Borrowers under this Agreement or under any
of the other Loan Documents;

                           (ii) to Lender, an amount equal to the unpaid accrued
interest on the aggregate outstanding Advances as of such Designated Funding
Date;

                           (iii) to Lender, an amount equal to any unpaid
accrued Unused Line Fees which are then due and payable as of such Designated
Funding Date;

                           (iv) to Lender, the amount of any Borrowing Base
Deficiency, if any;

                           (v) to Lender, to the aggregate outstanding amount of
the Loans and any and all other fees due and payable hereunder in such order as
Lender may determine in its discretion; and

                           (vi) subject to Sections 2.3(c) and (d), to Lender,
the amount of any prepayment of principal of which Borrowers have given notice
to Lender in accordance with Section 2.5(d) hereof.

         In addition, promptly upon request of Borrowers, so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred, Lender shall disburse to Borrowers the amount, if
any, by which the collected balance in the Collection Account exceeds the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances and all interest and
other amounts that will be payable on the next Designated Funding Date.
Following the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may apply all
Collections to Borrowers' Obligations in such order as Lender may in its sole
discretion determine.

         2.8 Fees: Lender has fully earned a non-refundable commitment fee
("COMMITMENT FEE") equal to Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000) Lender acknowledges

Borrower shall have, prior to the related Funding Date, certified in an

transactions. To permit their uninterrupted and continuous operation, such
companies now require and will from time to time hereafter require funds for
general business purposes. The proceeds of Advances under the Credit Facility

require any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other intellectual property or

basis (a) the fair value of the Borrowers' assets is greater than the amount of
their liabilities (including disputed, contingent and unliquidated liabilities)

saleable value of their assets is not less than the amount that will be required
to pay the probable liability on their debts as they become absolute and
matured, (c) the Borrowers are able to realize upon their assets and pay their
debts and other liabilities (including disputed, contingent and unliquidated
liabilities) as they mature in the normal course of business, (d) the Borrowers
do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities
beyond their ability to pay as such debts and liabilities mature, and (e) the
Borrowers are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to
engage in business or a transaction, for which their property would constitute
unreasonably small capital.

         5.27 Acquisition Documents: Lender has received complete copies of the
Acquisition Documents (including all exhibits, schedules and disclosure letters
referred to therein or delivered pursuant thereto, if any) and all amendments
thereto, waivers relating thereto and other side letters or agreements affecting

         SECTION 6. BORROWER'S AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         Each Borrower covenants that until all of Borrowers' Obligations to
Lender are paid and satisfied in full and the Credit Facility has been
terminated:

         6.1 Payment of Taxes and Claims: Each Borrower shall pay, before they
become delinquent, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
imposed upon it or upon such Borrower's Property, except for those being
contested in good faith with due diligence by appropriate proceedings and for
which appropriate reserves have been maintained under GAAP.

         6.2 Maintenance of Insurance, Financial Records and Existence:

Payable and additional insured clauses issued in favor of Lender pursuant to
which all losses thereunder shall be paid to Lender as Lender's interests may
appear. Such policies shall expressly provide that the requisite insurance
cannot be altered or canceled without thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Lender and shall insure Lender notwithstanding the act or neglect of the
insured. At or prior to Closing, Borrowers shall furnish Lender with insurance
certificates certified as true and correct and being in full force and effect as
of the Closing Date or such other evidence of insurance as Lender may require.
In the event Borrowers fail to procure or cause to be procured any such
insurance or to timely pay or cause to be paid the premium(s) on any such
insurance, after five (5) days notice to the Borrowers unless Lender, in its
reasonable judgment, determines that immediate action is necessary to preserve
or protect its rights hereunder or in the Collateral, Lender may do so for
Borrowers, but Borrowers shall continue to be liable for the same. Borrowers
further covenant that all insurance premiums owing under its current casualty
policy have been paid. Borrowers also agree to notify Lender, promptly, upon
Borrowers' receipt of a notice of termination, cancellation or non-renewal from
its insurance company of any such policy. Each Borrower hereby appoints Lender
as its attorney-in-fact, exercisable at Lender's option, to endorse any check
which may be payable to such Borrower in order to collect the proceeds of such
insurance.

                  (b) Public Liability and Business Interruption Insurance -
Borrowers shall maintain, and shall deliver to Lender upon Lender's request
evidence of public liability and business interruption insurance in such amounts

advertise information to the effect that this transaction has closed, which
information may include, without limit, (i) the names of Borrowers and Lender,
(ii) the size of the transaction and (iii) those items of information commonly
included within a "tombstone advertisement" of the type customarily published in
financial or business periodicals.

         9.20 Discharge of Taxes, Borrower's Obligations, Etc.: Lender, in its
sole discretion, shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, with
prior notice to Borrowers, if Borrowers fail to do so five (5) Business Days
after requested in writing to do so by Lender, to: (a) pay for the performance
of any of Borrowers' obligations hereunder, and (b) discharge taxes or liens, at
any time levied or placed on any of Borrowers' Property in violation of this
Agreement unless Borrowers are in good faith with due diligence by appropriate
proceedings contesting such taxes or liens and have established appropriate
reserves therefor under GAAP. Expenses and advances shall be deemed Advances
hereunder and shall be

                                       47
<PAGE>

deemed Advances hereunder and shall bear interest at the highest rate applied to
the Loans until reimbursed to Lender. Such payments and advances made by Lender
shall not be construed as a waiver by Lender of an Event of Default under this
Agreement.

         9.21 Injunctive Relief: The parties acknowledge and agree that, in the
event of a breach or threatened breach of any party's obligations hereunder, may
have no adequate remedy in money damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to
an injunction (including without limitation, a temporary restraining order,
preliminary injunction, writ of attachment, or order compelling an audit)
against such breach or threatened breach, including without limitation,
maintaining the cash management and collection procedure described herein.
However, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable
remedy shall be construed as a waiver or prohibition against any other legal or
equitable remedies in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10. SPECIAL INTER-BORROWER PROVISIONS

         10.1 Certain Borrower Acknowledgments and Agreements:

                  (a) Each Borrower acknowledges that it will enjoy significant
benefits from the business conducted by the other Borrowers because of, inter
alia, their combined ability to bargain with other Persons including without
limitation their ability to receive the Credit Facility on favorable terms
granted by this Agreement and other Loan Documents which would not have been
available to an individual Borrower acting alone. Each Borrower has determined
that it is in its best interest to procure the Credit Facility which each
Borrower may utilize directly and which receive the credit support of the other
Borrowers as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) Lender has advised Borrowers that it is unwilling to enter
into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and make available the Credit
Facility extended hereby to any Borrower unless each Borrower agrees, among
other things, to be jointly and severally liable for the due and proper payment
of the Obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement and other Loan
Documents. Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest and in
pursuit of its purposes that it so induce Lender to extend credit pursuant to
this Agreement and the other documents executed in connection herewith (i)
because of the desirability to each Borrower of the Credit Facility, the
interest rates and the modes of borrowing available hereunder, (ii) because each
Borrower may engage in transactions jointly with other Borrowers and (iii)
because each Borrower may require, from time to time, access to funds under this
Agreement for the purposes herein set forth.

                  (c) Each Borrower has determined that it has and, after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, the inter-Borrower arrangement set
forth in this Section 10.1) will have, assets having a fair saleable value in
excess of the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing
debts as they fall due for payment and that the sum of its debts is not and will
not then be greater than all of its Property at a fair valuation, that such
Borrower has, and will have, access to adequate capital for the conduct of its
business and the ability to pay its debts from time to time incurred in

                                       48
<PAGE>

connection therewith as such debts mature and that the value of the benefits to
be derived by such Borrower from the access to funds under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the inter-Borrower arrangement set forth in this
Section 10.1) is reasonably equivalent to the obligations undertaken pursuant
hereto.

                  (d) Orion (on behalf of each Borrower) shall maintain records
specifying (a) all Obligations incurred by each Borrower, (b) the date of such
incurrence, (c) the date and amount of any payments made in respect of such
Obligations and (d) all inter-Borrower obligations pursuant to this Section 10.
Orion shall make copies of such records available to Lender, upon request.

         10.2 Maximum Amount Of Joint and Several Liability: To the extent that
applicable law otherwise would render the full amount of the joint and several
obligations of any Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents invalid
or unenforceable, such Borrower's obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents shall be limited to the maximum amount which does not result in such
invalidity or unenforceability, provided, however, that each Borrower's
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be presumptively
valid and enforceable to their fullest extent in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof, as if this Section 10.2 were not a part of this Agreement.

         10.3 Authorization of Orion by Borrowers:

                  (a) Each of Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorizes Orion to
give notices, make requests, make payments, receive payments and notices, give
receipts and execute agreements, make agreements or take any other action
whatever on behalf of such Borrower under and with respect to any Loan Document
and each Borrower shall be bound thereby. This authorization is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable, and Lender may rely on any notice, request,
information supplied by Orion every document executed by Orion every agreement
made by Orion or other action taken by Orion in respect of Borrowers or any
thereof as if the same were supplied, made or taken by any or all Borrowers.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the failure of one or more
Borrowers to join in the execution of any writing in connection herewith shall
not, unless the context clearly requires, relieve any such Borrower from
obligations in respect of such writing.

                  (b) Borrowers acknowledge that the credit provided hereunder
is on terms more favorable than any Borrower acting alone would receive and that
each Borrower benefits directly and indirectly from all Advances hereunder. Each
of Borrowers, shall be jointly and severally liable for all Obligations,
regardless of, inter alia, which Borrower requested (or received the proceeds
of) a particular Advance.

         (4) The liability of the Undersigned hereunder is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be reduced, impaired or affected in any way by
reason of (a) any failure to obtain, retain or preserve, or the lack of prior
enforcement of, any rights against any person or persons (including Borrower and
the Undersigned) or in any property, (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of

related agreements, are cumulative and not alternative. You may proceed in any
order from time to time against Borrower and/or any other obligor of Borrower's
Obligations (other than the Undersigned) and their respective assets. From and
after the Guaranty Payment Date you shall not have any obligation to proceed
against, or exhaust any or all of your rights against Borrower or any other
obligor of Borrower's Obligations and their respective assets, prior to
proceeding against the Undersigned hereunder.

         (7) Any and all rights of any nature of the Undersigned to subrogation,
reimbursement or indemnity and any right of the Undersigned to recourse to any
assets or property of Borrower for any reason are hereby unconditionally waived,
until such time as the Obligations of Borrower to Lender are indefeasibly paid
and satisfied in full.

         (8) Your books and records of any and all of Borrower's Obligations,

Undersigned hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver thereof or preclude the
exercise of any other right or remedy hereunder. No waiver of any breach of or
provision of this Guaranty Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or of any other provision. The invalidity or unenforceability
of

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE
ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES
UNDER SUCH ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REQUIREMENT UNDER SUCH ACT.

                                                                 20,455 Warrants

                        COMMON STOCK WARRANT CERTIFICATE

          To subscribe for and purchase shares of Class A Common Stock,
                              par value $0.001, of

                             ORION HEALTHCORP, INC.


      THIS CERTIFIES that, for valued received, Brantley Partners IV, L.P., or
its registered successors and assigns, is the owner of the number of warrants
(the "Warrants") set forth above, each to purchase from Orion HealthCorp, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Company"), at any time but in any
event no later than 5:00 p.m., New York time on December 15, 2009 (the
"Expiration Date"), one share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company at an initial exercise price of $0.01, subject to
adjustment from time to time pursuant to the provisions of Section 2. The
Warrants evidenced by the Warrant Certificate may be exercised, if at all, only
in whole and not in part. For purposes of this Warrant Certificate, the term
"Common Shares" shall mean the class of capital stock of the Company designated
Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, pursuant to the Company's
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as from time to time in
effect, and any other class of capital stock of the Company resulting from
successive changes or reclassification of the Class A Common Stock.

      1.    Exercise of Warrants.

            (a)   The Warrants evidenced hereby may be exercised at any time
      through the Expiration Date by the registered holder hereof, in whole but
      not in part, by the surrender of this Warrant Certificate, duly endorsed
      (unless endorsement is waived by the Company), at the principal office of
      the Company (or at such other office or agency of the Company as it may
      designate by notice in writing to the registered holder hereof at such
      holder's last address appearing on the books of the Company) and upon
      payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (as defined below) of the Common
      Shares purchased. The certificate(s) for such Common Shares shall be
      delivered to the registered holder hereof within a reasonable time, not
      exceeding three (3) business days, after Warrants evidenced hereby shall
      have been so exercised. No fractional Common Shares of the Company, or
      scrips for any such fractional shares, shall be issued upon the exercise
      of any Warrants; but the holder hereof shall be entitled to cash equal to
      such fraction multiplied by the then Current Market Value of a Common
      Share.
<PAGE>
            (b)   In the event the Current Market Value of a Common Share
      exceeds the Exercise Price on the business day immediately prior to the
      exercise of the Warrants, the Holder may exercise the Warrants held by
      such holder, without the payment of any additional consideration, for a
      number of Common Shares determined by dividing (i) the result of the
      difference between such Current Market Value and the Exercise Price times
      the number of Common Shares into which the Warrants held by such Holder
      are exercisable by (ii) such Current Market Value.

            (c)   For the purpose of any computation of Current Market Value
      under this Warrant, the Current Market Value per Common Share at any date
      shall be (x) the closing price on the business day immediately prior to
      the exercise of the Warrants pursuant to Section 1(b) and (y) in all other
      cases, the average of the daily closing prices for the 20 consecutive
      trading days ending on the last full trading day on the exchange or market
      specified in the second succeeding sentence prior to the Time of
      Determination. The term "Time of Determination" as used herein shall be
      the time and date of the earlier to occur of (A) the date as of which the
      Current Market Value is to be computed and (B) the last full trading day
      on such exchange or market before the commencement of "ex-dividend"
      trading in the Common Stock relating to the event giving rise to the
      adjustment required by Section 2. The closing price for any day shall be
      the last reported sale price regular way or, in case no such reported sale
      takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices
      regular way for such day, in each case (1) on the principal national
      securities exchange on which the Common Shares listed or to which such
      shares are admitted to trading or (2) if the Common Shares are not listed
      or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange, in the
      over-the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ or any comparable system or
      (3) if the Common Shares are not listed on NASDAQ or a comparable system,
      as furnished by two members of the NASD selected from time to time in good
      faith by the Board of Directors of the Company for that purpose. In the
      absence of all of the foregoing, or if for any other reason the Current
      Market Value per share cannot be determined pursuant to the foregoing
      provisions of this Section 1(c), the Current Market Value per share shall
      be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board
      of Directors of the Company.

      2.    Adjustment in Exercise Price and Number of Shares. The initial
exercise price of $0.01 per share shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as hereinafter provided (such price, as last adjusted, being herein called
the "Exercise Price"). Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price, the holder of
this Warrant Certificate shall thereafter be entitled to purchase at the
Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares obtained by
dividing the product of the number of shares purchasable pursuant hereto
immediately prior to such adjustment and the Exercise Price immediately
preceding such adjustment by the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.

            (a)   Subdivision or Combination of Stock. If and whenever the
      Company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding Common Shares into a
      greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
      to such subdivision shall be proportionately
<PAGE>
      reduced, and conversely, in case the outstanding Common Shares of the
      Company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise
      Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be
      proportionately increased.

            (b)   Stock Dividends. If and whenever at any time the Company shall
      declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon any class or series
      of stock of the Company payable in Common Shares, the Exercise Price in
      effect immediately prior to such dividend or distribution shall be
      proportionately reduced as if such dividend or distribution had been made
      by way of a subdivision pursuant to Section 2(a) above.

            (c)   Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger. If
      any capital reorganization, reclassification of the capital stock of the
      Company, consolidation or merger of the Company with another corporation,
      or sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
      Company's properties to another corporation shall be effected, then,
      lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby each holder of
      Warrants shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive upon the
      basis and upon the terms and conditions herein specified and in lieu of
      the Common Shares immediately theretofore issuable upon exercise or the
      Warrants, such shares of stock, securities or properties (including cash
      paid as partial consideration) (collectively, the "Substitute Securities")
      as may be issuable or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number
      of outstanding Common Shares equal to the number of Common Shares issuable
      upon exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such reorganization,
      reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or other
      disposition, and in any such case, appropriate provision shall be made
      with respect to the rights and interests of each holder of Warrants to the
      end that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly
      equivalent as may be practicable in relation to any Substitute Securities
      thereafter deliverable upon the exercise thereof. The above provisions of
      this Section 2(c) shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations,
      reclassification, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or
      dispositions.

      3.    Company to Provide Stock. The Company covenants and agrees that all
the Common Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the Warrants
evidenced hereby upon the due exercise, including the receipt by the Company of
the aggregate Exercise Price for all Warrants exercised, will be duly
authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and free from all
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof to the registered
holder hereof other than those which the Company shall promptly pay or
discharge. The Company further covenants and agrees that during the period
within which the Warrants evidenced hereby may be exercised, the Company will at
all times reserve such number of Common Shares as may be sufficient to permit
the exercise in full of the Warrants hereby.

      4.    Other Notices. If any time prior to the Expiration of the Warrants
evidenced hereby:

            (a)   The Company shall declare any dividend on the Common Shares
      payable in shares of capital stock of the Company other than Common
      Shares; or

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>
            (b)   The Company shall issue any options, warrants or rights pro
      rata to all holders of Common Shares entitling them to subscribe for or
      purchase any shares of stock of the Company or to receive any other
      rights; or

            (c)   The Company shall distribute pro rata to all holders of Common
      Shares evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash
      distributions); or

            (d)   There shall occur any reclassification of the Common Shares,
      or any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another
      corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is
      the continuing corporation and which does not result in any
      reclassification of the Common Stock) or a sale or transfer to another
      corporation of all or substantially all of the properties of the Company;
      or

            (e)   There shall occur the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
      dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company;

then, and in each of such cases, the Company shall mail to the registered holder
hereof at its last address appearing on the books of the Company, a reasonable
time (and, in any event, at least fifteen (15) business days) prior to the
applicable record date (or determination date) mentioned below, a notice
stating, to the extent such information is available, (i) the date on which a
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights,
or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common
Shares or of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are
to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up is expected to become effective and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Shares of record shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Shares for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.

      5.    Replacement of Warrants. On receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant Certificate, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction
of this Warrant Certificate, on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Company or, in the case of any such
mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of such Warrant Certificate, unless
the Company has received notice that any such Warrant Certificate has been
acquired by a bona fide purchase, the Company at its expense will execute and
deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor.

      6.    Registered Holder. The registered holder of this Warrant Certificate
shall be deemed the owner hereof and of the Warrants evidenced hereby for all
purposes. The registered holder of this Warrant Certificate shall not be
entitled by virtue of ownership of this Warrant Certificate to any rights
whatsoever as a shareholder of the Company.

      7.    Amendments and Waivers. Any provision in this Warrant Certificate to
the contrary notwithstanding, changes in or additions to this Warrant
Certificate may be made and compliance with any covenant or provision herein set
forth may be omitted or waived if the Company shall obtain consent thereto in
writing from the holder hereof.

      8.    Transfer.

            (a)   None of this Warrant Certificate and the Warrants evidenced
      hereby nor any Common Shares issued or exercise hereof may be sold,
      transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless and
      until: (i) there is then in effect a registration statement under the
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), covering such
      proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such
      registration statement and all applicable state securities laws; or (ii)
      (A) the transferor shall have notified the Company of the proposed
      disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a statement of the
      circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and (B) if reasonably
      requested by the Company, such transferor shall have furnished the Company
      with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that
      such disposition will not require registration of such securities under
      the Securities Act and that all requisite action has been or will, on a
      timely basis, be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
      connection with such disposition; and (iii) the proposed transferee shall
      have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms and provisions of this
      Section 8.

            (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8(a), no such
      registration statement or opinion of counsel shall be necessary for a
      transfer pursuant to Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Securities Act, or
      a transfer to an entity wholly owned by such transferor, if the transferee
      agrees in writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the same extent as
      if such transferee were an original holder of this certificate.

            (c)   This Warrant Certificate may be transferred only in whole and
      not in part.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Orion HealthCorp, Inc. has caused this Warrant
Certificate to be signed by a duly authorized officer under seal, and this

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE
ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES
UNDER SUCH ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REQUIREMENT UNDER SUCH ACT.

                                                                  4,545 Warrants

                        COMMON STOCK WARRANT CERTIFICATE

To subscribe for and purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001,
                                       of

                             ORION HEALTHCORP, INC.

         THIS CERTIFIES that, for valued received, Brantley Capital Corporation,
or its registered successors and assigns, is the owner of the number of warrants
(the "Warrants") set forth above, each to purchase from Orion HealthCorp, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (herein called the "Company"), at any time but in any
event no later than 5:00 p.m., New York time on December 15, 2009 (the
"Expiration Date"), one share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company at an initial exercise price of $0.01, subject to
adjustment from time to time pursuant to the provisions of Section 2. The
Warrants evidenced by the Warrant Certificate may be exercised, if at all, only
in whole and not in part. For purposes of this Warrant Certificate, the term
"Common Shares" shall mean the class of capital stock of the Company designated
Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, pursuant to the Company's
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as from time to time in
effect, and any other class of capital stock of the Company resulting from
successive changes or reclassification of the Class A Common Stock.

         1. Exercise of Warrants.

                  (a) The Warrants evidenced hereby may be exercised at any time
         through the Expiration Date by the registered holder hereof, in whole
         but not in part, by the surrender of this Warrant Certificate, duly
         endorsed (unless endorsement is waived by the Company), at the
         principal office of the Company (or at such other office or agency of
         the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered
         holder hereof at such holder's last address appearing on the books of
         the Company) and upon payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (as
         defined below) of the Common Shares purchased. The certificate(s) for
         such Common Shares shall be delivered to the registered holder hereof
         within a reasonable time, not exceeding three (3) business days, after
         Warrants evidenced hereby shall have been so exercised. No fractional
         Common Shares of the Company, or scrips for any such fractional shares,
         shall be issued upon the exercise of any Warrants; but the holder
         hereof shall be entitled to cash equal to such fraction multiplied by
         the then Current Market Value of a Common Share.

<PAGE>

                  (b) In the event the Current Market Value of a Common Share
         exceeds the Exercise Price on the business day immediately prior to the
         exercise of the Warrants, the Holder may exercise the Warrants held by
         such holder, without the payment of any additional consideration, for a
         number of Common Shares determined by dividing (i) the result of the
         difference between such Current Market Value and the Exercise Price
         times the number of Common Shares into which the Warrants held by such
         Holder are exercisable by (ii) such Current Market Value.

                  (c) For the purpose of any computation of Current Market Value
         under this Warrant, the Current Market Value per Common Share at any
         date shall be (x) the closing price on the business day immediately
         prior to the exercise of the Warrants pursuant to Section 1(b) and (y)
         in all other cases, the average of the daily closing prices for the 20
         consecutive trading days ending on the last full trading day on the
         exchange or market specified in the second succeeding sentence prior to
         the Time of Determination. The term "Time of Determination" as used
         herein shall be the time and date of the earlier to occur of (A) the
         date as of which the Current Market Value is to be computed and (B) the
         last full trading day on such exchange or market before the
         commencement of "ex-dividend" trading in the Common Stock relating to
         the event giving rise to the adjustment required by Section 2. The
         closing price for any day shall be the last reported sale price regular
         way or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the
         average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way for such day,
         in each case (1) on the principal national securities exchange on which
         the Common Shares listed or to which such shares are admitted to
         trading or (2) if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to
         trading on a national securities exchange, in the over-the-counter
         market as reported by NASDAQ or any comparable system or (3) if the
         Common Shares are not listed on NASDAQ or a comparable system, as
         furnished by two members of the NASD selected from time to time in good
         faith by the Board of Directors of the Company for that purpose. In the
         absence of all of the foregoing, or if for any other reason the Current
         Market Value per share cannot be determined pursuant to the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 1(c), the Current Market Value per share
         shall be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by
         the Board of Directors of the Company.

         2. Adjustment in Exercise Price and Number of Shares. The initial
exercise price of $0.01 per share shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as hereinafter provided (such price, as last adjusted, being herein called
the "Exercise Price"). Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price, the holder of
this Warrant Certificate shall thereafter be entitled to purchase at the
Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares obtained by
dividing the product of the number of shares purchasable pursuant hereto
immediately prior to such adjustment and the Exercise Price immediately
preceding such adjustment by the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.

                  (a) Subdivision or Combination of Stock. If and whenever the
         Company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding Common Shares into
         a greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately
         prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately

<PAGE>

         reduced, and conversely, in case the outstanding Common Shares of the
         Company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise
         Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be
         proportionately increased.

                  (b) Stock Dividends. If and whenever at any time the Company
         shall declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon any class
         or series of stock of the Company payable in Common Shares, the
         Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such dividend or
         distribution shall be proportionately reduced as if such dividend or
         distribution had been made by way of a subdivision pursuant to Section
         2(a) above.

                  (c) Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger.
         If any capital reorganization, reclassification of the capital stock of
         the Company, consolidation or merger of the Company with another
         corporation, or sale, transfer or other disposition of all or
         substantially all of the Company's properties to another corporation
         shall be effected, then, lawful and adequate provision shall be made
         whereby each holder of Warrants shall thereafter have the right to
         purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions
         herein specified and in lieu of the Common Shares immediately
         theretofore issuable upon exercise or the Warrants, such shares of
         stock, securities or properties (including cash paid as partial
         consideration) (collectively, the "Substitute Securities") as may be
         issuable or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of
         outstanding Common Shares equal to the number of Common Shares issuable
         upon exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such reorganization,
         reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or other
         disposition, and in any such case, appropriate provision shall be made
         with respect to the rights and interests of each holder of Warrants to
         the end that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as
         nearly equivalent as may be practicable in relation to any Substitute
         Securities thereafter deliverable upon the exercise thereof. The above
         provisions of this Section 2(c) shall similarly apply to successive
         reorganizations, reclassification, consolidations, mergers, sales,
         transfers or dispositions.

         3. Company to Provide Stock. The Company covenants and agrees that all

the aggregate Exercise Price for all Warrants exercised, will be duly
authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and free from all
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof to the registered
holder hereof other than those which the Company shall promptly pay or
discharge. The Company further covenants and agrees that during the period
within which the Warrants evidenced hereby may be exercised, the Company will at
all times reserve such number of Common Shares as may be sufficient to permit

evidenced hereby:

                  (a) The Company shall declare any dividend on the Common

                  (b) The Company shall issue any options, warrants or rights

         other rights; or

                  (c) The Company shall distribute pro rata to all holders of
         Common Shares evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash
         distributions); or

                  (d) There shall occur any reclassification of the Common
         Shares, or any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into
         another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
         Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any
         reclassification of the Common Stock) or a sale or transfer to another
         corporation of all or substantially all of the properties of the
         Company; or

                  (e) There shall occur the voluntary or involuntary
         liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company;

then, and in each of such cases, the Company shall mail to the registered holder
hereof at its last address appearing on the books of the Company, a reasonable
time (and, in any event, at least fifteen (15) business days) prior to the
applicable record date (or determination date) mentioned below, a notice
stating, to the extent such information is available, (i) the date on which a
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights,
or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common
Shares or of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are
to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up is expected to become effective and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Shares of record shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Shares for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.

         5. Replacement of Warrants. On receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant Certificate, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction
of this Warrant Certificate, on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Company or, in the case of any such
mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of such Warrant Certificate, unless
the Company has received notice that any such Warrant Certificate has been
acquired by a bona fide purchase, the Company at its expense will execute and
deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor.

         6. Registered Holder. The registered holder of this Warrant Certificate
shall be deemed the owner hereof and of the Warrants evidenced hereby for all
purposes. The registered holder of this Warrant Certificate shall not be
entitled by virtue of ownership of this Warrant Certificate to any rights
whatsoever as a shareholder of the Company.

the contrary notwithstanding, changes in or additions to this Warrant
Certificate may be made and compliance with any covenant or provision herein set

         evidenced hereby nor any Common Shares issued or exercise hereof may be

         transferor shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel,
         reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such disposition will not
         require registration of such securities under the Securities Act and
         that all requisite action has been or will, on a timely basis, be taken
         under any applicable state securities laws in connection with such
         disposition; and (iii) the proposed transferee shall have agreed in

         transfer pursuant to Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Securities Act,
         or a transfer to an entity wholly owned by such transferor, if the
         transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the
         same extent as if such transferee were an original holder of this
         certificate.

                  (c) This Warrant Certificate may be transferred only in whole
         and not in part.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 15,
2004, between Orion HealthCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with an executive
office located at 1805 Old Alabama Road, Suite 350, Roswell, Georgia 30076
(together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement, the
"Company"), and Terrence L. Bauer, who resides at the address set forth on
Schedule I hereto (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into an employment
arrangement; and

      WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement setting forth the
obligations and duties of both the Company and the Executive; and

      WHEREAS, the Company wishes to assure itself of the services of the
Executive for the period hereinafter provided, and the Executive is willing to
be employed by the Company for said period, upon the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants

      2. Term. Subject to the provisions for earlier termination as hereinafter
provided, the term of this Employment Agreement will begin on the date hereof
and will continue for five (5) years hereafter (the "Initial Term of
Employment"). This Agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of the
Initial Term of Employment and each successive renewal term thereafter for
successive two (2) year terms unless either party sends written notice of

prior to the expiration of the then current Term of Employment (as hereinafter
defined). The Initial Term of Employment together with any renewal terms is

            (a) The Executive will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the
      Company and will perform all duties customarily attendant to the position

      subcommittees thereof.

            (b) The Executive will devote his full business time and best
      efforts to his employment and perform diligently such duties as are
      consistent with his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
      such other duties as the Board reasonably determines that are consistent
      with his position. The Executive will devote his entire working time and
      attention to the performance of his responsibilities hereunder; provided,
      the Executive may make personal investments, engage in outside
      non-competitive business activities or engage in other activities for any
      charitable or other non-profit institution, provided that such activities
      do not interfere with the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder.

            (c) In connection with the Executive's employment by the Company,
      the Executive will be based at the Company's place of business which on
      the date hereof is located in Atlanta, Georgia, or such other location as
      may, subject to Section 8(d), be designated from time to time by the
      Board.

      4. Base Salary. The Executive will receive from the Company an annual base
salary of Two Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($240,000) (as from time to time
adjusted, the "Base Salary"), payable in accordance with the standard practice
of the Company with respect to the payment of salaries of its employees. The
Board will review the Base Salary annually, and may, in its reasonable
discretion, adjust the Base Salary.

      5. Annual Bonus. The Executive may be paid a bonus annually based upon the
attainment of objectives determined by the Board after consultation with the
Executive. Within 90 days after the start of each fiscal year, the Board will

unless the Board and the Executive shall mutually agree otherwise, such
objectives shall apply to such fiscal year.

      with such medical, hospitalization, insurance, pension plan, profit
      sharing and employee benefits, cell phone and such other similar

      from time to time to other executive employees of the Company, and four
      (4) weeks paid vacation each year.

            (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall receive
      Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per month (pre-tax) as an automobile
      allowance. The Company shall pay all reasonable maintenance and repair
      expenses with respect to the automobile used primarily for business
      purposes by the Executive, procure and maintain in force collision,

      7. Expense Reimbursement. During the Term of Employment, the Executive

under the following circumstances:

            (a) Death. The Executive's employment is terminated upon his death.

            (b) Disability. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the
      Company due to illness or other physical or mental disability of the
      Executive, resulting in his inability to perform substantially his duties
      under this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) or more consecutive days
      or for one hundred eighty (180) days in the aggregate during any
      consecutive twelve (12) month period ("Disability").

            (c) Cause. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the

                  (i) the Executive's indictment for any crime involving monies
            or other property or any felony, crime or any offense of moral
            turpitude, or his commission of fraud, embezzlement, theft,
            dishonesty, willful misconduct or deliberate injury to the Company
            or its subsidiaries;

                  (ii) the Executive's intentional or grossly negligent refusal
            or failure to perform his duties or carry out directions of the
            Company's Board, which refusal or failure remains uncured or
            continues more than thirty (30) days after notice from the Company
            specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs
            within such period;

                  (iii) the Executive's breach of any of his fiduciary duties to
            the Company or making of a willful misrepresentation or omission,
            which breach or misrepresentation or omission might reasonably be
            expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business
            and which remains uncured or continues more than thirty (30) days
            after notice from the Company specifying in reasonable detail the
            nature of the breach or misrepresentation or omission, or recurs
            within such period;

                  (iv) the Executive's breach of any material provision of this
            Agreement, which breach, if curable, remains uncured or continues
            more than thirty (30) days after notice from the Company specifying
            in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs within such
            period; or

                                       3
<PAGE>

                  (v) any misappropriation by the Executive of funds or property
            of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.

      Any termination for "Cause" will not be in limitation of any other right
      or remedy the Company may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

            (d) Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment under
      this Agreement for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, the
      Executive will have "Good Reason" to terminate the Executive's employment
      upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances, without the
      Executive's express written consent: (i) a material diminution in the
      Executive's position or authority (except during periods when the
      Executive is unable to perform all or substantially all of the Executive's
      duties and/or responsibilities as a result of the Executive's illness
      (either physical or mental) or other incapacity); (ii) a requirement by
      the Company that the Executive change the Executive's principal place of
      business to a place more than thirty (30) miles from its location on the
      date of this Agreement; (iii) a termination of employment by the Executive
      within ninety (90) days following a Change in Control (as defined below),
      provided, that Good Reason will not exist if the Executive has accepted or
      agreed to continue employment following the Change of Control with the
      surviving or successor entity and such surviving or successor entity has
      agreed to continue or assume this Agreement, provided, further, in the
      event of a Change of Control, the Executive is under no obligation to
      continue or accept employment with the surviving or successor entity and
      may instead elect to terminate his employment for Good Reason upon such
      Change of Control; (iv) a breach of this Agreement by the Company which is
      not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice by the Company; or (v)
      any reduction in the Executive's Base Salary. The Executive's right to
      terminate employment pursuant to this subsection 8(d) will not be affected
      by the Executive's Disability. The Executive's continued employment will
      not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
      circumstance constituting consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect
      to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason; provided, however, that the
      Executive will be deemed to have waived his rights pursuant to
      circumstances constituting Good Reason if he has not provided to the
      Company a Notice of Termination (as defined below) within ninety (90) days
      following his knowledge of the circumstances constituting Good Reason. A
      waiver with respect to the circumstances constituting Good Reason will not
      act as a waiver with respect to other future circumstances constituting
      Good Reason.

            Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive must
      be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the Company in
      accordance with Section 19. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
      Termination" means a notice which indicates the specific termination
      provision in this Agreement relied upon and sets forth in reasonable
      detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
      termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so
      indicated.

            For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" will occur:
      (i) upon the sale or other disposition of 50% or more of the consolidated
      assets of the Company taken

                                       4
<PAGE>

      as a whole; (ii) if shares representing a majority of the voting power of
      the Company are acquired by a person or group (as such term is used in
      Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
      amended) of persons other than the holders of the capital stock of the
      Company as of the date of this Agreement; (iii) upon a merger or
      consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the equity securities of
      the Company before the merger or consolidation do not own equity
      securities representing a majority of the voting power of the surviving
      entity after the merger or consolidation; or (iv) upon approval by the
      shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of
      the Company.

      9. Compensation Upon Termination.

            (a) If the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of the
      Executive's death or Disability, he, or his estate, will be entitled to:

            current fiscal year of the Company;

                  (iv) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable

                  (iv) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result
            of notice of nonrenewal provided by the Executive under Section 2,
            he will be entitled to a prorated bonus for the year in which his
            employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked,
            minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this

            (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
      without Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, he will be entitled
      to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            but not yet paid, payable as soon as administratively feasible
            following termination of employment;

                  (iii) continuation of his Base Salary, at the rate in effect
            on the date of his termination of employment (which, in the case of
            a termination of the Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section
            8(d)(v), shall be deemed to be the rate in effect prior to giving
            any effect to the reduction in Base Salary giving rise to such Good
            Reason), until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period (as
            defined below);

                  (iv) the greater of: (A) a prorated bonus for the year in
            which employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days
            worked, or (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average
            of the bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            during the two (2) calendar years preceding such termination, if
            any, minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable in either event as soon as administratively feasible
            following the end of the then fiscal year of the Company; provided,
            however, that this clause (iv) shall not be applicable in the event
            that the Executive's employment is terminated upon notice of
            nonrenewal provided by the Company under Section 2;

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (v) until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
            subject to any employee contribution applicable to the Executive on
            the date of termination, continued participation in all of the
            Company's group medical and dental insurance plans in which he was
            participating on the date of his termination of employment, provided
            that the Executive is entitled to continue such participation under
            applicable law and plan terms;

                  (vi) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expenses incurred by the Executive but not yet paid to him
            on the date of his termination of employment, payable as soon as
            administratively feasible following termination of employment; and

                  (vii) full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            In the event that, under the terms of any employee benefit plan
      referred to in subsection 9(c)(v) above, the Executive may not continue
      his participation, he will be provided with the after-tax economic
      equivalent of the benefits provided under any plan in which he was
      previously eligible to participate for the period specified in subsection
      9(c)(v) above. The economic equivalent of any benefit foregone will be
      deemed to be the cost that would be incurred by the Executive in obtaining
      such benefit on the lowest available individual basis.

            (d) Any amounts due under this Section 9 are in the nature of
      severance payments or liquidated damages or both, and will fully
      compensate the Executive and his dependents or beneficiaries, as the case
      may be, for any and all direct damages and consequential damages that any
      of them may suffer as a result of termination of the Executive's
      employment, and they are not in the nature of a penalty.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, any obligation of the
      Company to the Executive under Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vii) is
      conditioned upon (i) the Executive signing a release of claims in the form
      attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Employee Release") within twenty-one
      days (or such greater period as the Company may specify) following the
      later of the date on which the Executive (or, in the case of termination
      by the Executive for Good Reason, the Company) receives notice of
      termination of employment or the date the Executive receives a copy of the
      Employee Release and upon the Executive not revoking the Employee Release
      in a timely manner thereafter and (ii) the Executive's continuing
      compliance with the provisions of Section 10. If the Executive breaches
      any provision of Section 10, upon written notice of such breach and
      request for repayment from the Company, the Executive shall promptly pay
      to the Company an amount equal to the sum of any cash payments previously
      paid to the Executive pursuant to Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vii).
      Any such repayment shall not be the exclusive remedy for any such breach
      and the Company shall retain all rights to pursue other available remedies
      (whether at law or equity) for any such breach.

                                       7

      10. Confidentiality and Non-Competition.

            (a) The Executive acknowledges that he has had or will have
      unlimited access to confidential information and business methods relating
      to the Company's business and operations and that the Company would be
      irreparably injured and the goodwill of the Company would be irreparably
      damaged if the Executive were to breach the covenants set forth in this
      Section 10. The Executive further acknowledges that the covenants set
      forth in this Section 10 are reasonable in scope and duration and do not
      unreasonably restrict the Executive's association with other business
      entities, either as an employee or otherwise as set forth herein.

            (b) During the Term of Employment and thereafter, except as may be
      required by law or necessary in connection with any dealings with any
      public agency or authority or in the ordinary course of business during
      the Term of Employment pursuant to customary non-disclosure agreements,
      the Executive will not disclose, disseminate, divulge, discuss, copy or
      otherwise use or suffer to be used, including but not limited to in
      competition with, or in a manner harmful to the interests of, the Company,
      any confidential information (written or oral) respecting any material
      aspect of the Company's business, excepting only use of such data or
      information as is (i) at the time disclosed, through no act or failure to
      act on the part of the Executive, generally known or available; (ii)
      furnished to the Executive by a third party as a matter of right and
      without restriction on disclosure; or (iii) required to be disclosed by
      court order. Upon termination of the Term of Employment, the Executive
      will return to the Company any and all materials in tangible or electronic
      form containing confidential information belonging to the Company.

            (c) During the Term of Employment and the Non-Competition Period,
      the Executive will not in the states of California, Florida, Georgia,
      Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio or Texas, directly or indirectly, whether
      as an individual on the Executive's own account, or as a shareholder,
      partner, member, joint venturer, director, officer, employee, consultant,
      creditor and/or agent, of any person, firm or organization or otherwise:

                  (i) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership,
            management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise
            affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or
            otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
            firm, association or other business entity or otherwise engage in
            any business that is engaged in the business of the Company or any
            of the Company's subsidiaries (collectively, "Subsidiaries"), as
            such business is conducted on the applicable date during the Term of
            Employment, or in the case of the Non-Competition Period, as of the
            date the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company, in any
            capacity, including as a consultant;

                  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any
            person who is a present or future employee, officer, agent,
            affiliate or customer of the Company or

                                       8
<PAGE>

            any Subsidiary to terminate or materially alter such person's
            relationship with the Company or such Subsidiary;

                  (iii) induce any supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary, to
            refuse to do business with the Company or any Subsidiary, on as
            favorable terms as previously done with the Company or any
            Subsidiary, as the case may be; or

                  (iv) engage in disparagement (which will not include the
            providing of accurate information without invidious intent) of the
            Company or any Subsidiary by any means to any person.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Competition Period" shall mean the
      period during the Term of Employment and thereafter until the second
      anniversary of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with
      the Company; provided, however, that the Company may, by written notice to
      the Executive (whether given before or after the date of termination of
      the Executive's employment with the Company), shorten the portion of the
      Non-Competition Period occurring following the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with the Company to any date specified in such
      notice which occurs on or after the earlier of (x) the second anniversary
      of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with the Company
      and (y) the date of expiration of the then current Term of Employment.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or the
      Executive provides notice of nonrenewal under Section 2, then: (1) the
      Company shall have the option to continue to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of his termination of
      employment, until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period; (2) if the
      Company exercises such option, it may discontinue the payment of Base
      Salary at any time; (3) the Executive shall be subject to Section 10(c)(i)
      only for so long as the Company continues to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary; and (4) if the Company stops paying the Executive his Base Salary,
      then the Executive shall no longer be subject to Section 10(c)(i), but
      shall remain subject to the rest of this Section 10.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive
      will be permitted to own shares of any class of capital stock of any
      publicly held corporation so long as the aggregate holdings of the
      Executive represent less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
      of such class of capital stock.

      11. Rights and Remedies Upon Breach.

            (a) The Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy
      at law for any breach by the Executive of Section 10 will be inadequate
      and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible
      to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that
      upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of Section 10, the
      Company will be entitled, among other remedies, to injunctive relief and
      may obtain a temporary restraining order restraining any threatened or
      further breach. Nothing in this Section 11(a) will be deemed to limit the
      Company's

                                       9
<PAGE>

      remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the Executive of any of the
      provisions of this Agreement which may be pursued or availed of by the
      Company.

            (b) In the event any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
      the specified time period or geographical area set forth in Section 10 is
      unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
      period or geographical area that is determined by the court to be
      reasonable, non-arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced.

      12. Withholding Taxes. All payments to the Executive or his beneficiary
will be subject to withholding on account of federal, state and local taxes as
required by law. If any payment hereunder is insufficient to provide the amount
of such taxes required to be withheld, the Company may withhold such taxes from
any other payment due the Executive or his beneficiary.

      13. Assignability; Binding Nature. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs (in
the case of the Executive) and assigns. No rights or obligations of the Company
under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company except that
such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant to (i) a
merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the continuing entity or
(ii) a sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and such assignee or transferee
assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, as contained in
this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. The Company further
agrees that, in the event of a sale of assets or liquidation as described in the
preceding sentence, it will use its best efforts to cause such assignee or
transferee to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Company hereunder. No obligations of the Executive under this Agreement may be
assigned or transferred by the Executive.

      14. Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties
concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof.

      15. Amendment or Waiver. No provision in this Agreement may be amended
unless such amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by both the Executive
and an authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by either Party of any
breach by the other Party of any condition or provision contained in this
Agreement to be performed by such other Party will be deemed a waiver of a
similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or
subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the Executive or an
authorized officer of the Company, as the case may be.

      16. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole
or in part, the remaining

                                       10
<PAGE>

provisions of this Agreement will be unaffected thereby and will remain in full
force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

      17. Survivorship. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder will survive any termination of the Executive's employment with the
Company to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations as described in this Agreement.

      18. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without
reference to principles of conflict of laws.

      19. Notices. Any notice given to either Party must be in writing and will
be deemed to have been given when delivered personally or one (1) day after
having been sent by overnight courier service or three (3) days after having
been sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, duly addressed to the Party concerned at the address indicated below

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.9

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 15,
2004, between Orion HealthCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with an executive
office located at 10700 Richmond Avenue, Suite 300, Houston, Texas 77042
(together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement, the
"Company"), and Keith G. LeBlanc, who resides at the address set forth on
Schedule I hereto (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into an employment
arrangement; and

      WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement setting forth the
obligations and duties of both the Company and the Executive; and

      WHEREAS, the Company wishes to assure itself of the services of the
Executive for the period hereinafter provided, and the Executive is willing to
be employed by the Company for said period, upon the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is mutually acknowledged, the Company and the Executive (individually, a
"Party" and together, the "Parties") agree as follows:

      1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive hereby agrees to serve the Company, on the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

      2. Term. Subject to the provisions for earlier termination as hereinafter
provided, the term of this Employment Agreement will begin on the date hereof
and will continue for five (5) years hereafter (the "Initial Term of
Employment"). This Agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of the
Initial Term of Employment and each successive renewal term thereafter for
successive two (2) year terms unless either party sends written notice of
termination to the other party not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days
prior to the expiration of the then current Term of Employment (as hereinafter
defined). The Initial Term of Employment together with any renewal terms is
referred to herein as the "Term of Employment." The nonrenewal of the term of
this Agreement by the Company will not be a termination without Cause (as
defined in Section 8(c)).

      3. Position and Duties; Place of Performance.

            (a) The Executive will serve as President of the Company and will
      perform all duties customarily attendant to the position of President and
      such other duties as may reasonably be assigned from time-to-time by the
      Board of Directors (the "Board") that are

<PAGE>

      consistent with his position as President. The Executive will report
      solely to the Board or any subcommittees thereof.

            (b) The Executive will devote his full business time and best
      efforts to his employment and perform diligently such duties as are
      consistent with his capacity as President of the Company and such other
      duties as the Board reasonably determines that are consistent with his
      position. The Executive will devote his entire working time and attention
      to the performance of his responsibilities hereunder; provided, the
      Executive may make personal investments, engage in outside non-competitive
      business activities or engage in other activities for any charitable or
      other non-profit institution, provided that such activities do not
      interfere with the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder.

            (c) In connection with the Executive's employment by the Company,
      the Executive will be based at the Company's place of business which on
      the date hereof is located in Houston, Texas, or such other location as
      may, subject to Section 8(d), be designated from time to time by the
      Board.

      4. Base Salary. The Executive will receive from the Company an annual base
salary of Two Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($240,000) (as from time to time
adjusted, the "Base Salary"), payable in accordance with the standard practice
of the Company with respect to the payment of salaries of its employees. The
Board will review the Base Salary annually, and may, in its reasonable
discretion, adjust the Base Salary.

      5. Annual Bonus. The Executive may be paid a bonus annually based upon the
attainment of objectives determined by the Board after consultation with the
Executive. Within 90 days after the start of each fiscal year, the Board will
communicate to the Executive the objectives applicable to such fiscal year and,
unless the Board and the Executive shall mutually agree otherwise, such
objectives shall apply to such fiscal year.

      6. Other Benefits.

            (a) During the Term of Employment, the Executive will be provided
      with such medical, hospitalization, insurance, pension plan, profit
      sharing and employee benefits, cell phone and such other similar
      employment privileges and benefits ("Benefits") as are afforded generally
      from time to time to other executive employees of the Company, and four
      (4) weeks paid vacation each year.

            (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall receive
      Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per month (pre-tax) as an automobile
      allowance. The Company shall pay all reasonable maintenance and repair
      expenses with respect to the automobile used primarily for business
      purposes by the Executive, procure and maintain in force collision,
      comprehensive, and liability insurance coverage with respect to the
      automobile, and pay operating expenses with respect to the automobile.

                                       2
<PAGE>

      7. Expense Reimbursement. During the Term of Employment, the Executive
will be entitled to prompt reimbursement by the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in performing services under this
Agreement, upon submission of such accounts and records as may be required under
Company policy.

      8. Termination of Employment. The Executive's employment may be terminated
under the following circumstances:

            (a) Death. The Executive's employment is terminated upon his death.

            (b) Disability. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the
      Company due to illness or other physical or mental disability of the
      Executive, resulting in his inability to perform substantially his duties
      under this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) or more consecutive days
      or for one hundred eighty (180) days in the aggregate during any
      consecutive twelve (12) month period ("Disability").

            (c) Cause. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the
      Company for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company will have
      "Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment upon:

                  (i) the Executive's indictment for any crime involving monies
            or other property or any felony, crime or any offense of moral
            turpitude, or his commission of fraud, embezzlement, theft,
            dishonesty, willful misconduct or deliberate injury to the Company
            or its subsidiaries;

                  (ii) the Executive's intentional or grossly negligent refusal
            or failure to perform his duties or carry out directions of the
            Company's Board, which refusal or failure remains uncured or
            continues more than thirty (30) days after notice from the Company
            specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs
            within such period;

                  (iii) the Executive's breach of any of his fiduciary duties to
            the Company or making of a willful misrepresentation or omission,
            which breach or misrepresentation or omission might reasonably be
            expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business
            and which remains uncured or continues more than thirty (30) days
            after notice from the Company specifying in reasonable detail the
            nature of the breach or misrepresentation or omission, or recurs
            within such period;

                  (iv) the Executive's breach of any material provision of this
            Agreement, which breach, if curable, remains uncured or continues
            more than thirty (30) days after notice from the Company specifying
            in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs within such
            period; or

                                       3
<PAGE>

                  (v) any misappropriation by the Executive of funds or property
            of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.

      Any termination for "Cause" will not be in limitation of any other right
      or remedy the Company may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

            (d) Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment under
      this Agreement for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, the
      Executive will have "Good Reason" to terminate the Executive's employment
      upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances, without the
      Executive's express written consent: (i) a material diminution in the
      Executive's position or authority (except during periods when the
      Executive is unable to perform all or substantially all of the Executive's
      duties and/or responsibilities as a result of the Executive's illness
      (either physical or mental) or other incapacity); (ii) a requirement by
      the Company that the Executive change the Executive's principal place of
      business to a place more than thirty (30) miles from its location on the
      date of this Agreement; (iii) a termination of employment by the Executive
      within ninety (90) days following a Change in Control (as defined below),
      provided, that Good Reason will not exist if the Executive has accepted or
      agreed to continue employment following the Change of Control with the
      surviving or successor entity and such surviving or successor entity has
      agreed to continue or assume this Agreement, provided, further, in the
      event of a Change of Control, the Executive is under no obligation to
      continue or accept employment with the surviving or successor entity and
      may instead elect to terminate his employment for Good Reason upon such
      Change of Control; (iv) a breach of this Agreement by the Company which is
      not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice by the Company; or (v)
      any reduction in the Executive's Base Salary. The Executive's right to
      terminate employment pursuant to this subsection 8(d) will not be affected
      by the Executive's Disability. The Executive's continued employment will
      not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
      circumstance constituting consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect
      to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason; provided, however, that the
      Executive will be deemed to have waived his rights pursuant to
      circumstances constituting Good Reason if he has not provided to the
      Company a Notice of Termination (as defined below) within ninety (90) days
      following his knowledge of the circumstances constituting Good Reason. A
      waiver with respect to the circumstances constituting Good Reason will not
      act as a waiver with respect to other future circumstances constituting
      Good Reason.

            Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive must
      be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the Company in
      accordance with Section 19. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
      Termination" means a notice which indicates the specific termination
      provision in this Agreement relied upon and sets forth in reasonable
      detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
      termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so
      indicated.

            For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" will occur:
      (i) upon the sale or other disposition of 50% or more of the consolidated
      assets of the Company taken

                                       4
<PAGE>

      as a whole; (ii) if shares representing a majority of the voting power of
      the Company are acquired by a person or group (as such term is used in
      Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
      amended) of persons other than the holders of the capital stock of the
      Company as of the date of this Agreement; (iii) upon a merger or
      consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the equity securities of
      the Company before the merger or consolidation do not own equity
      securities representing a majority of the voting power of the surviving
      entity after the merger or consolidation; or (iv) upon approval by the
      shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of
      the Company.

      9. Compensation Upon Termination.

            (a) If the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of the
      Executive's death or Disability, he, or his estate, will be entitled to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            but not yet paid, payable as soon as administratively feasible
            following termination of employment;

                  (iii) a prorated bonus for the year in which his employment
            terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked, minus any
            bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement in
            respect of the year containing the date of termination, payable as
            soon as administratively feasible following the end of the then
            current fiscal year of the Company;

                  (iv) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable
            as soon as administratively feasible following termination of
            employment; and

                  (v) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive through
            the date of his death or Disability in accordance with applicable
            plans and programs of the Company.

            (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for
      Cause, or by the Executive other than for Good Reason, or as a result of
      notice of nonrenewal provided by the Company or the Executive under
      Section 2, he will be entitled to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable
            as soon as administratively feasible following termination of
            employment;

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (iii) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive
            through the date of his termination in accordance with applicable
            plans and programs of the Company;

                  (iv) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result
            of notice of nonrenewal provided by the Executive under Section 2,
            he will be entitled to a prorated bonus for the year in which his
            employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked,
            minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of
            the then current fiscal year of the Company; and

                  (v) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of
            notice of nonrenewal provided by the Company under Section 2, he
            will be entitled to full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
      without Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, he will be entitled
      to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            but not yet paid, payable as soon as administratively feasible
            following termination of employment;

                  (iii) continuation of his Base Salary, at the rate in effect
            on the date of his termination of employment (which, in the case of
            a termination of the Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section
            8(d)(v), shall be deemed to be the rate in effect prior to giving
            any effect to the reduction in Base Salary giving rise to such Good
            Reason), until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period (as
            defined below);

                  (iv) the greater of: (A) a prorated bonus for the year in
            which employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days
            worked, or (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average
            of the bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            during the two (2) calendar years preceding such termination, if
            any, minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable in either event as soon as administratively feasible
            following the end of the then fiscal year of the Company; provided,
            however, that this clause (iv) shall not be applicable in the event
            that the Executive's employment is terminated upon notice of
            nonrenewal provided by the Company under Section 2;

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (v) until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
            subject to any employee contribution applicable to the Executive on
            the date of termination, continued participation in all of the
            Company's group medical and dental insurance plans in which he was
            participating on the date of his termination of employment, provided
            that the Executive is entitled to continue such participation under
            applicable law and plan terms;

                  (vi) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expenses incurred by the Executive but not yet paid to him
            on the date of his termination of employment, payable as soon as
            administratively feasible following termination of employment; and

                  (vii) full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            In the event that, under the terms of any employee benefit plan
      referred to in subsection 9(c)(v) above, the Executive may not continue
      his participation, he will be provided with the after-tax economic
      equivalent of the benefits provided under any plan in which he was
      previously eligible to participate for the period specified in subsection
      9(c)(v) above. The economic equivalent of any benefit foregone will be
      deemed to be the cost that would be incurred by the Executive in obtaining
      such benefit on the lowest available individual basis.

            (d) Any amounts due under this Section 9 are in the nature of
      severance payments or liquidated damages or both, and will fully
      compensate the Executive and his dependents or beneficiaries, as the case
      may be, for any and all direct damages and consequential damages that any
      of them may suffer as a result of termination of the Executive's
      employment, and they are not in the nature of a penalty.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, any obligation of the
      Company to the Executive under Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vii) is
      conditioned upon (i) the Executive signing a release of claims in the form
      attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Employee Release") within twenty-one
      days (or such greater period as the Company may specify) following the
      later of the date on which the Executive (or, in the case of termination
      by the Executive for Good Reason, the Company) receives notice of
      termination of employment or the date the Executive receives a copy of the
      Employee Release and upon the Executive not revoking the Employee Release
      in a timely manner thereafter and (ii) the Executive's continuing
      compliance with the provisions of Section 10. If the Executive breaches
      any provision of Section 10, upon written notice of such breach and
      request for repayment from the Company, the Executive shall promptly pay
      to the Company an amount equal to the sum of any cash payments previously
      paid to the Executive pursuant to Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vii).
      Any such repayment shall not be the exclusive remedy for any such breach
      and the Company shall retain all rights to pursue other available remedies
      (whether at law or equity) for any such breach.

                                       7

      10. Confidentiality and Non-Competition.

            (a) The Executive acknowledges that he has had or will have
      unlimited access to confidential information and business methods relating
      to the Company's business and operations and that the Company would be
      irreparably injured and the goodwill of the Company would be irreparably
      damaged if the Executive were to breach the covenants set forth in this
      Section 10. The Executive further acknowledges that the covenants set
      forth in this Section 10 are reasonable in scope and duration and do not
      unreasonably restrict the Executive's association with other business
      entities, either as an employee or otherwise as set forth herein.

            (b) During the Term of Employment and thereafter, except as may be
      required by law or necessary in connection with any dealings with any
      public agency or authority or in the ordinary course of business during
      the Term of Employment pursuant to customary non-disclosure agreements,
      the Executive will not disclose, disseminate, divulge, discuss, copy or
      otherwise use or suffer to be used, including but not limited to in
      competition with, or in a manner harmful to the interests of, the Company,
      any confidential information (written or oral) respecting any material
      aspect of the Company's business, excepting only use of such data or
      information as is (i) at the time disclosed, through no act or failure to
      act on the part of the Executive, generally known or available; (ii)
      furnished to the Executive by a third party as a matter of right and
      without restriction on disclosure; or (iii) required to be disclosed by
      court order. Upon termination of the Term of Employment, the Executive
      will return to the Company any and all materials in tangible or electronic
      form containing confidential information belonging to the Company.

            (c) During the Term of Employment and the Non-Competition Period,
      the Executive will not in the states of California, Florida, Georgia,
      Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio or Texas, directly or indirectly, whether
      as an individual on the Executive's own account, or as a shareholder,
      partner, member, joint venturer, director, officer, employee, consultant,
      creditor and/or agent, of any person, firm or organization or otherwise:

                  (i) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership,
            management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise
            affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or
            otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
            firm, association or other business entity or otherwise engage in
            any business that is engaged in the business of the Company or any
            of the Company's subsidiaries (collectively, "Subsidiaries"), as
            such business is conducted on the applicable date during the Term of
            Employment, or in the case of the Non-Competition Period, as of the
            date the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company, in any
            capacity, including as a consultant;

                  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any
            person who is a present or future employee, officer, agent,
            affiliate or customer of the Company or

                                       8
<PAGE>

            any Subsidiary to terminate or materially alter such person's
            relationship with the Company or such Subsidiary;

                  (iii) induce any supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary, to
            refuse to do business with the Company or any Subsidiary, on as
            favorable terms as previously done with the Company or any
            Subsidiary, as the case may be; or

                  (iv) engage in disparagement (which will not include the
            providing of accurate information without invidious intent) of the
            Company or any Subsidiary by any means to any person.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Competition Period" shall mean the
      period during the Term of Employment and thereafter until the second
      anniversary of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with
      the Company; provided, however, that the Company may, by written notice to
      the Executive (whether given before or after the date of termination of
      the Executive's employment with the Company), shorten the portion of the
      Non-Competition Period occurring following the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with the Company to any date specified in such
      notice which occurs on or after the earlier of (x) the second anniversary
      of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with the Company
      and (y) the date of expiration of the then current Term of Employment.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or the
      Executive provides notice of nonrenewal under Section 2, then: (1) the
      Company shall have the option to continue to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of his termination of
      employment, until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period; (2) if the
      Company exercises such option, it may discontinue the payment of Base
      Salary at any time; (3) the Executive shall be subject to Section 10(c)(i)
      only for so long as the Company continues to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary; and (4) if the Company stops paying the Executive his Base Salary,
      then the Executive shall no longer be subject to Section 10(c)(i), but
      shall remain subject to the rest of this Section 10.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive
      will be permitted to own shares of any class of capital stock of any
      publicly held corporation so long as the aggregate holdings of the
      Executive represent less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
      of such class of capital stock.

      11. Rights and Remedies Upon Breach.

            (a) The Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy
      at law for any breach by the Executive of Section 10 will be inadequate
      and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible
      to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that
      upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of Section 10, the
      Company will be entitled, among other remedies, to injunctive relief and
      may obtain a temporary restraining order restraining any threatened or
      further breach. Nothing in this Section 11(a) will be deemed to limit the
      Company's

                                       9
<PAGE>

      remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the Executive of any of the
      provisions of this Agreement which may be pursued or availed of by the
      Company.

            (b) In the event any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
      the specified time period or geographical area set forth in Section 10 is
      unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
      period or geographical area that is determined by the court to be
      reasonable, non-arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced.

      12. Withholding Taxes. All payments to the Executive or his beneficiary
will be subject to withholding on account of federal, state and local taxes as
required by law. If any payment hereunder is insufficient to provide the amount
of such taxes required to be withheld, the Company may withhold such taxes from
any other payment due the Executive or his beneficiary.

      13. Assignability; Binding Nature. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs (in
the case of the Executive) and assigns. No rights or obligations of the Company
under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company except that
such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant to (i) a
merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the continuing entity or
(ii) a sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and such assignee or transferee
assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, as contained in
this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. The Company further
agrees that, in the event of a sale of assets or liquidation as described in the
preceding sentence, it will use its best efforts to cause such assignee or
transferee to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Company hereunder. No obligations of the Executive under this Agreement may be
assigned or transferred by the Executive.

      14. Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties
concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof.

      15. Amendment or Waiver. No provision in this Agreement may be amended
unless such amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by both the Executive
and an authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by either Party of any
breach by the other Party of any condition or provision contained in this
Agreement to be performed by such other Party will be deemed a waiver of a
similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or
subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the Executive or an
authorized officer of the Company, as the case may be.

      16. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole
or in part, the remaining

                                       10
<PAGE>

provisions of this Agreement will be unaffected thereby and will remain in full
force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

      17. Survivorship. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder will survive any termination of the Executive's employment with the
Company to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations as described in this Agreement.

      18. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and

<PAGE>

                                                                  EXHIBIT 10.10

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 15,
2004, between Orion HealthCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with an executive
office located at 1805 Old Alabama Road, Suite 350, Roswell, Georgia 30076
(together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement, the
"Company"), and Stephen H. Murdock, who resides at the address set forth on
Schedule I hereto (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into an employment
arrangement; and

      WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement setting forth the
obligations and duties of both the Company and the Executive; and

      WHEREAS, the Company wishes to assure itself of the services of the
Executive for the period hereinafter provided, and the Executive is willing to
be employed by the Company for said period, upon the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is mutually acknowledged, the Company and the Executive (individually, a
"Party" and together, the "Parties") agree as follows:

      1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive hereby agrees to serve the Company, on the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

      2. Term. Subject to the provisions for earlier termination as hereinafter
provided, the term of this Employment Agreement will begin on the date hereof
and will continue for five (5) years hereafter (the "Initial Term of
Employment"). This Agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of the
Initial Term of Employment and each successive renewal term thereafter for
successive two (2) year terms unless either party sends written notice of
termination to the other party not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days
prior to the expiration of the then current Term of Employment (as hereinafter
defined). The Initial Term of Employment together with any renewal terms is
referred to herein as the "Term of Employment." The nonrenewal of the term of
this Agreement by the Company will not be a termination without Cause (as
defined in Section 8(c)).

      3. Position and Duties; Place of Performance.

            (a) The Executive will serve as Chief Financial Officer of the
      Company and will perform all duties customarily attendant to the position
      of Chief Financial Officer and such other duties as may reasonably be
      assigned from time-to-time by the Board of Directors (the "Board") that
      are consistent with his position as Chief Financial Officer.

<PAGE>

            (b) The Executive will devote his full business time and best
      efforts to his employment and perform diligently such duties as are
      consistent with his capacity as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and
      such other duties as the Board reasonably determines that are consistent
      with his position. The Executive will devote his entire working time and
      attention to the performance of his responsibilities hereunder; provided,
      the Executive may make personal investments, engage in outside
      non-competitive business activities or engage in other activities for any
      charitable or other non-profit institution, provided that such activities
      do not interfere with the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder.

            (c) In connection with the Executive's employment by the Company,
      the Executive will be based at the Company's place of business which on
      the date hereof is located in Atlanta, Georgia, or such other location as
      may, subject to Section 8(d), be designated from time to time by the
      Board.

      4. Base Salary. The Executive will receive from the Company an annual base
salary of One Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($175,000) (as from time to
time adjusted, the "Base Salary"), payable in accordance with the standard
practice of the Company with respect to the payment of salaries of its
employees. The Board will review the Base Salary annually, and may, in its
reasonable discretion, adjust the Base Salary.

      5. Annual Bonus. The Executive may be paid a bonus annually based upon the
attainment of objectives determined by the Board after consultation with the
Executive. Within 90 days after the start of each fiscal year, the Board will
communicate to the Executive the objectives applicable to such fiscal year and,
unless the Board and the Executive shall mutually agree otherwise, such
objectives shall apply to such fiscal year.

      6. Other Benefits.

            (a) During the Term of Employment, the Executive will be provided
      with such medical, hospitalization, insurance, pension plan, profit
      sharing and employee benefits, cell phone and such other similar
      employment privileges and benefits ("Benefits") as are afforded generally
      from time to time to other executive employees of the Company, and four
      (4) weeks paid vacation each year.

            (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall receive
      Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per month (pre-tax) as an automobile
      allowance. The Company shall pay all reasonable maintenance and repair
      expenses with respect to the automobile used primarily for business
      purposes by the Executive, procure and maintain in force collision,
      comprehensive, and liability insurance coverage with respect to the
      automobile, and pay operating expenses with respect to the automobile.

      7. Expense Reimbursement. During the Term of Employment, the Executive
will be entitled to prompt reimbursement by the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses

                                       2

incurred by him in performing services under this Agreement, upon submission of
such accounts and records as may be required under Company policy.

      8. Termination of Employment. The Executive's employment may be terminated
under the following circumstances:

            (a) Death. The Executive's employment is terminated upon his death.

            (b) Disability. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the
      Company due to illness or other physical or mental disability of the
      Executive, resulting in his inability to perform substantially his duties
      under this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) or more consecutive days
      or for one hundred eighty (180) days in the aggregate during any
      consecutive twelve (12) month period ("Disability").

            (c) Cause. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the
      Company for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company will have
      "Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment upon:

                  (i) the Executive's indictment for any crime involving monies
            or other property or any felony, crime or any offense of moral
            turpitude, or his commission of fraud, embezzlement, theft,
            dishonesty, willful misconduct or deliberate injury to the Company
            or its subsidiaries;

                  (ii) the Executive's intentional or grossly negligent refusal
            or failure to perform his duties or carry out directions of the
            Company's chief executive officer or Board, which refusal or failure
            remains uncured or continues more than thirty (30) days after notice
            from the Company specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the
            breach, or recurs within such period;

                  (iii) the Executive's breach of any of his fiduciary duties to
            the Company or making of a willful misrepresentation or omission,
            which breach or misrepresentation or omission might reasonably be
            expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business
            and which remains uncured or continues more than thirty (30) days
            after notice from the Company specifying in reasonable detail the
            nature of the breach or misrepresentation or omission, or recurs
            within such period;

                  (iv) the Executive's breach of any material provision of this
            Agreement, which breach, if curable, remains uncured or continues
            more than thirty (30) days after notice from the Company specifying
            in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs within such
            period; or

                  (v) any misappropriation by the Executive of funds or property
            of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.

                                       3

      Any termination for "Cause" will not be in limitation of any other right
      or remedy the Company may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

            (d) Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment under
      this Agreement for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, the
      Executive will have "Good Reason" to terminate the Executive's employment
      upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances, without the
      Executive's express written consent: (i) a material diminution in the
      Executive's position or authority (except during periods when the
      Executive is unable to perform all or substantially all of the Executive's
      duties and/or responsibilities as a result of the Executive's illness
      (either physical or mental) or other incapacity); (ii) a requirement by
      the Company that the Executive change the Executive's principal place of
      business to a place more than thirty (30) miles from its location on the
      date of this Agreement; (iii) a termination of employment by the Executive
      within ninety (90) days following a Change in Control (as defined below),
      provided, that Good Reason will not exist if the Executive has accepted or
      agreed to continue employment following the Change of Control with the
      surviving or successor entity and such surviving or successor entity has
      agreed to continue or assume this Agreement, provided, further, in the
      event of a Change of Control, the Executive is under no obligation to
      continue or accept employment with the surviving or successor entity and
      may instead elect to terminate his employment for Good Reason upon such
      Change of Control; (iv) a breach of this Agreement by the Company which is
      not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice by the Company; or (v)
      any reduction in the Executive's Base Salary. The Executive's right to
      terminate employment pursuant to this subsection 8(d) will not be affected
      by the Executive's Disability. The Executive's continued employment will
      not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
      circumstance constituting consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect
      to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason; provided, however, that the
      Executive will be deemed to have waived his rights pursuant to
      circumstances constituting Good Reason if he has not provided to the
      Company a Notice of Termination (as defined below) within ninety (90) days
      following his knowledge of the circumstances constituting Good Reason. A
      waiver with respect to the circumstances constituting Good Reason will not
      act as a waiver with respect to other future circumstances constituting
      Good Reason.

            Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive must
      be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the Company in
      accordance with Section 19. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
      Termination" means a notice which indicates the specific termination
      provision in this Agreement relied upon and sets forth in reasonable
      detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
      termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so
      indicated.

            For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" will occur:
      (i) upon the sale or other disposition of 50% or more of the consolidated
      assets of the Company taken as a whole; (ii) if shares representing a
      majority of the voting power of the Company are acquired by a person or
      group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of persons other than the holders of the

                                       4
<PAGE>

      capital stock of the Company as of the date of this Agreement; (iii) upon
      a merger or consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the equity
      securities of the Company before the merger or consolidation do not own
      equity securities representing a majority of the voting power of the
      surviving entity after the merger or consolidation; or (iv) upon approval
      by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or
      dissolution of the Company.

      9. Compensation Upon Termination.

            (a) If the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of the
      Executive's death or Disability, he, or his estate, will be entitled to:

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement

            terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked, minus any
            bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement in
            respect of the year containing the date of termination, payable as
            soon as administratively feasible following the end of the then
            current fiscal year of the Company;

                  (iv) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable
            as soon as administratively feasible following termination of
            employment; and

                  (v) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive through
            the date of his death or Disability in accordance with applicable
            plans and programs of the Company.

            (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for
      Cause, or by the Executive other than for Good Reason, or as a result of
      notice of nonrenewal provided by the Company or the Executive under
      Section 2, he will be entitled to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable
            as soon as administratively feasible following termination of
            employment;

                  (iii) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (iv) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result
            of notice of nonrenewal provided by the Executive under Section 2,
            he will be entitled to a prorated bonus for the year in which his
            employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked,
            minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of
            the then current fiscal year of the Company; and

                  (v) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of
            notice of nonrenewal provided by the Company under Section 2, he
            will be entitled to full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
      without Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, he will be entitled
      to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            but not yet paid, payable as soon as administratively feasible
            following termination of employment;

                  (iii) continuation of his Base Salary, at the rate in effect
            on the date of his termination of employment (which, in the case of
            a termination of the Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section
            8(d)(v), shall be deemed to be the rate in effect prior to giving
            any effect to the reduction in Base Salary giving rise to such Good
            Reason), until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period (as
            defined below);

                  (iv) the greater of: (A) a prorated bonus for the year in
            which employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days
            worked, or (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average
            of the bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            during the two (2) calendar years preceding such termination, if
            any, minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable in either event as soon as administratively feasible
            following the end of the then fiscal year of the Company; provided,
            however, that this clause (iv) shall not be applicable in the event
            that the Executive's employment is terminated upon notice of
            nonrenewal provided by the Company under Section 2;

                  (v) until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
            subject to any employee contribution applicable to the Executive on
            the date of termination, continued participation in all of the
            Company's group medical and dental insurance plans in which he was
            participating on the date of his termination of

                                       6
<PAGE>

            employment, provided that the Executive is entitled to continue such
            participation under applicable law and plan terms;

                  (vi) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expenses incurred by the Executive but not yet paid to him
            on the date of his termination of employment, payable as soon as
            administratively feasible following termination of employment; and

                  (vii) full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            In the event that, under the terms of any employee benefit plan
      referred to in subsection 9(c)(v) above, the Executive may not continue
      his participation, he will be provided with the after-tax economic
      equivalent of the benefits provided under any plan in which he was
      previously eligible to participate for the period specified in subsection
      9(c)(v) above. The economic equivalent of any benefit foregone will be
      deemed to be the cost that would be incurred by the Executive in obtaining
      such benefit on the lowest available individual basis.

            (d) Any amounts due under this Section 9 are in the nature of
      severance payments or liquidated damages or both, and will fully
      compensate the Executive and his dependents or beneficiaries, as the case
      may be, for any and all direct damages and consequential damages that any
      of them may suffer as a result of termination of the Executive's
      employment, and they are not in the nature of a penalty.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, any obligation of the
      Company to the Executive under Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vii) is
      conditioned upon (i) the Executive signing a release of claims in the form
      attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Employee Release") within twenty-one
      days (or such greater period as the Company may specify) following the
      later of the date on which the Executive (or, in the case of termination
      by the Executive for Good Reason, the Company) receives notice of
      termination of employment or the date the Executive receives a copy of the
      Employee Release and upon the Executive not revoking the Employee Release
      in a timely manner thereafter and (ii) the Executive's continuing
      compliance with the provisions of Section 10. If the Executive breaches
      any provision of Section 10, upon written notice of such breach and
      request for repayment from the Company, the Executive shall promptly pay
      to the Company an amount equal to the sum of any cash payments previously
      paid to the Executive pursuant to Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vii).
      Any such repayment shall not be the exclusive remedy for any such breach
      and the Company shall retain all rights to pursue other available remedies
      (whether at law or equity) for any such breach.

      10. Confidentiality and Non-Competition.

            (a) The Executive acknowledges that he has had or will have
      unlimited access to confidential information and business methods relating
      to the Company's business and

                                       7
<PAGE>

      operations and that the Company would be irreparably injured and the
      goodwill of the Company would be irreparably damaged if the Executive were
      to breach the covenants set forth in this Section 10. The Executive
      further acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this Section 10 are
      reasonable in scope and duration and do not unreasonably restrict the
      Executive's association with other business entities, either as an
      employee or otherwise as set forth herein.

            (b) During the Term of Employment and thereafter, except as may be
      required by law or necessary in connection with any dealings with any
      public agency or authority or in the ordinary course of business during
      the Term of Employment pursuant to customary non-disclosure agreements,
      the Executive will not disclose, disseminate, divulge, discuss, copy or
      otherwise use or suffer to be used, including but not limited to in
      competition with, or in a manner harmful to the interests of, the Company,
      any confidential information (written or oral) respecting any material
      aspect of the Company's business, excepting only use of such data or
      information as is (i) at the time disclosed, through no act or failure to
      act on the part of the Executive, generally known or available; (ii)
      furnished to the Executive by a third party as a matter of right and
      without restriction on disclosure; or (iii) required to be disclosed by
      court order. Upon termination of the Term of Employment, the Executive
      will return to the Company any and all materials in tangible or electronic
      form containing confidential information belonging to the Company.

            (c) During the Term of Employment and the Non-Competition Period,
      the Executive will not in the states of California, Florida, Georgia,
      Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio or Texas, directly or indirectly, whether
      as an individual on the Executive's own account, or as a shareholder,
      partner, member, joint venturer, director, officer, employee, consultant,
      creditor and/or agent, of any person, firm or organization or otherwise:

                  (i) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership,
            management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise
            affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or
            otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
            firm, association or other business entity or otherwise engage in
            any business that is engaged in the business of the Company or any
            of the Company's subsidiaries (collectively, "Subsidiaries"), as
            such business is conducted on the applicable date during the Term of
            Employment, or in the case of the Non-Competition Period, as of the
            date the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company, in any
            capacity, including as a consultant;

                  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any
            person who is a present or future employee, officer, agent,
            affiliate or customer of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate
            or materially alter such person's relationship with the Company or
            such Subsidiary;

                                       8
<PAGE>

                  (iii) induce any supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary, to
            refuse to do business with the Company or any Subsidiary, on as
            favorable terms as previously done with the Company or any
            Subsidiary, as the case may be; or

                  (iv) engage in disparagement (which will not include the
            providing of accurate information without invidious intent) of the
            Company or any Subsidiary by any means to any person.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Competition Period" shall mean the
      period during the Term of Employment and thereafter until the second
      anniversary of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with
      the Company; provided, however, that the Company may, by written notice to
      the Executive (whether given before or after the date of termination of
      the Executive's employment with the Company), shorten the portion of the
      Non-Competition Period occurring following the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with the Company to any date specified in such
      notice which occurs on or after the earlier of (x) the second anniversary
      of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with the Company
      and (y) the date of expiration of the then current Term of Employment.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or the
      Executive provides notice of nonrenewal under Section 2, then: (1) the
      Company shall have the option to continue to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of his termination of
      employment, until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period; (2) if the
      Company exercises such option, it may discontinue the payment of Base
      Salary at any time; (3) the Executive shall be subject to Section 10(c)(i)
      only for so long as the Company continues to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary; and (4) if the Company stops paying the Executive his Base Salary,
      then the Executive shall no longer be subject to Section 10(c)(i), but
      shall remain subject to the rest of this Section 10.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive
      will be permitted to own shares of any class of capital stock of any
      publicly held corporation so long as the aggregate holdings of the
      Executive represent less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
      of such class of capital stock.

      11. Rights and Remedies Upon Breach.

            (a) The Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy
      at law for any breach by the Executive of Section 10 will be inadequate
      and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible
      to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that
      upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of Section 10, the
      Company will be entitled, among other remedies, to injunctive relief and
      may obtain a temporary restraining order restraining any threatened or
      further breach. Nothing in this Section 11(a) will be deemed to limit the
      Company's remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the Executive of
      any of the provisions of this Agreement which may be pursued or availed of
      by the Company.

                                       9
<PAGE>

            (b) In the event any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
      the specified time period or geographical area set forth in Section 10 is
      unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
      period or geographical area that is determined by the court to be
      reasonable, non-arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced.

      12. Withholding Taxes. All payments to the Executive or his beneficiary
will be subject to withholding on account of federal, state and local taxes as
required by law. If any payment hereunder is insufficient to provide the amount
of such taxes required to be withheld, the Company may withhold such taxes from
any other payment due the Executive or his beneficiary.

      13. Assignability; Binding Nature. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs (in
the case of the Executive) and assigns. No rights or obligations of the Company
under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company except that
such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant to (i) a
merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the continuing entity or
(ii) a sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and such assignee or transferee
assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, as contained in
this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. The Company further
agrees that, in the event of a sale of assets or liquidation as described in the
preceding sentence, it will use its best efforts to cause such assignee or
transferee to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Company hereunder. No obligations of the Executive under this Agreement may be
assigned or transferred by the Executive.

      14. Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties
concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof.

      15. Amendment or Waiver. No provision in this Agreement may be amended
unless such amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by both the Executive
and an authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by either Party of any
breach by the other Party of any condition or provision contained in this
Agreement to be performed by such other Party will be deemed a waiver of a
similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or
subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the Executive or an
authorized officer of the Company, as the case may be.

      16. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole
or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unaffected
thereby and will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

                                       10
<PAGE>

      17. Survivorship. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder will survive any termination of the Executive's employment with the
Company to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations as described in this Agreement.

      18. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without
reference to principles of conflict of laws.

      19. Notices. Any notice given to either Party must be in writing and will
be deemed to have been given when delivered personally or one (1) day after
having been sent by overnight courier service or three (3) days after having
been sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, duly addressed to the Party concerned at the address indicated below

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 15,
2004, between Orion HealthCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with an executive
office located at 10700 Richmond Avenue, Suite 300, Houston, Texas 77042
(together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement, the
"Company"), Medical Billing Services, Inc., a Texas corporation, with an
executive office located at 10700 Richmond Avenue, Suite 320, Houston, Texas
77042 (together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement,
"Newco"), and Dennis Cain, who resides at the address set forth on Schedule I
hereto (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, the Company, Newco and the Executive desire to enter into an
employment arrangement; and

      WHEREAS, the Company and Newco have determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company, Newco and the stockholders of the Company to enter
into this Agreement setting forth the obligations and duties of each of the
Company, Newco and the Executive; and

      WHEREAS, the Company and Newco wish to assure themselves of the services
of the Executive for the period hereinafter provided, and the Executive is
willing to be employed by Newco for said period, upon the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is mutually acknowledged, the Company, Newco and the Executive
(individually, a "Party" and together, the "Parties") agree as follows:

      1. Employment. Newco hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive hereby agrees to serve Newco, on the terms and conditions set forth
herein. The Executive acknowledges that this Agreement is the only employment
agreement to which he is a party as of the date hereof.

      2. Term. Subject to the provisions for earlier termination as hereinafter
provided, the term of this Employment Agreement will begin on the date hereof
and will continue for five (5) years hereafter (the "Initial Term of
Employment"). This Agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of the
Initial Term of Employment and each successive renewal term thereafter for
successive two (2) year terms unless either party sends written notice of
termination to the other party not less than ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of the then current Term of Employment (as hereinafter defined). The
Initial Term of Employment together with any renewal terms is referred to herein
as the "Term of Employment." The nonrenewal of the term of this Agreement by the

<PAGE>

      3. Position and Duties; Place of Performance.

            (a) The Executive will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Newco and
      will perform all duties customarily attendant to the position of Chief
      Executive Officer and such other duties as may reasonably be assigned from
      time-to-time by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") that
      are consistent with his position as Chief Executive Officer.

            (b) The Executive will devote his full business time and best
      efforts to his employment and perform diligently such duties as are
      consistent with his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Newco and such
      other duties as the Board reasonably determines that are consistent with
      his position. The Executive will devote his entire working time and
      attention to the performance of his responsibilities hereunder; provided,
      the Executive may make personal investments, engage in outside
      non-competitive business activities or engage in other activities for any
      charitable or other non-profit institution, provided that such activities
      do not interfere with the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder.

            (c) In connection with the Executive's employment by Newco, the
      Executive will be based at Newco's place of business which on the date
      hereof is located in Houston, Texas, or such other location as may,
      subject to Section 8(d), be designated from time to time by the Board.

      4. Base Salary. The Executive will receive from Newco or the Company an
annual base salary of One Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($175,000) (as
from time to time adjusted, the "Base Salary"), payable in accordance with the
standard practice of Newco or the Company with respect to the payment of
salaries of its employees. The Board will review the Base Salary annually, and
may, in its reasonable discretion, adjust the Base Salary.

      5. Annual Bonus. (a) General. The Executive may be paid a bonus annually
based upon the attainment of objectives determined by the Board after
consultation with the Executive. Within 90 days after the start of each fiscal
year, the Board will communicate to the Executive the objectives applicable to
such fiscal year and, unless the Board and the Executive shall mutually agree
otherwise, such objectives shall apply to such fiscal year. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, if the Executive is employed by Newco on December 31, 2005,
the Executive shall be entitled to receive a bonus payment equal to 12.5% of the
amount, if any, by which Newco EBITDA for the 2005 fiscal year (on a pro forma
combined basis, assuming that Newco had been formed on December 31, 2004)
exceeds $1,200,000, up to a maximum bonus payment of $175,000; provided,
however, the Executive may elect not to receive a bonus payment with respect to
any fiscal year by providing written notice of such election to the Company at
any time prior to such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, "Newco EBITDA"
shall mean, with respect to a fiscal year of Newco, the sum of (without
duplication) (a) Newco Net Income for such fiscal year and (b) to the extent
Newco Net Income has been reduced thereby, (i) all income taxes of Newco
recorded as a tax provision in accordance with GAAP for such period, (ii) Newco
Interest Expense, (iii) Newco Non-Cash Charges and (iv) all

                                       2
<PAGE>

management fees required to be paid by Newco to the Company, all as determined
in accordance with GAAP. The components of Newco EBITDA will be determined by
the Company's independent auditor in accordance with GAAP, subject to Section
5(c) below.

      (b) Definitions. "Newco Interest Expense" shall mean, with respect to a
fiscal year of Newco, the sum of (without duplication) (a) the aggregate of the
interest expense of Newco for such fiscal year determined in accordance with
GAAP and (b) the interest component of capitalized lease obligations accrued by
Newco during such period as determined in accordance with GAAP, less (c) the
amount of any interest income received by Newco during such fiscal period.

      "Newco Net Income" shall mean, with respect to a fiscal year of Newco, the
aggregate net income (or loss) of Newco for such fiscal year, determined in
accordance with GAAP.

      "Newco Non-Cash Charges" shall mean, with respect to a fiscal year of
Newco, the aggregate depreciation and amortization of Newco reducing Newco Net
Income for such fiscal year (including any depreciation or amortization of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than Newco that was allocated to Newco,
if applicable).

      "GAAP" shall mean United States generally accepted accounting principles
as set forth in the opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles
Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and statements
and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in other such
statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment
of the accounting profession, as in effect for the relevant time period.

      (c) Disputes. The determination of Newco EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2005, and any disputes in respect thereof, shall be handled in the
manner specified in Sections 2.07(a) and (b) of the Amended and Restated
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 16, 2004 among the Company,
DCPS/MBS Acquisition, Inc., Dennis Cain Physician Solutions, Ltd., Medical
Billing Services, Inc. and the sellers party thereto, as amended (the "Merger
Agreement").

      6. Other Benefits.

            (a) During the Term of Employment, the Executive will be provided
      with such medical, hospitalization, insurance, pension plan, equity
      incentive, profit sharing and employee benefits, cell phone and such other
      similar employment privileges and benefits ("Benefits") as are afforded
      generally from time to time to executive employees of the Company, and
      four (4) weeks paid vacation each year.

            (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall receive
      Two Thousand Eighty-Three Dollars and Thirty-Three Cents ($2,083.33) per
      month (pre-tax) as a personal expense allowance.

      7. Expense Reimbursement. During the Term of Employment, the Executive
will be entitled to prompt reimbursement by Newco or the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in performing services under
this Agreement, upon submission of such accounts and records as may be required
under Company policy.

      8. Termination of Employment. The Executive's employment may be terminated
under the following circumstances:

            (a) Death. The Executive's employment is terminated upon his death.

            (b) Disability. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the
      Company due to illness or other physical or mental disability of the
      Executive, resulting in his inability to perform substantially his duties
      under this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) or more consecutive days
      or for one hundred eighty (180) days in the aggregate during any
      consecutive twelve (12) month period ("Disability").

            (c) Cause. The Executive's employment may be terminated by the

            or other property or any felony, crime or any offense of moral
            turpitude, or his commission of fraud, embezzlement, theft,
            dishonesty, willful misconduct or deliberate injury to the Company
            or its subsidiaries;

                  (ii) the Executive's intentional or grossly negligent refusal
            or failure to perform his duties or carry out written directions of

            failure remains uncured or continues more than thirty (30) days
            after written notice from the Company specifying in reasonable
            detail the nature of the breach, or recurs within such period;

                  (iii) the Executive's breach of any of his fiduciary duties to
            Newco or the Company or making of a willful misrepresentation or
            omission, which breach or misrepresentation or omission might
            reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Newco's
            or the Company's business and which remains uncured or continues
            more than thirty (30) days after written notice from the Company
            specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach or
            misrepresentation or omission, or recurs within such period;

                  (iv) the Executive's breach of any material provision of this
            Agreement, which breach, if curable, remains uncured or continues
            more than thirty (30) days after written notice from the Company
            specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs
            within such period; or

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (v) any misappropriation by the Executive of funds or property
            of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.

      Any termination for "Cause" will not be in limitation of any other right
      or remedy the Company or Newco may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

            (d) Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment under
      this Agreement for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, the
      Executive will have "Good Reason" to terminate the Executive's employment
      upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances, without the
      Executive's express written consent: (i) a material diminution in the
      Executive's position or authority (except during periods when the
      Executive is unable to perform all or substantially all of the Executive's
      duties and/or responsibilities as a result of the Executive's illness
      (either physical or mental) or other incapacity); (ii) a requirement by
      the Company that the Executive change the Executive's principal place of
      business to a place more than thirty (30) miles from its location on the
      date of this Agreement; (iii) a termination of employment by the Executive
      within ninety (90) days following a Change in Control (as defined below),
      provided, that Good Reason will not exist if the Executive has accepted or
      agreed to continue employment following the Change of Control with the
      surviving or successor entity and such surviving or successor entity has
      agreed to continue or assume this Agreement, provided, further, in the
      event of a Change of Control, the Executive is under no obligation to
      continue or accept employment with the surviving or successor entity and
      may instead elect to terminate his employment for Good Reason upon such
      Change of Control; (iv) a breach of this Agreement by Newco or the Company
      which is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice by the
      Executive; (v) any reduction in the Executive's Base Salary or any change
      adverse to the Executive in the bonus objectives applicable to a fiscal
      year after the communication of such objectives to the Executive pursuant
      to Section 5(a); or (vi) a failure by the Company (a "Payment Default") to
      pay any amounts due to a DCPS Seller (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
      pursuant to (A) Section 2.07(c) of the Merger Agreement or (B) the DCPS
      Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in either case within 180 days
      of such payment becoming due. The Executive's right to terminate
      employment pursuant to this subsection 8(d) will not be affected by the
      Executive's Disability. The Executive's continued employment will not
      constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
      circumstance constituting consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect
      to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason; provided, however, that the
      Executive will be deemed to have waived his rights pursuant to
      circumstances constituting Good Reason if he has not provided to the
      Company a Notice of Termination (as defined below) within ninety (90) days
      following his knowledge of the circumstances constituting Good Reason. A
      waiver with respect to the circumstances constituting Good Reason will not
      act as a waiver with respect to other future circumstances constituting
      Good Reason.

            Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive must
      be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the Company in
      accordance with Section 19. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
      Termination" means a notice

                                       5
<PAGE>

      which indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement
      relied upon and sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
      circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the
      Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.

            For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" will occur:
      (i) upon the sale or other disposition of 50% or more of the consolidated
      assets of the Company taken as a whole; (ii) if shares representing a
      majority of the voting power of the Company are acquired by a person or
      group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of persons other than the holders of the
      capital stock of the Company as of the date of this Agreement; (iii) upon
      a merger or consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the equity
      securities of the Company before the merger or consolidation do not own
      equity securities representing a majority of the voting power of the
      surviving entity after the merger or consolidation; or (iv) upon approval
      by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or
      dissolution of the Company.

      9. Compensation Upon Termination.

            (a) If the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of the
      Executive's death or Disability, he, or his estate, will be entitled to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            but not yet paid, payable as soon as administratively feasible
            following termination of employment;

                  (iii) a prorated bonus for the year in which his employment
            terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked, minus any
            bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement in
            respect of the year containing the date of termination, payable as
            soon as administratively feasible following the end of the then
            current fiscal year of the Company;

                  (iv) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable
            as soon as administratively feasible following termination of
            employment; and

                  (v) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive through
            the date of his death or Disability in accordance with applicable
            plans and programs of the Company.

            (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for
      Cause, or by the Executive other than for Good Reason, or as a result of
      notice of nonrenewal provided by the Company or the Executive under
      Section 2, he will be entitled to:

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expense incurred by the Executive but not yet paid, payable
            as soon as administratively feasible following termination of
            employment;

                  (iii) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive
            through the date of his termination in accordance with applicable
            plans and programs of the Company;

                  (iv) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result
            of notice of nonrenewal provided by the Executive under Section 2,
            he will be entitled to a prorated bonus for the year in which his
            employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days worked,
            minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of
            the then current fiscal year of the Company; and

                  (v) if the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of
            notice of nonrenewal provided by the Company under Section 2, he
            will be entitled to full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company
      without Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, he will be entitled
      to:

                  (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid;

                  (ii) any bonus awarded pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            but not yet paid, payable as soon as administratively feasible
            following termination of employment;

                  (iii) continuation of his Base Salary, at the rate in effect
            on the date of his termination of employment (which, in the case of
            a termination of the Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section
            8(d)(v), shall be deemed to be the rate in effect prior to giving
            any effect to the reduction in Base Salary giving rise to such Good
            Reason), until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period (as
            defined below);

                  (iv) the greater of: (A) a prorated bonus for the year in
            which employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days
            worked, or (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average
            of the bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            during the two (2) calendar years preceding such termination, if
            any, minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable in

                                       7
<PAGE>

            either event as soon as administratively feasible following the end
            of the then fiscal year of the Company; provided, however, that this
            clause (iv) shall not be applicable in the event that the
            Executive's employment is terminated upon notice of nonrenewal
            provided by the Company under Section 2;

                  (v) until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
            subject to any employee contribution applicable to the Executive on
            the date of termination, continued participation in all of the
            Company's group medical and dental insurance plans in which he was
            participating on the date of his termination of employment, provided
            that the Executive is entitled to continue such participation under
            applicable law and plan terms;

                  (vi) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expenses incurred by the Executive but not yet paid to him
            on the date of his termination of employment, payable as soon as
            administratively feasible following termination of employment; and

                  (vii) full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            In the event that, under the terms of any employee benefit plan
      referred to in subsection 9(c)(v) above, the Executive may not continue
      his participation, he will be provided with the after-tax economic
      equivalent of the benefits provided under any plan in which he was
      previously eligible to participate for the period specified in subsection
      9(c)(v) above. The economic equivalent of any benefit foregone will be
      deemed to be the cost that would be incurred by the Executive in obtaining
      such benefit on the lowest available individual basis.

            (d) Any amounts due under this Section 9 are in the nature of
      severance payments or liquidated damages or both, and, to the extent
      received by the Executive, will fully compensate the Executive and his
      dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, for any and all direct
      damages and consequential damages that any of them may suffer as a result
      of termination of the Executive's employment, and they are not in the
      nature of a penalty.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, any obligation of the
      Company or Newco to the Executive under Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and
      (vii) is conditioned upon (i) the Executive signing a release of claims in
      the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Employee Release") within
      twenty-one days (or such greater period as the Company may specify)
      following the later of the date on which the Executive (or, in the case of
      termination by the Executive for Good Reason, the Company) receives notice
      of termination of employment or the date the Executive receives a copy of
      the Employee Release and upon the Executive not revoking the Employee
      Release in a timely manner thereafter and (ii) the Executive's continuing
      compliance with the provisions of Section 10. If the Executive breaches
      any provision of Section 10, upon written notice of such

                                       8
<PAGE>

      breach and request for repayment from the Company, the Executive shall
      promptly pay to the Company an amount equal to the sum of any cash
      payments previously paid to the Executive pursuant to Sections 9(c)(iii),
      (iv), (v) and (vii). Any such repayment shall not be the exclusive remedy
      for any such breach and the Company and Newco shall retain all rights to
      pursue other available remedies (whether at law or equity) for any such
      breach.

      10. Confidentiality and Non-Competition.

            (a) The Executive acknowledges that he has had or will have
      unlimited access to confidential information and business methods relating
      to the Company's and Newco's business and operations and that the Company
      and Newco would be irreparably injured and the goodwill of the Company and
      Newco would be irreparably damaged if the Executive were to breach the
      covenants set forth in this Section 10. The Executive further acknowledges
      that the covenants set forth in this Section 10 are reasonable in scope
      and duration and do not unreasonably restrict the Executive's association
      with other business entities, either as an employee or otherwise as set
      forth herein.

            (b) During the Term of Employment and thereafter, except as may be
      required by law or necessary in connection with any dealings with any
      public agency or authority or in the ordinary course of business during
      the Term of Employment pursuant to customary non-disclosure agreements,
      the Executive will not disclose, disseminate, divulge, discuss, copy or
      otherwise use or suffer to be used, including but not limited to in
      competition with, or in a manner harmful to the interests of, the Company
      or Newco, any confidential information (written or oral) respecting any
      material aspect of the Company's or Newco's business, excepting only use
      of such data or information as is (i) at the time disclosed, through no
      act or failure to act on the part of the Executive, generally known or
      available; (ii) furnished to the Executive by a third party as a matter of
      right and without restriction on disclosure; or (iii) required to be
      disclosed by court order. Upon termination of the Term of Employment, the
      Executive will return to the Company any and all materials in tangible or
      electronic form containing confidential information belonging to the
      Company or Newco.

            (c) During the Term of Employment and continuing until the earlier
      of the termination of the Non-Competition Period or the date on which the
      Executive terminates his employment with Newco for Good Reason upon a
      Payment Default, the Executive will not in the states of California,
      Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio or Texas, directly or
      indirectly, whether as an individual on the Executive's own account, or as
      a shareholder, partner, member, joint venturer, director, officer,
      employee, consultant, creditor and/or agent, of any person, firm or
      organization or otherwise:

                  (i) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership,
            management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise
            affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or
            otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
            firm, association or other business entity or otherwise engage in
            any business that is engaged in the business of the Company or any
            of

                                       9
<PAGE>

            the Company's subsidiaries (collectively, "Subsidiaries"), as such
            business is conducted on the applicable date during the Term of
            Employment, or in the case of the Non-Competition Period, as of the
            date the Executive ceases to be employed by Newco, in any capacity,
            including as a consultant;

                  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any
            person who is a present or future employee, officer, agent,
            affiliate or customer of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate
            or materially alter such person's relationship with the Company or
            such Subsidiary;

                  (iii) induce any supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary, to
            refuse to do business with the Company or any Subsidiary, on as
            favorable terms as previously done with the Company or any
            Subsidiary, as the case may be; or

                  (iv) engage in disparagement (which will not include the
            providing of accurate information without invidious intent) of the
            Company or any Subsidiary by any means to any person.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Competition Period" shall mean the
      period during the Term of Employment and thereafter until the second
      anniversary of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with
      Newco; provided, however, that the Company may, by written notice to the
      Executive (whether given before or after the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with Newco), shorten the portion of the
      Non-Competition Period occurring following the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with Newco to any date specified in such notice
      which occurs on or after the earlier of (x) the second anniversary of the
      date of termination of the Executive's employment with Newco and (y) the
      date of expiration of the then current Term of Employment. Notwithstanding
      anything herein to the contrary, the Non-Competition Period shall
      terminate if the Company and Newco fail to pay any amounts due to the
      Executive under this Agreement within sixty (60) days of such payment
      being due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or
      the Executive provides notice of nonrenewal under Section 2, then: (1) the
      Company shall have the option to continue to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of his termination of
      employment, until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period; (2) if the
      Company exercises such option, it may discontinue the payment of Base
      Salary at any time; (3) the Executive shall be subject to Section 10(c)(i)
      only for so long as the Company continues to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary; and (4) if the Company stops paying the Executive his Base Salary,
      then the Executive shall no longer be subject to Section 10(c)(i), but
      shall remain subject to the rest of this Section 10.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive
      will be permitted to own shares of any class of capital stock of any
      publicly held corporation so long as the aggregate holdings of the
      Executive represent less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
      of such class of capital stock.

      11. Rights and Remedies Upon Breach.

            (a) The Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy
      at law for any breach by the Executive of Section 10 will be inadequate
      and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible
      to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that
      upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of Section 10, the
      Company and Newco will be entitled, among other remedies, to injunctive
      relief and may obtain a temporary restraining order restraining any
      threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 11(a) will be deemed
      to limit the Company's or Newco's remedies at law or in equity for any
      breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of this Agreement which
      may be pursued or availed of by the Company or Newco.

            (b) In the event any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
      the specified time period or geographical area set forth in Section 10 is
      unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
      period or geographical area that is determined by the court to be
      reasonable, non-arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced.

      12. Withholding Taxes. All payments to the Executive or his beneficiary
will be subject to withholding on account of federal, state and local taxes as
required by law. If any payment hereunder is insufficient to provide the amount
of such taxes required to be withheld, the Company or Newco may withhold such
taxes from any other payment due the Executive or his beneficiary.

      13. Assignability; Binding Nature. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs (in
the case of the Executive) and assigns. No rights or obligations of the Company
or Newco under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company or
Newco except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred
pursuant to (i) a merger or consolidation in which the Company or Newco is not
the continuing entity or (ii) a sale or liquidation of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company or Newco, provided that the assignee or transferee
is the successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or
Newco, as applicable, and such assignee or transferee assumes the liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Company or Newco, as applicable, as contained in
this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. Each of the Company
and Newco further agrees that, in the event of a sale of assets or liquidation
as described in the preceding sentence, it will use its best efforts to cause
such assignee or transferee to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Company or Newco, as applicable, hereunder. No obligations of the
Executive under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Executive.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
Sellers exercise the ROFR (as defined in Section 6.11 of the Merger Agreement)
and purchase the capital stock or assets of Newco pursuant thereto, this
Agreement shall immediately terminate without further obligation on the part of
any party hereto; provided, however, that the Executive

                                       11
<PAGE>

shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Sections 10(a) and 10(b) with
respect to confidential information of the Company.

      14. Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties
concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof.

      15. Amendment or Waiver. No provision in this Agreement may be amended
unless such amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by both the Executive
and an authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by either Party of any
breach by the other Party of any condition or provision contained in this
Agreement to be performed by such other Party will be deemed a waiver of a
similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or
subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the Executive or an
authorized officer of the Company, as the case may be.

      16. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole
or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unaffected
thereby and will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

      17. Survivorship. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder will survive any termination of the Executive's employment with Newco
to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations as described in this Agreement.

      18. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

      19. Notices. Any notice given to any Party must be in writing and will be
deemed to have been given when delivered personally or one (1) day after having

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 15,
2004, between Orion HealthCorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with an executive
office located at 10700 Richmond Avenue, Suite 300, Houston, Texas 77042
(together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement, the
"Company"), Medical Billing Services, Inc., a Texas corporation, with an
executive office located at 10700 Richmond Avenue, Suite 320, Houston, Texas
77042 (together with its successors and assigns permitted under this Agreement,
"Newco"), and Tom M. Smith, who resides at the address set forth on Schedule I
hereto (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, the Company, Newco and the Executive desire to enter into an
employment arrangement; and

      WHEREAS, the Company and Newco have determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company, Newco and the stockholders of the Company to enter
into this Agreement setting forth the obligations and duties of each of the
Company, Newco and the Executive; and

      WHEREAS, the Company and Newco wish to assure themselves of the services
of the Executive for the period hereinafter provided, and the Executive is
willing to be employed by Newco for said period, upon the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is mutually acknowledged, the Company, Newco and the Executive
(individually, a "Party" and together, the "Parties") agree as follows:

      1. Employment. Newco hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive hereby agrees to serve Newco, on the terms and conditions set forth
herein. The Executive acknowledges that this Agreement is the only employment
agreement to which he is a party as of the date hereof.

      2. Term. Subject to the provisions for earlier termination as hereinafter
provided, the term of this Employment Agreement will begin on the date hereof
and will continue for five (5) years hereafter (the "Initial Term of
Employment"). This Agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of the

      3. Position and Duties; Place of Performance.

            (a) The Executive will serve as President and Chief Operating
      Officer of Newco and will perform all duties customarily attendant to the
      position of President and Chief Operating Officer and such other duties as
      may reasonably be assigned from time-to-time by the Board of Directors of
      the Company (the "Board") that are consistent with his position as
      President and Chief Operating Officer.

            (b) The Executive will devote his full business time and best
      efforts to his employment and perform diligently such duties as are
      consistent with his capacity as President and Chief Operating Officer of
      Newco and such other duties as the Board reasonably determines that are
      consistent with his position. The Executive will devote his entire working
      time and attention to the performance of his responsibilities hereunder;
      provided, the Executive may make personal investments, engage in outside
      non-competitive business activities or engage in other activities for any
      charitable or other non-profit institution, provided that such activities
      do not interfere with the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder.

            (c) In connection with the Executive's employment by Newco, the
      Executive will be based at Newco's place of business which on the date
      hereof is located in Houston, Texas, or such other location as may,
      subject to Section 8(d), be designated from time to time by the Board.

      4. Base Salary. The Executive will receive from Newco or the Company an
annual base salary of One Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($175,000) (as
from time to time adjusted, the "Base Salary"), payable in accordance with the
standard practice of Newco or the Company with respect to the payment of
salaries of its employees. The Board will review the Base Salary annually, and
may, in its reasonable discretion, adjust the Base Salary.

      5. Annual Bonus. (a) General. The Executive may be paid a bonus annually
based upon the attainment of objectives determined by the Board after
consultation with the Executive. Within 90 days after the start of each fiscal
year, the Board will communicate to the Executive the objectives applicable to
such fiscal year and, unless the Board and the Executive shall mutually agree
otherwise, such objectives shall apply to such fiscal year. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, if the Executive is employed by Newco on December 31, 2005,
the Executive shall be entitled to receive a bonus payment equal to 12.5% of the
amount, if any, by which Newco EBITDA for the 2005 fiscal year (on a pro forma
combined basis, assuming that Newco had been formed on December 31, 2004)
exceeds $1,200,000, up to a maximum bonus payment of $175,000; provided,
however, the Executive may elect not to receive a bonus payment with respect to
any fiscal year by providing written notice of such election to the Company at
any time prior to such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, "Newco EBITDA"
shall mean, with respect to a fiscal year of Newco, the sum of (without
duplication) (a) Newco Net Income for such fiscal year and (b) to the extent
Newco Net Income has been reduced thereby, (i) all income taxes of Newco
recorded as a tax provision in accordance with GAAP for

                                       2
<PAGE>

such period, (ii) Newco Interest Expense, (iii) Newco Non-Cash Charges and (iv)
all management fees required to be paid by Newco to the Company, all as
determined in accordance with GAAP. The components of Newco EBITDA will be
determined by the Company's independent auditor in accordance with GAAP, subject
to Section 5(c) below.

      (b) Definitions. "Newco Interest Expense" shall mean, with respect to a
fiscal year of Newco, the sum of (without duplication) (a) the aggregate of the
interest expense of Newco for such fiscal year determined in accordance with
GAAP and (b) the interest component of capitalized lease obligations accrued by
Newco during such period as determined in accordance with GAAP, less (c) the
amount of any interest income received by Newco during such fiscal period.

      "Newco Net Income" shall mean, with respect to a fiscal year of Newco, the
aggregate net income (or loss) of Newco for such fiscal year, determined in
accordance with GAAP.

      "Newco Non-Cash Charges" shall mean, with respect to a fiscal year of
Newco, the aggregate depreciation and amortization of Newco reducing Newco Net
Income for such fiscal year (including any depreciation or amortization of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than Newco that was allocated to Newco,
if applicable).

      "GAAP" shall mean United States generally accepted accounting principles
as set forth in the opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles
Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and statements
and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in other such
statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment
of the accounting profession, as in effect for the relevant time period.

      (c) Disputes. The determination of Newco EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2005, and any disputes in respect thereof, shall be handled in the
manner specified in Sections 2.07(a) and (b) of the Amended and Restated
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 16, 2004 among the Company,
DCPS/MBS Acquisition, Inc., Dennis Cain Physician Solutions, Ltd., Medical
Billing Services, Inc. and the sellers party thereto, as amended (the "Merger
Agreement").

      with such medical, hospitalization, insurance, pension plan, equity
      incentive, profit sharing and employee benefits, cell phone and such other
      similar employment privileges and benefits ("Benefits") as are afforded
      generally from time to time to executive employees of the Company, and

            (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall receive

            turpitude, or his commission of fraud, embezzlement, theft,
            dishonesty, willful misconduct or deliberate injury to the Company
            or its subsidiaries;

                  (ii) the Executive's intentional or grossly negligent refusal
            or failure to perform his duties or carry out written directions of

            after written notice from the Company specifying in reasonable

                  (iii) the Executive's breach of any of his fiduciary duties to
            Newco or the Company or making of a willful misrepresentation or
            omission, which breach or misrepresentation or omission might
            reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Newco's
            or the Company's business and which remains uncured or continues
            more than thirty (30) days after written notice from the Company
            specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach or
            misrepresentation or omission, or recurs within such period;

                  (iv) the Executive's breach of any material provision of this

            more than thirty (30) days after written notice from the Company
            specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, or recurs
            within such period; or

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (v) any misappropriation by the Executive of funds or property
            of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.

      Any termination for "Cause" will not be in limitation of any other right
      or remedy the Company or Newco may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

            (d) Good Reason. The Executive may terminate his employment under
      this Agreement for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, the
      Executive will have "Good Reason" to terminate the Executive's employment
      upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances, without the
      Executive's express written consent: (i) a material diminution in the
      Executive's position or authority (except during periods when the
      Executive is unable to perform all or substantially all of the Executive's
      duties and/or responsibilities as a result of the Executive's illness
      (either physical or mental) or other incapacity); (ii) a requirement by
      the Company that the Executive change the Executive's principal place of
      business to a place more than thirty (30) miles from its location on the
      date of this Agreement; (iii) a termination of employment by the Executive
      within ninety (90) days following a Change in Control (as defined below),
      provided, that Good Reason will not exist if the Executive has accepted or
      agreed to continue employment following the Change of Control with the
      surviving or successor entity and such surviving or successor entity has
      agreed to continue or assume this Agreement, provided, further, in the
      event of a Change of Control, the Executive is under no obligation to
      continue or accept employment with the surviving or successor entity and
      may instead elect to terminate his employment for Good Reason upon such
      Change of Control; (iv) a breach of this Agreement by Newco or the Company
      which is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice by the
      Executive; (v) any reduction in the Executive's Base Salary or any change
      adverse to the Executive in the bonus objectives applicable to a fiscal
      year after the communication of such objectives to the Executive pursuant
      to Section 5(a); or (vi) a failure by the Company (a "Payment Default") to
      pay any amounts due to an MBS Seller (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
      pursuant to (A) Section 2.07(c) of the Merger Agreement or (B) the MBS
      Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in either case within 180 days
      of such payment becoming due. The Executive's right to terminate
      employment pursuant to this subsection 8(d) will not be affected by the
      Executive's Disability. The Executive's continued employment will not
      constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
      circumstance constituting consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect
      to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason; provided, however, that the
      Executive will be deemed to have waived his rights pursuant to
      circumstances constituting Good Reason if he has not provided to the
      Company a Notice of Termination (as defined below) within ninety (90) days
      following his knowledge of the circumstances constituting Good Reason. A
      waiver with respect to the circumstances constituting Good Reason will not
      act as a waiver with respect to other future circumstances constituting
      Good Reason.

            Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive must
      be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the Company in
      accordance with Section 19. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
      Termination" means a notice

                                       5
<PAGE>

      which indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement
      relied upon and sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
      circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the
      Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.

            For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" will occur:
      (i) upon the sale or other disposition of 50% or more of the consolidated
      assets of the Company taken as a whole; (ii) if shares representing a
      majority of the voting power of the Company are acquired by a person or
      group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of persons other than the holders of the
      capital stock of the Company as of the date of this Agreement; (iii) upon
      a merger or consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the equity
      securities of the Company before the merger or consolidation do not own
      equity securities representing a majority of the voting power of the
      surviving entity after the merger or consolidation; or (iv) upon approval
      by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or
      dissolution of the Company.

      9. Compensation Upon Termination.

            (a) If the Executive's employment is terminated as a result of the
      Executive's death or Disability, he, or his estate, will be entitled to:

                  (v) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive through
            the date of his death or Disability in accordance with applicable
            plans and programs of the Company.

            (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for

                  (iii) other benefits accrued and earned by the Executive

            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and

            a termination of the Executive for Good Reason pursuant to Section
            8(d)(v), shall be deemed to be the rate in effect prior to giving
            any effect to the reduction in Base Salary giving rise to such Good
            Reason), until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period (as
            defined below);

                  (iv) the greater of: (A) a prorated bonus for the year in
            which employment terminates, prorated based on the number of days
            worked, or (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average
            of the bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement
            during the two (2) calendar years preceding such termination, if
            any, minus any bonus payments made pursuant to Section 5 of this
            Agreement in respect of the year containing the date of termination,
            payable in

                                       7

            either event as soon as administratively feasible following the end
            of the then fiscal year of the Company; provided, however, that this
            clause (iv) shall not be applicable in the event that the
            Executive's employment is terminated upon notice of nonrenewal
            provided by the Company under Section 2;

                  (v) until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
            subject to any employee contribution applicable to the Executive on
            the date of termination, continued participation in all of the
            Company's group medical and dental insurance plans in which he was
            participating on the date of his termination of employment, provided
            that the Executive is entitled to continue such participation under
            applicable law and plan terms;

                  (vi) reimbursement in accordance with this Agreement of any
            business expenses incurred by the Executive but not yet paid to him
            on the date of his termination of employment, payable as soon as
            administratively feasible following termination of employment; and

                  (vii) full vesting of any unvested equity incentives,
            including without limitation stock options, restricted stock and
            deferred restricted stock units.

            In the event that, under the terms of any employee benefit plan
      referred to in subsection 9(c)(v) above, the Executive may not continue
      his participation, he will be provided with the after-tax economic
      equivalent of the benefits provided under any plan in which he was
      previously eligible to participate for the period specified in subsection
      9(c)(v) above. The economic equivalent of any benefit foregone will be
      deemed to be the cost that would be incurred by the Executive in obtaining
      such benefit on the lowest available individual basis.

            (d) Any amounts due under this Section 9 are in the nature of
      severance payments or liquidated damages or both, and, to the extent
      received by the Executive, will fully compensate the Executive and his
      dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, for any and all direct
      damages and consequential damages that any of them may suffer as a result
      of termination of the Executive's employment, and they are not in the
      nature of a penalty.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, any obligation of the
      Company or Newco to the Executive under Sections 9(c)(iii), (iv), (v) and
      (vii) is conditioned upon (i) the Executive signing a release of claims in
      the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Employee Release") within
      twenty-one days (or such greater period as the Company may specify)
      following the later of the date on which the Executive (or, in the case of
      termination by the Executive for Good Reason, the Company) receives notice
      of termination of employment or the date the Executive receives a copy of
      the Employee Release and upon the Executive not revoking the Employee
      Release in a timely manner thereafter and (ii) the Executive's continuing
      compliance with the provisions of Section 10. If the Executive breaches
      any provision of Section 10, upon written notice of such

                                       8
<PAGE>

      breach and request for repayment from the Company, the Executive shall
      promptly pay to the Company an amount equal to the sum of any cash
      payments previously paid to the Executive pursuant to Sections 9(c)(iii),
      (iv), (v) and (vii). Any such repayment shall not be the exclusive remedy
      for any such breach and the Company and Newco shall retain all rights to
      pursue other available remedies (whether at law or equity) for any such
      breach.

      10. Confidentiality and Non-Competition.

            (a) The Executive acknowledges that he has had or will have
      unlimited access to confidential information and business methods relating
      to the Company's and Newco's business and operations and that the Company
      and Newco would be irreparably injured and the goodwill of the Company and
      Newco would be irreparably damaged if the Executive were to breach the
      covenants set forth in this Section 10. The Executive further acknowledges
      that the covenants set forth in this Section 10 are reasonable in scope
      and duration and do not unreasonably restrict the Executive's association
      with other business entities, either as an employee or otherwise as set
      forth herein.

            (b) During the Term of Employment and thereafter, except as may be
      required by law or necessary in connection with any dealings with any
      public agency or authority or in the ordinary course of business during
      the Term of Employment pursuant to customary non-disclosure agreements,
      the Executive will not disclose, disseminate, divulge, discuss, copy or
      otherwise use or suffer to be used, including but not limited to in
      competition with, or in a manner harmful to the interests of, the Company
      or Newco, any confidential information (written or oral) respecting any
      material aspect of the Company's or Newco's business, excepting only use
      of such data or information as is (i) at the time disclosed, through no
      act or failure to act on the part of the Executive, generally known or
      available; (ii) furnished to the Executive by a third party as a matter of
      right and without restriction on disclosure; or (iii) required to be
      disclosed by court order. Upon termination of the Term of Employment, the
      Executive will return to the Company any and all materials in tangible or
      electronic form containing confidential information belonging to the
      Company or Newco.

            (c) During the Term of Employment and continuing until the earlier
      of the termination of the Non-Competition Period or the date on which the
      Executive terminates his employment with Newco for Good Reason upon a
      Payment Default, the Executive will not in the states of California,
      Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio or Texas, directly or
      indirectly, whether as an individual on the Executive's own account, or as
      a shareholder, partner, member, joint venturer, director, officer,
      employee, consultant, creditor and/or agent, of any person, firm or
      organization or otherwise:

                  (i) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership,
            management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise
            affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or
            otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
            firm, association or other business entity or otherwise engage in
            any business that is engaged in the business of the Company or any
            of

                                       9
<PAGE>

            the Company's subsidiaries (collectively, "Subsidiaries"), as such
            business is conducted on the applicable date during the Term of
            Employment, or in the case of the Non-Competition Period, as of the
            date the Executive ceases to be employed by Newco, in any capacity,
            including as a consultant;

                  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any
            person who is a present or future employee, officer, agent,
            affiliate or customer of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate
            or materially alter such person's relationship with the Company or
            such Subsidiary;

                  (iii) induce any supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary, to
            refuse to do business with the Company or any Subsidiary, on as
            favorable terms as previously done with the Company or any
            Subsidiary, as the case may be; or

                  (iv) engage in disparagement (which will not include the
            providing of accurate information without invidious intent) of the
            Company or any Subsidiary by any means to any person.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Competition Period" shall mean the
      period during the Term of Employment and thereafter until the second
      anniversary of the date of termination of the Executive's employment with
      Newco; provided, however, that the Company may, by written notice to the
      Executive (whether given before or after the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with Newco), shorten the portion of the
      Non-Competition Period occurring following the date of termination of the
      Executive's employment with Newco to any date specified in such notice
      which occurs on or after the earlier of (x) the second anniversary of the
      date of termination of the Executive's employment with Newco and (y) the
      date of expiration of the then current Term of Employment. Notwithstanding
      anything herein to the contrary, the Non-Competition Period shall
      terminate if the Company and Newco fail to pay any amounts due to the
      Executive under this Agreement within sixty (60) days of such payment
      being due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or
      the Executive provides notice of nonrenewal under Section 2, then: (1) the
      Company shall have the option to continue to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of his termination of
      employment, until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period; (2) if the
      Company exercises such option, it may discontinue the payment of Base
      Salary at any time; (3) the Executive shall be subject to Section 10(c)(i)
      only for so long as the Company continues to pay the Executive his Base
      Salary; and (4) if the Company stops paying the Executive his Base Salary,
      then the Executive shall no longer be subject to Section 10(c)(i), but
      shall remain subject to the rest of this Section 10.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive
      will be permitted to own shares of any class of capital stock of any
      publicly held corporation so long as the aggregate holdings of the
      Executive represent less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
      of such class of capital stock.

      11. Rights and Remedies Upon Breach.

            (a) The Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy
      at law for any breach by the Executive of Section 10 will be inadequate
      and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible
      to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that
      upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of Section 10, the
      Company and Newco will be entitled, among other remedies, to injunctive
      relief and may obtain a temporary restraining order restraining any
      threatened or further breach. Nothing in this Section 11(a) will be deemed
      to limit the Company's or Newco's remedies at law or in equity for any
      breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of this Agreement which
      may be pursued or availed of by the Company or Newco.

            (b) In the event any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
      the specified time period or geographical area set forth in Section 10 is
      unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
      period or geographical area that is determined by the court to be
      reasonable, non-arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced.

      12. Withholding Taxes. All payments to the Executive or his beneficiary
will be subject to withholding on account of federal, state and local taxes as
required by law. If any payment hereunder is insufficient to provide the amount
of such taxes required to be withheld, the Company or Newco may withhold such
taxes from any other payment due the Executive or his beneficiary.

      13. Assignability; Binding Nature. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs (in
the case of the Executive) and assigns. No rights or obligations of the Company
or Newco under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company or
Newco except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred
pursuant to (i) a merger or consolidation in which the Company or Newco is not
the continuing entity or (ii) a sale or liquidation of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company or Newco, provided that the assignee or transferee
is the successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or
Newco, as applicable, and such assignee or transferee assumes the liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Company or Newco, as applicable, as contained in
this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. Each of the Company
and Newco further agrees that, in the event of a sale of assets or liquidation
as described in the preceding sentence, it will use its best efforts to cause
such assignee or transferee to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Company or Newco, as applicable, hereunder. No obligations of the
Executive under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Executive.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
Sellers exercise the ROFR (as defined in Section 6.11 of the Merger Agreement)
and purchase the capital stock or assets of Newco pursuant thereto, this
Agreement shall immediately terminate without further obligation on the part of
any party hereto; provided, however, that the Executive shall continue to be
bound by the provisions of Sections 10(a) and 10(b) with respect to confidential
information of the Company.

      14. Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, this
Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties
concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between the Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof.

      15. Amendment or Waiver. No provision in this Agreement may be amended
unless such amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by both the Executive
and an authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by either Party of any
breach by the other Party of any condition or provision contained in this
Agreement to be performed by such other Party will be deemed a waiver of a
similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or
subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the Executive or an
authorized officer of the Company, as the case may be.

      16. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole
or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unaffected
thereby and will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

      17. Survivorship. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder will survive any termination of the Executive's employment with Newco
to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations as described in this Agreement.

      18. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

      19. Notices. Any notice given to any Party must be in writing and will be
deemed to have been given when delivered personally or one (1) day after having
been sent by overnight courier service or three (3) days after having been sent

be delivered to the Company) file with the Commission a Registration Statement
with respect to such Registrable Shares and use its Best Efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective within 60 days after the filing of
such Registration Statement. Such Registration Statement shall be for an
offering to be made on a continuous or delayed basis (a so-called "shelf
registration statement") if (i) the Company is eligible for the use thereof and
(ii) the Holders requesting such registration have asked for a shelf
registration statement, and the Company shall keep such Registration Statement
effective pursuant to Rule 415 for the Effectiveness Period.

         4.2. Amendments and Supplements. The Company will prepare and file with
the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection

Registrable Shares and other securities, if any, covered by such Registration
Statement until the end of the Effectiveness Period.

         4.3. Cooperation. The Company will use its Best Efforts to cooperate
with the Selling Holders in the disposition of the Registrable Shares covered by

customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form with
the managing underwriter) and causing key executives of the Company and its
subsidiaries to participate under the direction of the managing underwriter in a

other documents, in each case, as the Selling Holder may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable
Shares owned by the Selling Holder.

         4.5. Blue Sky Qualification. The Company will use its Best Efforts to
register or qualify the Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statement
under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such states or jurisdictions in the
United States as the Selling Holders reasonably request, and do any and all
other acts and things that may be necessary or desirable to enable the Selling
Holders to consummate the public sale or other disposition in such jurisdictions
of the Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statement, including
preparing and filing in those jurisdictions such amendments (including
post-effective amendments) and supplements to such registrations and
qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof during
the Effectiveness Period (in the case of a shelf

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

registration statement); provided, however, that the Company will not be
obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to
subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in
which it would not otherwise be so subject. The Company shall promptly notify
each Selling Holder of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any
Registrable Shares for sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any
jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

         4.6. Opinion of Counsel; Comfort Letter. In the case of an underwritten
offering, the Company will use its Best Efforts to obtain all legal opinions,
auditors' consents and comfort letters and experts' cooperation as may be
required, including furnishing to each Selling Holder of such Registrable Shares
a signed counterpart, addressed or confirmed to such Selling Holder, of (a) an
opinion of counsel for the Company and (b) a "cold comfort" letter signed by the
independent public accountants who have certified the Company's financial
statements included in such Registration Statement, covering substantially the
same matters as are customarily covered in opinions of issuer's counsel and in
accountants' letters delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings
of securities.

         4.7. Listing and Transfer Agent. The Company will cause all Registrable
Shares covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which the Class A Common Stock is then
listed. The Company will provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statement not
later than the effective date of such Registration Statement. The Company will
pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligations under
this Section 4.7.

         4.8. General Compliance with Federal Securities Laws; Section 11(a)
Earning Statement. The Company will use its Best Efforts to comply with the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable rules and regulations
of the Commission, and make available to its securities holders, as soon as
reasonably practicable, an earning statement covering the period of at least 12
months after the effective date of such Registration Statement, which earnings
statement shall be in a form complying with and satisfying Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and any applicable regulations thereunder, including the
provisions of Rule 158.

         4.9. Notice of Prospectus Defects. The Company will immediately notify
the Selling Holders of the happening of any event, as a result of which the
prospectus included or to be included in the Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing (provided
that such notice shall not contain any material, non-public information). The
Company will promptly revise such prospectus as may be necessary so that such
prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state such a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing. The Company will promptly deliver copies of such revised prospectus to
the Selling Holders. Following receipt of the revised prospectus, the Selling
Holders will be free to resume making offers of the Registrable Shares. The
Company will

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

extend the period during which the Registration Statement must be kept effective
pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and
including the date of giving such notice to and including the date when the
Selling Holders shall have received copies of the revised prospectus.

         4.10. Company Lock-Up. In the case of an underwritten offering
requested to be effected by the Holders hereunder, the Company will refrain,
without the consent of the managing underwriter, for a period from 15 days

effective date, from directly or indirectly selling, offering to sell, granting
any option for the sale of, or otherwise disposing of any common equity or
securities convertible into common equity other than pursuant to Company
employee equity plans.

         4.11. Delay of Registration and Suspension of Offering. If at any time
(a) after a request to effect a registration pursuant to Section 2 of this
Agreement or (b) after a Registration Statement has become effective, the
Company is engaged in any plan, proposal or agreement with respect to any
financing, acquisition, recapitalization, reorganization or other material
transaction or development the public disclosure of which would be would be
detrimental to the Company, then the Company may direct that such request be
delayed or that use of the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement be
suspended, as applicable, for a period of up to 30 days. The Company will notify
all Holders requesting the registration or all Selling Holders, as the case may
be, of the delay or suspension. In the case of notice suspending an effective
Registration Statement, each Selling Holder will immediately discontinue any
sales of Registrable Shares pursuant to such Registration Statement until such
Selling Holder has received copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus or
until such Selling Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the
then-current prospectus may be used and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in such prospectus. The Company may exercise the rights provided by this Section
4.11 on only one occasion within any 365-day period.

preparation and filing of each Registration Statement, and before filing any

preparation of such Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or
filed with the Commission, each amendment thereof or supplement thereto and any
related underwriting agreement or other document to be filed, and give each of
the aforementioned Persons such access to its books and records and such
opportunities to discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the
independent public accountants who have certified its financial statements as

accountants, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

the Company shall (i) as soon as practicable incorporate in a prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment such information as a Selling Holder
reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale and distribution
of Registrable Shares, including, without limitation, information with respect
to the number of Registrable Shares being offered or sold, the purchase price
being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable
Shares to be sold in such other

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Registration Statement by the Securities Act; (ii) as soon as practicable make
all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus

requested by a Selling Holder of such Registrable Shares.

         4.14. Stop Orders. The Company shall use its Best Efforts to prevent
the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a
Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the
Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or
suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at
the earliest possible moment and to notify each Selling Holder of the issuance
of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

         4.15. Certificates. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with the
Selling Holders and, to the extent applicable, facilitate the timely preparation
and delivery of certificates representing the Registrable Shares to be offered
pursuant to a Registration Statement and enable such certificates to be in such
denominations or amounts, as the case may be, as the Selling Holders may
reasonably request and registered in such names as the Selling Holders may
request.

         4.16. Notice of Effectiveness. Within two business days after a
Registration Statement that includes the Registrable Shares is declared
effective by the Commission, the Company shall deliver, and shall cause legal
counsel for the Company to deliver, to the transfer agent for such Registrable
Shares (with copies to the Selling Holders) written confirmation that such
Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission.

         4.17. Governmental Approvals. The Company shall use its Best Efforts to
cause the Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities
as may be necessary to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Shares.

5. CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS.

         5.1. Additional Procedures. Selling Holders will take all such actions
and execute all such documents and instruments that are reasonably requested by
the Company to effect the sale of their shares in such Public Offering,
including, without limitation, being parties to the underwriting agreement
entered into by the Company and any other Selling Holders in connection
therewith; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of any liability of any
Selling Holder pursuant to such underwriting or other agreement will not exceed
such Selling Holder's net proceeds from such offering. In addition, each Selling
Holder will furnish to the Company such information regarding such Selling
Holder and the distribution proposed by such Selling Holder as the Company may
reasonably request in writing and as will be required in connection with any
registration, qualification or compliance referred to in Section 4.

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

         5.2. Underwriter's Cutback. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the managing underwriter determines that the inclusion of all
shares requested to be registered in an underwritten offering would adversely
affect the offering, the Company may limit the number of Registrable Shares to
be included in the Registration Statement for such offering. If the registration
has been requested by the Holders pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the number of
shares that are entitled to be included in the registration and underwriting
will be reduced in the following manner: (a) first, shares of Company equity
securities, other than Registrable Shares, requested to be included in such
registration by shareholders will be excluded, (b) second, shares of Company
equity securities that the Company desires to include in such registration will
be excluded and (c) third, Registrable Shares requested to be included in such
registration by the Holders will be excluded. If the registration has been
initiated other than pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the number of shares that are
entitled to be included in the Registration Statement for such offering will be
reduced in the following manner: (x) first, shares of Company equity securities,
other than Registrable Shares, requested to be included in such registration by
shareholders will be excluded, (y) second, Registrable Shares requested to be
included in such registration by Holders will be excluded and (z) third, shares
of Company equity securities that the Company desires to include in such
registration will be excluded. To the extent that the underwriters do not deem
it necessary to exclude all of the shares requested to be registered by any
category of shareholders contemplated above, the number of shares that may be
included in the registration will be allocated to the members of such category
requesting registration in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
respective number of shares of Class A Common Stock (assuming conversion of any
convertible securities held by such shareholders) that they held at the time the
Company gives the notice specified in Section 2 or 3.

         5.3. Registration Expenses. The Company hereby agrees to pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with all registrations effected pursuant to
this Agreement. The Company, however, shall not be required to pay for any
expenses of a registration requested pursuant to Sections 2.1 or 2.2 hereof if
the registration request is withdrawn at any time at the request of Holders of a
majority of the Registrable Shares to be included in such registration (in which
case all Holders requesting such withdrawal shall bear such expenses). However,
if the requesting Holders have learned of information (other than information
known to them at the time they made their request) that, in the good faith
judgment of the requesting Holders, is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the business or prospects of the Company, then the Holders
shall not be required to pay any of such expenses in the case of a registration
requested pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2.

         5.4. Termination of Status as Registrable Shares. Registrable Shares
will cease to be Registrable Shares and cease to have the rights accorded to
such shares under this Agreement upon the earliest to occur of the following
events: (x) such shares shall have been sold pursuant to an effective
Registration Statement under the Securities Act or (y) such shares shall have
been sold pursuant to a transaction under Rule 144.

         5.5. Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights. The Company will
not, without the prior written consent of Holders of at least a majority of the
Registrable Shares, enter into any agreements with any holder or prospective
holder of Company securities that grant such holder or prospective holder rights
to include securities of the Company in any Registration Statement, unless such
rights are subordinated to the rights granted to the Holders under this

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Agreement, including, without limitation, by providing that (a) the holders of
such subordinated rights may not request a registration until at least 180 days
after the date on which the Holders can request a registration pursuant to
Section 2.1 and 2.2 and (b) the holders of such subordinated rights shall have
the number of shares of their Company securities requested to be included in a
Registration Statement reduced pursuant to any underwriters' cut-back provision
before the Holders suffer any reduction in the number of Registrable Shares that
they are permitted to include in such registration .

6. INDEMNIFICATION.

         6.1. Company Indemnification. In the event of any registration of any
of the Registrable Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement,
then to the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold
harmless each Selling Holder, its partners, directors and officers and each
other Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each such Person being a "Covered Person")
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
such Covered Person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, state securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
(a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Shares were
registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary or final prospectus
contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement or (b) the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; and the Company will reimburse such Covered Person for
any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable to
any Covered Person in any such case (x) to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
omission made in such Registration Statement or prospectus, or any such
amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished to the Company, in writing, by or on behalf of such Covered Person
specifically for use in the preparation thereof or (y) in the case of a sale
directly by a Selling Holder (including a sale of such Registrable Shares
through any underwriter retained by such Selling Holder engaging in a
distribution solely on behalf of such Selling Holder), such untrue statement or
omission was contained in a preliminary prospectus and corrected in a final or
amended prospectus, and such Selling Holder failed to deliver a copy of the
final or amended prospectus at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the
Registrable Shares to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or
liability in any case in which such delivery is required by the Securities Act.

         6.2. Seller Indemnification. In the event of any registration of any of
the Registrable Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, then
to the extent permitted by law, each Selling Holder will indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers and each Person (other
than such Selling Holder), if any, who controls the Company within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities to which the Company, such directors and officers, or controlling
person may become subject under the Securities Act, Exchange Act, state
securities laws or otherwise,

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Shares
were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary or final prospectus
contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or (b) the omission to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if
the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Selling
Holder, specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such
Registration Statement, prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however,
that the obligations of such Selling Holder hereunder will be limited to an
amount equal to the net proceeds to such Selling Holder (after deducting all
underwriter's discounts and commissions and all other expenses paid by such
Holder in connection with the registration in question) from the disposition of
Registrable Shares pursuant to such registration.

         6.3. Notice of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified
party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a
claim of the type referred to in the foregoing provisions of this Section 6,
such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
any indemnifying party, give written notice to each such indemnifying party of
the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any
indemnified party to give such notice will not relieve such indemnifying party
of its obligations under this Section 6, except to the extent that such
indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure. In case any such
action is brought against an indemnified party, each indemnifying party will be
entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the extent that it may wish,
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and (subject to
the following sentence) after notice from an indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such
indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the
defense thereof. The indemnified party may participate in such defense at such
party's expense; provided, however, that the indemnifying party will pay such
expense if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by
the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
conflict of interests between the indemnified party and any other party
represented by such counsel in such proceeding; provided, further, that in no
event will the indemnifying party be required to pay the expenses of more than
one law firm as counsel for all indemnified parties pursuant to this sentence.
If, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, such indemnifying party has not
elected to assume the defense of the action, such indemnifying party will be
responsible for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense of the action, suit,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding. An indemnifying party may, in the defense
of any such claim or litigation, consent to the entry of a judgment or enter
into a settlement without the consent of the indemnified party only if such
judgment or settlement contains a general release of the indemnified party in
respect of such claims or litigation.

         6.4. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Sections 6.1
or 6.2 hereof is unavailable to a party that would have been an indemnified
party under any such Section in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein,
then each party that would have been an indemnifying party thereunder will, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party on the one hand and
such indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions or proceedings in respect thereof). The relative fault will be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or
such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section 6.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the preceding sentence. The amount paid or payable
by a contributing party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to in this
Section 6.4 will include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

7. MISCELLANEOUS.

         7.1. Reports under the Exchange Act. With a view to making available to
the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the
Commission that may at any time permit such Holder to sell securities of the
Company to the public without registration and with a view to making it possible
for Holders to register the Registrable Shares pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-3, the Company agrees from the date hereof to use its best
efforts to:

                  (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms
         are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

                  (b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports
         and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act
         and the Exchange Act, so long as the Company remains subject to such
         requirements and the filing of such reports and other documents are
         required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144 to apply;

                  (c) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports
         and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act
         and the Exchange Act and take such other actions as will permit Holders
         to use Form S-3 for the resale of their Registrable Shares; and .

                  (d) furnish to any Holder forthwith upon request (i) a written
         statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting
         requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, or
         as to its qualification as a registrant whose securities may be resold
         pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy
         of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such
         other reports and documents so filed by the Company and (iii) such
         other information as may be reasonably requested

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

         in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the Commission that
         permits the selling of any such securities without registration or
         pursuant to such form.

         7.2. Transfer of Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register
Registrable Shares pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 may be assigned by any Holder to
a Permitted Transferee (as defined below), and by such Permitted Transferee to a
subsequent Permitted Transferee, but only if such rights are transferred (a) to
an affiliate or partner of such Holder or Permitted Transferee or a trustee or
an account managed or advised by a manager or adviser of such Holder or
Permitted Transferee or (b) in connection with the sale or other transfer of not
less than an aggregate of 100,000 Registrable Shares or some lesser number, if
such lesser number represents all the Registrable Shares then held by such
Holder. Any transferee to whom rights under this Agreement are transferred will
(x) as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument
by which such transferee agrees to be bound by the obligations imposed upon
Holders under this Agreement to the same extent as if such transferee were a
Holder under this Agreement and (y) be deemed to be a Holder hereunder. Any
Person to whom rights under this Agreement are transferred in accordance with
this Section 7.2 shall be a "Permitted Transferee."

         7.3. Governing Law. This Agreement, the rights of the parties and all
claims, actions, causes of action, suits, litigation, controversies, hearings,
charges, complaints or proceedings arising in whole or in part under or in
connection herewith, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic substantive laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of
the laws of any other jurisdiction.

         7.4. Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement, together
with any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein,
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions,
negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether
written or oral, with respect thereto. Any term of this Agreement may be amended
or terminated and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) with the written consent of the Company and a Majority in
Interest of the Registrable Shares; provided, however, that any such amendment
or waiver treats all holders the same (without regard to any differences in
effect that such amendment or waiver may have on the Holders due to the
differing amounts of Registrable Shares held by such Holders). Any such
amendment, termination or waiver will be binding on all Holders.

         7.5. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims and other
communications required or permitted to be delivered, given or otherwise
provided under this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered, given or
otherwise provided:

                  (a) by hand (in which case, it will be effective upon
         delivery);

                  (b) by facsimile (in which case, it will be effective upon

modified by such court so that it becomes enforceable, and, as modified, will be
enforced as any other provision hereof, all the other provisions hereof
continuing in full force and effect.
