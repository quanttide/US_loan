obligation of the Undersigned enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity.

                  (e) This Guaranty Agreement promotes and furthers the business
and interests of the Undersigned and the creation of the obligations hereunder
will result in direct financial benefit to the Undersigned.

Guaranty Agreement, (b) the existence or incurring from time to time of any
Obligations guaranteed hereunder, (c) the existence of any Event of Default, the

counterclaim whatsoever and any and all other rights, benefits, protections and
other defenses available to the Undersigned now or at any time hereafter.

         (4) The liability of the Undersigned hereunder is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be reduced, impaired or affected in any way by
reason of (a) any failure to obtain, retain or preserve, or the lack of prior
enforcement of, any rights against any person or persons (including Borrower and
the Undersigned) or in any property, (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of
any Obligations or rights in any Collateral, (c) any delay in making demand upon
Borrower or any delay in enforcing, or any failure to enforce, any rights
against Borrower, or in any Collateral even if such rights are thereby lost, (d)

                                       2
<PAGE>

any lien upon, protect, exercise rights against, or realize on, any property of
Borrower, the Undersigned, or any other party securing the Obligations, (e) the
existence or nonexistence of any defenses which may be available to the
Borrower, with respect to the Obligations, or (f) the commencement of any
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or receivership proceeding
or case filed by or against Borrower.

to any obligation hereby guaranteed are recovered from, or repaid by, you in
whole or in part in any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or similar
proceeding instituted by or against Borrower or either of them, this Guaranty
Agreement shall continue to be fully applicable to such obligation to the same
extent as if the recovered or repaid payment(s) had never been originally made
on such obligation.

         (6) All rights and remedies hereunder and under the Loan Agreement, and
related agreements, are cumulative and not alternative. You may proceed in any
order from time to time against Borrower and/or any other obligor of Borrower's
Obligations (other than the Undersigned) and their respective assets. From and
after the Guaranty Payment Date you shall not have any obligation to proceed
against, or exhaust any or all of your rights against Borrower or any other
obligor of Borrower's Obligations and their respective assets, prior to
proceeding against the Undersigned hereunder.

         (7) Any and all rights of any nature of the Undersigned to subrogation,
reimbursement or indemnity and any right of the Undersigned to recourse to any
assets or property of Borrower for any reason are hereby unconditionally waived,
until such time as the Obligations of Borrower to Lender are indefeasibly paid
and satisfied in full.

         (8) Your books and records of any and all of Borrower's Obligations,
absent manifest error, shall be prima facie evidence against the Undersigned of
the indebtedness due you or to become due to you hereunder.

         (9) This Guaranty Agreement shall constitute a continuing guaranty
obligation with respect to all Obligations from time to time incurred or arising
and the liability of the Undersigned under this Guaranty Agreement may not be
revoked or terminated.

         (10) The Undersigned agrees that you shall have a right of setoff
against any and all property of the Undersigned now or at any time in your
possession, including, without limitation, deposit accounts, and the proceeds
thereof, as security for the obligations of the Undersigned hereunder.

         (11) If an Event of Default occurs under the Loan Agreement, then all
of the Undersigned's liabilities of every kind or nature to you hereunder shall,
at your option, become immediately due and payable and you may at any time and
from time to time after the occurrence of the Guaranty Payment Date take any
and/or all actions and enforce all rights and remedies available hereunder or
under applicable law to collect the Undersigned's liabilities hereunder.

         (12) Failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy against the
Undersigned hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver thereof or preclude the
exercise of any other right or remedy hereunder. No waiver of any breach of or
provision of this Guaranty Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or of any other provision. The invalidity or unenforceability
of

                                       3

any provision hereof shall not affect the remaining provisions which shall
remain in full force and effect.

         (13) This Guaranty Agreement shall (a) be legally binding upon the

your prior written consent and (b) benefit any and all of your successors and
assigns. Signature by facsimile shall bind the Undersigned.

         (14) This Guaranty Agreement embodies the whole agreement and
understanding of the parties hereto relative to the subject matter hereof. No
modification or waiver of any provision hereof shall be enforceable unless
approved by you in writing.

         (15) This Guaranty Agreement shall in all respects be interpreted,
construed and governed by the substantive laws of the State of New York. The
Undersigned irrevocably (a) submits to the jurisdiction of the state courts of
the State of New Jersey and the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey for the purposes of any litigation or proceeding hereunder or
concerning the terms hereof and (b) WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING HEREUNDER OR CONCERNING THE TERMS
HEREOF.

         (16) (a) In any action or proceeding brought by you to enforce the
terms hereof, the Undersigned waives personal service of the summons, complaint,
and any motion or other process, and agrees that notice thereof may be served by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested or by nationally
recognized overnight courier at the address of the Undersigned set forth below.
Such service shall be deemed made on the date of delivery at such address.

              (b) Any and all notices which may be given to the Undersigned
by you hereunder shall be sent to the Undersigned at the address of the
Undersigned set forth below and shall be deemed given to and received (on the
