Days notice to Borrowers, Lender may adjust the Advance Rate in order to
reflect, in Lender's reasonable judgment, the experience with Borrowers
(including by way of illustration, to adjust for any known or potential offsets
by Medicare or Medicaid) or the aggregate amount or percentage of the
Collections with respect to the Accounts.

         2.2 Funding Procedures:

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
so long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred

as the "FUNDING DATE".

                  (b) Not later than 11:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) three (3)
Business Days prior to each Designated Funding Date ("DOWNLOAD DATE"), Borrowers
will deliver to Lender the computer file data associated with the Accounts,
which shall include without limitation, the information (including changes in
the Obligor reimbursement rates and changes in federal or state laws or
regulations affecting payment for medical services) required by Lender to enable
Lender to process and value the outstanding Accounts of Borrowers on Lender's
Value Track System(TM), as well as bill and collect such Accounts following an
Event of Default ("ACCOUNTS DETAIL FILE"). Upon completion of the processing of
the data with respect to such Accounts, Lender will prepare and deliver to
Borrowers by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the first Business Day

form of EXHIBIT 2.2(b) (a "BORROWING BASE REPORT").

                  (c) On the Funding Date, Borrowers will sign and return the
Borrowing Base Report to Lender. If Borrowers are requesting that a Loan be made
on such Funding Date, Borrowers shall also deliver to Lender, concurrently with
the Borrowing Base Report, a written request for such Loan substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT 2.2(c) (a "LOAN REQUEST"). The Borrowing Base Report and Loan
Request may be delivered via telecopy and Borrowers acknowledge that Lenders may
rely on Borrowers signatures by facsimile, which shall be legally binding upon
Borrowers.

                  (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if
the Borrowing Base Report (if applicable) and Loan Request are delivered to
Lender before 11:00 A.M. on the Funding Date, Lender will advance on the Funding
Date (or the next Business Day if the Borrowing Base Report and Loan Request are
delivered after 11:00 A.M. (Eastern Time)) to Borrowers a Loan in the amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the Loan requested by Borrowers in the
Loan Request, or (ii) the Borrowing Base Excess as of such date. Any Advances
made by Lender hereunder shall be treated for all purposes as, and shall accrue
interest at the same rate applicable to, Loans.

                  (e) Lender's determination of the Estimated Net Value of the
Eligible Accounts and other amounts to be determined or calculated under this
Agreement shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding and conclusive.

         2.3 Interest and Fees:

                  (a) Each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof from the date made until such Loan is paid in full, at a rate per
annum equal to the lesser of (a) the Highest Lawful Rate or (b) the Prime Rate
plus three percent (3.00%) The interest rate on all amounts outstanding under
the Credit Facility shall be adjusted weekly based on the Prime Rate as of each
Designated Funding Date.

                  (b) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
rate of interest applicable to each Loan then outstanding shall be the Default
Rate. The Default Rate shall apply from the date of the Event of Default until
the date such Event of Default is waived, and interest accruing at the Default
Rate shall be payable upon demand.

                  (c) Should the Credit Facility be terminated for any reason
prior to the last day of the Initial Term, in addition to repayment of all
Obligations then outstanding and termination of Lender's commitment hereunder,
Borrowers shall unconditionally be obligated to pay at the time of such
termination, a fee ("TERMINATION FEE") in an amount equal to the following
percentage of the Revolving Loan Commitment: three percent (3.0%), if such early
termination occurs on or prior to the first anniversary date of this Agreement;
two percent (2.0%) if such early termination occurs after the first anniversary
date of this Agreement but on or before the second anniversary of this
Agreement; and one percent (1.0%) if such early termination occurs after the
second anniversary of the date of this Agreement but prior to the last day of
the Initial Term. Borrowers acknowledge that

                                       13
<PAGE>

the Termination Fee is an estimate of Lender's damages in the event of early
termination and is not a penalty. In the event of termination of the Credit
Facility, all of the Obligations shall be immediately due and payable upon the
termination date stated in any notice of termination. All undertakings,
agreements, covenants, warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in
the Loan Documents shall survive any such termination, and Lender shall retain
its security interests in the Collateral and all of its rights and remedies
under the Loan Documents notwithstanding such termination until Borrowers have
paid the Obligations to Lender, in full, in immediately available funds,
together with the applicable Termination Fee, if any. Notwithstanding the
payment in full of the Obligations, Lender shall not be required to terminate
its security interests in the Collateral unless either (1) the Obligations have
been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement,
or (2) if the Obligations have been satisfied by means other than Lender's
rights under the Guaranty Agreement, with respect to any loss or damage Lender
may incur as a result of dishonored checks or other items of payment received by
Lender from Borrowers or any Obligor and applied to the Obligations, Lender
shall, at its option, (i) have received a written agreement executed by
Borrowers and by any Person whose loans or other advances to Borrowers are used
in whole or in part to satisfy the Obligations, indemnifying Lender from any
such loss or damage; or (ii) have retained such monetary reserves and security
interests on the Collateral for such period of time as Lender, in its reasonable
discretion, may deem necessary to protect Lender from any such loss or damage.

                  (d) Borrowers shall unconditionally pay to Lender a fee
("UNUSED LINE FEE") equal to one half of one percent (0.50%) per annum of the
unused portion of the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility
shall be the difference between the Revolving Loan Commitment and the average
daily outstanding balance of the Loans during each month (or portion thereof),
which fees shall be calculated and payable monthly, in arrears, and shall be due
and payable on the first Designated Funding Date of each calendar month.

         2.4 Additional Interest Provisions:

                  (a) Calculation of Interest: Interest on the Loans shall be
based on a year of three hundred sixty (360) days and charged for the actual
number of days elapsed.

                  (b) Continuation of Interest Charges: All contractual rates of
interest chargeable on outstanding Loans shall continue to accrue and be paid
even after default, maturity, acceleration, termination of the Credit Facility,
judgment, bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings of any kind or the happening of any
event or occurrence similar or dissimilar.

                  (c) Applicable Interest Limitations: Borrowers and Lender
intend to conform strictly to the usury laws in force that apply to the
transactions evidenced or contemplated hereby. Accordingly, all agreements among
Borrowers and Lender, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether
written or oral, are hereby limited so that in no contingency, whether by reason
of acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Credit Note, or otherwise,
shall the interest (and all other sums that are deemed to be interest)
contracted for, charged, received, paid or agreed to be paid exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate (as defined below). Borrowers and Lender stipulate and agree that
the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement and the Loan Documents are
not intended to and shall never be construed to create a contract to pay for the
use, forbearance or

                                       14
<PAGE>

detention of money in an amount in excess of the maximum amount permitted to be
charged by applicable law, if any.

                  Anything in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the
contrary notwithstanding, neither Borrowers nor any other party now or hereafter
becoming liable for payment of the Revolving Credit Note shall ever be required
to pay interest on or with respect to the Revolving Credit Note or any other
obligation hereunder at a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and if the
effective rate of interest that would otherwise be payable under this Agreement
or on or with respect to the Revolving Credit Note would exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate, or if Lender shall receive anything of value that is deemed or
determined to constitute interest that would increase the effective rate of
interest payable under this Agreement or on or with respect to the Revolving
Credit Note or the Loan Documents to a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful
Rate, then (a) the amount of interest that would otherwise be payable under this
Agreement, the Revolving Credit Note or the Loan Documents shall be reduced to
the amount allowed at the Highest Lawful Rate under applicable law, and (b) any
unearned interest paid by the Borrowers or any interest paid by Borrowers in
excess of the Highest Lawful Rate shall, at the option of the Lender, be either
refunded to Borrowers or credited on the principal of such Revolving Credit
Note. It is further agreed that, without limitation of the foregoing, all
calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged or received by
Lender, or under this Agreement, that are made for the purpose of determining
whether such rate exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, shall be made, to the extent
permitted by applicable law (now or, to the extent permitted by law, hereafter
enacted) governing the Highest Lawful Rate, by (i) characterizing any
nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, and
(ii) amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading in equal parts during the
period of the full term of the Revolving Credit Note (including the period of
any renewal or extension thereof), all interest at any time contracted for,
charged or received by such registered holder in connection therewith. As used
herein, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum nonusurious rate of
interest permitted from time to time to be contracted for, taken, charged or
received with respect to the Revolving Credit Note by Lender, under applicable
law as in effect with respect to this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Note.

         2.5 Payments:

                  (a) All accrued interest on the Loans shall be due and payable
weekly on the Designated Funding Date. Any Unused Line Fees shall be due and
payable monthly on the first Designated Funding Date of each month with respect
to Unused Line Fees which accrued during the prior month.

                  (b) If at any time the aggregate principal amount of all
Advances outstanding exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect, Borrowers shall
immediately make such principal prepayments of the Loans (subject to the terms
of Sections 2.3(c) and 2.3(d)), as is necessary to eliminate such excess.

                  (c) The entire principal balance of all of the Advances,
together with all unpaid accrued interest thereon and the Termination Fee, if
any, and any unpaid Unused Line Fees, shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date.

                                       15
<PAGE>

                  (d) Subject to the terms of Sections 2.3(c) and 2.3(d) above,
Borrowers may prepay the principal of the Loans on any Designated Funding Date
by giving Lender written notice of the proposed prepayment two Business Days'
prior to such Designated Funding Date.

                  (e) All payments and prepayments shall be applied first to any
unpaid interest and fees and thereafter to the principal of the Loans and to
other amounts due Lender, in the order provided in Section 2.7(f) hereof. Except
as otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest, fees, or
other amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall be remitted to Lender in
immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the day
due. Whenever any payment is stated as due on a day which is not a Business Day,
the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day and interest shall continue to accrue during such extension.

         2.6 Use of Proceeds: The extensions of credit under and proceeds of the
Credit Facility shall be used to repay existing Indebtedness of Borrowers and
for working capital and general business purposes.

         2.7 Lockboxes and Collections:

                  (a) Borrowers (other than DCPS, MBS and IntegriMED) will enter
into lockbox agreements in respect of the Government Lockbox and Commercial
Lockbox in such form and with the Lockbox Bank or such other bank as is
acceptable to Lender. Borrowers shall instruct the Lockbox Bank maintaining the
Government Lockbox that all collections sent to the Government Lockbox shall be
deposited into a bank account at the Lockbox Bank in which Lender has a first
priority perfected security interest and all Collections sent to the Commercial
Lockbox shall be deposited into a bank account at the Lockbox Bank in the name
of Lender. Borrower shall also instruct the Lockbox Bank to initiate, or accept
an initiation from Lender which effectuates, a daily transfer of all available
funds to an account of Lender to be designated by Lender ("COLLECTION ACCOUNT").

                  (b) Borrowers (other than DCPS, MBS and IntegriMED) will cause
all Collections with respect to all of the Accounts, other than Government
Accounts, to be sent directly to the Commercial Lockbox, and will cause all
Collections with respect to all of the Government Accounts to be sent directly
to the Government Lockbox (which may be effectuated by electronic transfer
directly to the Government Lockbox). In the event that a Borrower receives any
Collections that should have been sent to the Commercial Lockbox or the
Government Lockbox, such Borrower will, promptly upon receipt and in any event
within one Business Day of receipt, forward such Collections directly to the
Commercial Lockbox or Government Lockbox, as applicable, in the form received,
and if requested by Lender, promptly notify Lender of such event. Until so
forwarded, such Collections not generated from Government Accounts shall be held
in trust for the benefit of Lender.

                  (c) No Borrower shall withdraw any amounts from the accounts
into which the Collections remitted to the Commercial Lockbox are deposited nor
shall any Borrower change the procedures under the agreements governing the
Commercial Lockbox and related accounts.

                                       16
<PAGE>

                  (d) Borrowers will cooperate with Lender in the identification
and reconciliation on a daily basis of all amounts received in the Commercial
Lockbox and the Government Lockbox. If more than five percent (5%) of the
Collections since the most recent Funding Date is not identified or reconciled
to the satisfaction of Lender within ten (10) Business Days of receipt, Lender
shall not be obligated to make further Loans until such amount is identified or
is reconciled to the reasonable satisfaction of Lender, as the case may be. In
addition, if any such amount cannot be identified or reconciled to the
reasonable satisfaction of Lender, Lender may utilize its own staff or, if it
deems necessary, engage an outside auditor, in either case at Borrowers' expense
(which in the case of Lender's own staff shall be in accordance with Lender's
then prevailing customary charges (plus expenses), to make such examination and
report as may be necessary to identify and reconcile such amount.

                  (e) No Borrower will send to or deposit in the Commercial
Lockbox or the Government Lockbox any funds other than payments made with
respect to Accounts.

                  (f) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, on each
Designated Funding Date, Lender shall cause all Collections deposited and/or
transferred to the Collection Account since the last Designated Funding Date to
be disbursed in the following order of priority:

                           (i) to Lender, any costs and Expenses of Lender
required to be paid or reimbursed by Borrowers under this Agreement or under any
of the other Loan Documents;

                           (ii) to Lender, an amount equal to the unpaid accrued
interest on the aggregate outstanding Advances as of such Designated Funding
Date;

                           (iii) to Lender, an amount equal to any unpaid
accrued Unused Line Fees which are then due and payable as of such Designated
Funding Date;

                           (iv) to Lender, the amount of any Borrowing Base
Deficiency, if any;

                           (v) to Lender, to the aggregate outstanding amount of
the Loans and any and all other fees due and payable hereunder in such order as
Lender may determine in its discretion; and

                           (vi) subject to Sections 2.3(c) and (d), to Lender,
the amount of any prepayment of principal of which Borrowers have given notice
to Lender in accordance with Section 2.5(d) hereof.

         In addition, promptly upon request of Borrowers, so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred, Lender shall disburse to Borrowers the amount, if
any, by which the collected balance in the Collection Account exceeds the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances and all interest and
other amounts that will be payable on the next Designated Funding Date.
Following the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may apply all
Collections to Borrowers' Obligations in such order as Lender may in its sole
discretion determine.

negotiation of the Credit Facility and contained in any financial statements or
documents relating to any Borrower contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein

Borrower shall have, prior to the related Funding Date, certified in an

terminated:

         6.1 Payment of Taxes and Claims: Each Borrower shall pay, before they
become delinquent, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
imposed upon it or upon such Borrower's Property, except for those being
contested in good faith with due diligence by appropriate proceedings and for
which appropriate reserves have been maintained under GAAP.

         6.2 Maintenance of Insurance, Financial Records and Existence:

which all losses thereunder shall be paid to Lender as Lender's interests may

Lender and shall insure Lender notwithstanding the act or neglect of the
insured. At or prior to Closing, Borrowers shall furnish Lender with insurance
certificates certified as true and correct and being in full force and effect as

In the event Borrowers fail to procure or cause to be procured any such
insurance or to timely pay or cause to be paid the premium(s) on any such
insurance, after five (5) days notice to the Borrowers unless Lender, in its
reasonable judgment, determines that immediate action is necessary to preserve
or protect its rights hereunder or in the Collateral, Lender may do so for
Borrowers, but Borrowers shall continue to be liable for the same. Borrowers
further covenant that all insurance premiums owing under its current casualty
policy have been paid. Borrowers also agree to notify Lender, promptly, upon
Borrowers' receipt of a notice of termination, cancellation or non-renewal from
its insurance company of any such policy. Each Borrower hereby appoints Lender

insurance.

                  (b) Public Liability and Business Interruption Insurance -
Borrowers shall maintain, and shall deliver to Lender upon Lender's request
evidence of public liability and business interruption insurance in such amounts
as is customary for companies in the same or similar businesses located in the

granted by this Agreement and other Loan Documents which would not have been
available to an individual Borrower acting alone. Each Borrower has determined
that it is in its best interest to procure the Credit Facility which each
Borrower may utilize directly and which receive the credit support of the other
Borrowers as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) Lender has advised Borrowers that it is unwilling to enter
into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and make available the Credit
Facility extended hereby to any Borrower unless each Borrower agrees, among
other things, to be jointly and severally liable for the due and proper payment
of the Obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement and other Loan
Documents. Each Borrower has determined that it is in its best interest and in
pursuit of its purposes that it so induce Lender to extend credit pursuant to
this Agreement and the other documents executed in connection herewith (i)
because of the desirability to each Borrower of the Credit Facility, the
interest rates and the modes of borrowing available hereunder, (ii) because each
Borrower may engage in transactions jointly with other Borrowers and (iii)
because each Borrower may require, from time to time, access to funds under this
Agreement for the purposes herein set forth.

                  (c) Each Borrower has determined that it has and, after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, the inter-Borrower arrangement set
forth in this Section 10.1) will have, assets having a fair saleable value in
excess of the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing
debts as they fall due for payment and that the sum of its debts is not and will
not then be greater than all of its Property at a fair valuation, that such
Borrower has, and will have, access to adequate capital for the conduct of its
business and the ability to pay its debts from time to time incurred in

                                       48

connection therewith as such debts mature and that the value of the benefits to
be derived by such Borrower from the access to funds under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the inter-Borrower arrangement set forth in this
Section 10.1) is reasonably equivalent to the obligations undertaken pursuant
hereto.

                  (d) Orion (on behalf of each Borrower) shall maintain records
specifying (a) all Obligations incurred by each Borrower, (b) the date of such
incurrence, (c) the date and amount of any payments made in respect of such
Obligations and (d) all inter-Borrower obligations pursuant to this Section 10.
Orion shall make copies of such records available to Lender, upon request.

         10.2 Maximum Amount Of Joint and Several Liability: To the extent that
applicable law otherwise would render the full amount of the joint and several
obligations of any Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents invalid
or unenforceable, such Borrower's obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents shall be limited to the maximum amount which does not result in such
invalidity or unenforceability, provided, however, that each Borrower's
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be presumptively
valid and enforceable to their fullest extent in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof, as if this Section 10.2 were not a part of this Agreement.

         10.3 Authorization of Orion by Borrowers:

                  (a) Each of Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorizes Orion to
give notices, make requests, make payments, receive payments and notices, give
receipts and execute agreements, make agreements or take any other action
whatever on behalf of such Borrower under and with respect to any Loan Document
and each Borrower shall be bound thereby. This authorization is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable, and Lender may rely on any notice, request,
information supplied by Orion every document executed by Orion every agreement
made by Orion or other action taken by Orion in respect of Borrowers or any
thereof as if the same were supplied, made or taken by any or all Borrowers.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the failure of one or more
Borrowers to join in the execution of any writing in connection herewith shall
not, unless the context clearly requires, relieve any such Borrower from
obligations in respect of such writing.

                  (b) Borrowers acknowledge that the credit provided hereunder
is on terms more favorable than any Borrower acting alone would receive and that
each Borrower benefits directly and indirectly from all Advances hereunder. Each
of Borrowers, shall be jointly and severally liable for all Obligations,
regardless of, inter alia, which Borrower requested (or received the proceeds
of) a particular Advance.
