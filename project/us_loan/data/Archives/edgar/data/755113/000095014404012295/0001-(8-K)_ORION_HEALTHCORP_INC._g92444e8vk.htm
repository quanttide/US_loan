<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;15, 2004, Orion HealthCorp, Inc. (formerly SurgiCare,
Inc., &#147;SurgiCare&#148;) (&#147;Orion&#148; or the
&#147;Company&#148;) consummated its previously-disclosed restructuring transactions (the &#147;Closing&#148;), which
included issuances of new equity securities for cash and contribution of outstanding debt, the
acquisition of three new businesses and the restructuring of its debt facilities. The Company also
completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split, created three new classes of common stock and changed
its name. SurgiCare common stock has been converted to Orion Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The Company
also created Class&nbsp;B and Class&nbsp;C Common Stock, which was issued in connection with the equity
investments and acquisitions. SurgiCare shareholders of record will be notified regarding
exchanging their SurgiCare stock certificates for those of Orion. These transactions, as well as
other related matters, were previously described in SurgiCare&#146;s proxy statement dated September&nbsp;10,
2004 (the &#147;Proxy Statement&#148;), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. References to the
Proxy Statement contained in this current report are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the full text of the Proxy Statement (see Exhibit 20.1 to this
current report).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>The Acquisitions</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Acquisition of Integrated Physician Solutions, Inc.</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the acquisition by Orion of Integrated Physician Solutions, Inc. (&#147;IPS&#148;) by
merging a newly-formed SurgiCare subsidiary with and into IPS, IPS equityholders and certain IPS
debtholders received an aggregate of 4,470,654 shares of Orion Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. This number
approximately equals the total number of shares of Orion Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis prior to closing the IPS acquisition and the other transactions consummated at
the Closing. This acquisition was consummated on substantially the same terms described in the
Proxy Statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Acquisition of Dennis Cain Physician Solutions, Ltd. and Medical Billing Services,
Inc.</U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion also acquired Dennis Cain Physician Solutions, Ltd. (&#147;DCPS&#148;), and Medical Billing
Services, Inc. (&#147;MBS&#148;). The Company acquired MBS by merging a newly-formed SurgiCare subsidiary
with and into MBS, with MBS as the surviving corporation. As a consequence of the merger, MBS
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orion. DCPS was acquired by the contribution of the units of
limited partnership interest in DCPS to Orion, and the limited liability company interests of the
limited liability company that is the general partner of DCPS were also contributed to Orion.
Immediately following the Closing, the interests in DCPS and its general partner were transferred
to MBS. These acquisitions occurred on substantially the same terms described in the Proxy
Statement, except that pursuant to the terms of the Second Amendment to Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, among SurgiCare, DCPS/MBS Acquisition, Inc., Dennis Cain
Physician Solutions, Ltd., Medical Billing Services, Inc., and the sellers party thereto (the
&#147;<U>Second Amendment to DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement</U>&#148;) the MBS sellers took $500,000 in
promissory notes in lieu of the same amount of cash which was otherwise payable at the Closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders
of MBS common stock and DCPS limited partnership interests received an aggregate of $3,000,000
in cash, promissory notes of Orion in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 and 1,575,760
shares of Class&nbsp;C Common Stock. The purchase price is subject to retroactive increase (including
issuance of up to 450,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock) or decrease based on the financial
results of the newly-formed company and its predecessors in 2004 and 2005. The terms of such
increase or decrease were modified by the Second Amendment to
DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement. Such modifications included changing (a) the
EBITDA target for the retroactive increase or decrease from
$1.6&nbsp;million for each of the fiscal years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and December&nbsp;31, 2005 to an aggregate of
$2&nbsp;million for both fiscal years, (b)&nbsp;the payment date
for all retroactive increases and decreases until after final
determination of the EBITDA for the fiscal year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, and (c)&nbsp;the payments to or from the MBS
sellers in the event of a retroactive increase, or decrease,
respectively, to reflect the change in form of the initial
consideration paid to the MBS Sellers. In
addition, 75,758 shares of SurgiCare&#146;s Class&nbsp;A

the sellers of the DCPS and MBS
equity, and the MBS and DCPS equityholders may receive other payments as described in the Proxy
Statement. Such 75,758 shares are included as outstanding for purposes of reporting ownership
percentages herein. As previously disclosed in the Proxy Statement, the shares of Class&nbsp;C Common
Stock are convertible into shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The description of the terms of the
Second Amendment to DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement contained in the foregoing is a summary and does not
purport to be complete. Such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Second Amendment to DCPS/MBS Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.1.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>The Equity Financing &#150; Issuance of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock Convertible Into Class&nbsp;A Common Stock</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion issued 11,482,261
shares of its Class&nbsp;B Common Stock to various investors for
$13,200,000 in cash plus cash in the amount of $128,350, which amount equaled the accrued but
unpaid interest immediately prior to the Closing owed to a subsidiary of Brantley Partners IV, L.P.
(&#147;Brantley IV&#148;) by SurgiCare and IPS on amounts advanced prior to October&nbsp;24, 2003 (the &#147;Base
Bridge Interest Amount&#148;). The $13,328,350 of cash proceeds represented an increase of
approximately $3,200,000 over the aggregate sale price previously
disclosed in the Proxy Statement
for the same number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, and therefore represented additional cash
proceeds to the Company. At the Closing, Orion used $5,908,761 to pay
off the debt owed to the subsidiary of Brantley IV.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement described in the Proxy Statement, Brantley IV or its
assignees agreed to subscribe for and purchase from SurgiCare the 11,482,261 shares in
consideration for $10,000,000 plus the Base Bridge Interest Amount. In connection with
consummation of the transactions, Brantley IV entered into a Supplemental Stock Subscription
Agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, by and among SurgiCare, Brantley IV and each of the
investors listed on Schedule&nbsp;I thereto, who are affiliates of Brantley IV (the &#147;Supplemental Stock
Subscription Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which such investors acquired $1,000,000 worth of the Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock which Brantley IV had agreed to purchase pursuant to the Stock Subscription Agreement
and Brantley IV agreed to assign its right to acquire such shares. Accordingly, Brantley IV&#146;s
potential ownership was decreased by the number of shares valued at $1,000,000, after taking into
account the additional investment pursuant to the Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock
Subscription Agreement described below, or 861,491 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, which initially
represented, on an as-converted basis, 3.31% of Orion&#146;s outstanding equity after the Closing. The
description of the terms of the Supplemental Stock Subscription Agreement contained in the
foregoing is a summary and does not purport to be complete. Such description is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the Supplemental Stock Subscription Agreement, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Brantley IV entered
into a Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock Subscription
Agreement (the &#147;Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock Subscription Agreement&#148;), dated as of
December&nbsp;15, 2004, by and among SurgiCare, Brantley IV and each of the investors listed on Schedule
I thereto (the &#147;Additional
Investors&#148;), which include Brantley Capital Corporation (&#147;Brantley Capital&#148;), pursuant to which such investors purchased a portion of the shares of the Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock for which Brantley IV had subscribed in consideration for an aggregate investment of
$3,200,000, which was in addition to the Brantley IV purchase price of $10&nbsp;million plus the Base
Bridge Interest Amount. The 2,756,774 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock issued to the Additional
Investors was deducted from the total number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock which were to be
issued to Brantley IV under the Stock Subscription Agreement. Each investor received its pro rata
portion of the total number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. Accordingly, the investment by the
Additional Investors did not change the total number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock issued
pursuant to the Stock Subscription Agreement. However, the investment by the Additional Investors
did increase the total purchase price, and the purchase price per share, for the shares of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock issued under the Stock Subscription Agreement. The increase in purchase price will
result in an increase in the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. The description of the terms of the Second Amendment and
Supplement to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Stock Subscription Agreement contained in the foregoing is a summary and does not purport to
be complete. Such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock Subscription Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit&nbsp;10.2.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares received by Brantley IV and its co-investors constitute approximately 61.21% of
Orion&#146;s outstanding equity after the Closing on an as-converted
basis. As previously disclosed in
the Proxy Statement, Brantley IV also received the option to purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock for cash in an amount up to an aggregate of $3,000,000 after the Closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>New Line of Credit</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion also entered into a new secured two-year revolving credit facility pursuant to the Loan
and Security Agreement (the &#147;Loan and Security Agreement&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, by and
among Orion, certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries, and Healthcare Business Credit Corporation
(&#147;HBCC&#148;). Under this facility, up to $4,000,000 of loans may be made available to Orion, subject
to a borrowing base. Orion borrowed $1,600,000 under this facility concurrently with the Closing.
The interest rate under this facility is the prime rate plus 3%. Upon
an event of default, HBCC can accelerate the loans or call the
Guarantees described below. In connection with entering into this new facility, Orion also restructured its previously-existing
debt facilities. Orion restructured such debt facilities on
substantially the same terms described in the Proxy Statement, which
resulted in a decrease in aggregate debt owed to DVI Business Credit
Corp. and DVI Financial Services, Inc. from approximately

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">with the exception of 4,000

SurgiCare.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrence L. Bauer, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of IPS, will continue to
run the IPS business of Orion following the Closing. He has entered into an employment agreement
with Orion and has become the Chief Executive Officer of Orion, reporting to its board of

As of immediately prior to the Closing, he owned 200,000 shares

approximately 0.05% of Orion&#146;s outstanding equity after the Closing on an as-converted basis.
Simultaneously with the execution of the new employment agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Bauer terminated his

the authority to appoint a member to any advisory board established by the Orion board of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion has entered into agreements to employ Messrs.&nbsp;LeBlanc, Bauer, Murdock, Cain and Smith in
the capacities described above. The initial term of each employment agreement is five years. The
employment agreements provide that Orion may pay bonuses to the executives upon the attainment of
objectives determined by the board of directors. By entering into these employment agreements, the
executives agree not to disclose confidential information or engage in an activity that interferes
with Orion until the second anniversary of (i)&nbsp;the end of the executive&#146;s employment agreement or
(ii)&nbsp;termination of the executive&#146;s employment (&#147;Non-Competition Period&#148;). If an executive&#146;s
employment is terminated without cause, the agreements provide for continuation of the executive&#146;s
base salary until the expiration of the Non-Competition Period and a minimum bonus of 50% of the
average of the bonus payments made to the executive in the two years immediately preceding the
termination. All options would also vest at that time. Orion&#146;s base annual salary commitments
under the employment agreements are as follows: $240,000 to each of Keith G. LeBlanc and Terrence
L. Bauer; and $175,000 to each of Stephen H. Murdock, Dennis Cain and Tom M. Smith. The

their resignation effective as of the Closing, made an investment in the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock as
Additional Investors and are party to the Second Amendment and Supplement to Stock Subscription
Agreement. Dr.&nbsp;Penso received 86,149 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock in consideration for his
investment of $100,000, and a limited liability company controlled by Dr.&nbsp;Mineo and his wife

Brantley Partners, a private equity firm with offices in Ohio and California. Since the firm&#146;s
inception in 1987, it has been a lead investor in over 40 privately held companies in a variety of
manufacturing, technology and service industries throughout the United States. Brantley Partners
and its affiliates have approximately $300&nbsp;million of committed capital under management.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brantley Capital and Brantley III each held debt of IPS and are party to the Debt Exchange
Agreement. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreement, Brantley Capital and Brantley III received
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock with a fair market value (based on the daily average of the high and low price
per share of SurgiCare common stock over the five trading days immediately prior to the Closing)
equal to the amount owing to it under its loan to IPS in exchange for contribution of such debt to
Orion. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreement, Brantley Capital also received Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock with a fair market value (based on the daily average of the high and low price per share of
SurgiCare common stock over the five trading days immediately prior to the Closing) equal to the
amount of certain accrued dividends owed to it by IPS in exchange for the contribution of such
indebtedness, provided that the amount of shares received in respect of such dividends was subject
to reduction to the extent necessary to achieve the guaranteed allocation of shares of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock to the holders of IPS common stock and Series&nbsp;B Convertible preferred stock pursuant
to the IPS Merger Agreement. The aggregate amount of debt exchanged by the parties to the Debt
Exchange Agreement was $4,375,229, which included accrued interest as of the Closing, and $593,100
of debt in respect of accrued dividends.

Capital and Brantley III previously owned an aggregate of 1,653,000 shares of the
Series&nbsp;A-2 convertible preferred stock of IPS with a liquidation preference of approximately
$6,705,037, and received 2,312,081 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock pursuant to the IPS Merger
Agreement. Such shares were intended to approximate the value of such liquidation preference, but
were subject to reduction to the extent necessary to achieve the guaranteed allocation to holders
of certain classes of IPS common stock discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brantley IV and its co-investors also received the right to register Registrable Shares (as

among Orion and the investors set forth on Schedule&nbsp;I thereto (the &#147;Registration Rights
Agreement&#148;). &#147;Registrable Shares&#148; means the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock currently issued, or issued in
the future, to Brantley IV and its permitted transferees (including shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
into which shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock or other securities of Orion are convertible) other than

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Brantley IV and its co-investors and/or their
permitted transferees, holding at least 50&nbsp;percent of the Registrable Shares have the right to
request that Orion effect the registration on Form S-1 of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock having an
anticipated net aggregate offering price of at least $5,000,000. Orion is not required to effect
any such registration within six months after the effective date of any such registration
statement. Additionally, at any time Orion is eligible to file a registration statement on Form
S-3, Brantley IV, and/or its permitted transferees, may request that Orion effect the registration
on Form S-3 of Registrable Shares having an anticipated net aggregate offering price of at least
$500,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time Orion otherwise proposes to register any of its equity securities under the
Securities Act, Brantley IV and its co-investors and/or their permitted transferees may request the
registration of Registrable Shares. However, Orion is not obligated to effect any registration of
shares incidental to the registration of Orion Securities in connection with a Form S-8 or a Form

Common Stock issuable upon conversion of its shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. Initially, this will
be approximately 16,033,984 shares but, assuming everything else remains the same, the number of
shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock as to which Brantley IV and its co-investors have registration
rights will continually increase, since the conversion factor for the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock is
designed to yield additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or portions thereof, necessary to
approximate the unpaid portion of the return of the original purchase price for the Class&nbsp;B Common
Stock, including the additional investment by the Additional Investors, less the Base Bridge
Interest Amount, plus an amount equal to nine percent (9%) per annum on the amount of the original
purchase price from time to time outstanding less the Base Bridge Interest Amount, without
compounding, from the date the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock was first issued to the date of conversion.
Brantley IV and its co-investors and their permitted transferees will also have registration rights
for any additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (including Class&nbsp;A Common Stock into which other
securities of Orion are convertible) issued to them. The third-party beneficiaries will have
registration rights for one year with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately 6,122,172
shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. If the registration rights are exercised and the underlying shares

International Corporate Holdings, Ltd. v. SurgiCare, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York. Subsequently, SurgiCare filed suit against A.I. International
Corporate Holdings, Ltd. and First National Bank, S.A.L. of Lebanon in the 215<SUP>th</SUP>
Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The New York case involved allegations that
SurgiCare defaulted on its loan agreement. The plaintiffs in the New York case sued SurgiCare for
$834,252 representing the loan amount and interest, plus $219,000, representing damages for
&#147;No-filing Charges&#148; and &#147;Non-Effective Charges&#148; under the contract. SurgiCare&#146;s lawsuit in Texas
asserted that the loan agreement was usurious. The parties reached an agreement to settle this
matter which will close upon the full and complete execution of the Stipulation of Settlement by
all parties and after the consummation of the transactions described in the Proxy Statement.
Pursuant to this settlement, SurgiCare paid the plaintiffs $220,000 in cash at the Closing and
issued 210,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock.
