                            ARTICLE 1 - STOCKHOLDERS

         1.1 Place of Meetings. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
such place, within or without the State of Delaware, or, if so determined by the
Board of Directors in its sole discretion, at no place (but rather by means of
remote communication), as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors or the President or, if not so designated, at the principal executive
office of the corporation.

         1.2 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election
of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting shall be held at such date and time as shall be fixed
by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. If no annual
meeting is held in accordance with the foregoing provisions, a special meeting
may be held in lieu of the annual meeting, and any action taken at that special
meeting shall have the same effect as if it had been taken at the annual
meeting, and in such case all references in these By-Laws to the annual meeting
of stockholders shall be deemed to refer to such special meeting.

         1.3 Special Meeting. Special meetings of stockholders may be called at
any time by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer
(or, if there is no Chief Executive Officer, the President) or by vote of a
majority of the Board of Directors. Any business transacted at any special
meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or
purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

         1.4 Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, written
notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be
given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of
the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notices of
all meetings shall state the place, if any, the date, the means of remote
communications, if any by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such meeting, and the hour of the meeting. The
notice of a special meeting shall state, in addition, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be
given either personally or by mail, electronic mail, telecopy, telegram or other
electronic or wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent
charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that
stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation. Notice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail
or at the time of transmission when sent by electronic mail, telecopy, telegram
or other electronic or wireless means. An affidavit of the mailing or other
means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the
secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving
the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice or
report.

         1.5 Voting List. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for a period of
at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, for any purpose germane to the
meeting on either a reasonably accessible electronic network (for which such
information required to access the electronic

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

network shall be provided with the notice of the meeting) or, during ordinary
business hours, at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held. If
the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept
at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time of the meeting, and
may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access
such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

         1.6 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares of the
capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at
the meeting, present in person, by means of remote communication, if authorized,
or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business.

         1.7 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to any
other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held
under these By-Laws by the stockholders present or represented at the meeting
and entitled to vote, although less than a quorum, or, if no stockholder is
present, by any officer entitled to preside at or to act as secretary of such
meeting. It shall not be necessary to notify any stockholder of any adjournment
of less than thirty (30) days if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken, unless after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the
adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting.

         1.8 Voting. Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of
capital stock entitled to vote and held of record by such stockholder, unless
otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. Each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person or by
electronic means, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion.

         Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the
shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or,
except when the matter is the election of directors, may vote them against the
proposal; but if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the
stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the
stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder
is entitled to vote.

         1.9 Proxy Representation. Every stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a stockholder
is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting
to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent
without a meeting. The delivery of a proxy on behalf of a stockholder consistent
with telephonic or electronically transmitted instructions obtained pursuant to
procedures of the corporation reasonably designed to verify that such
instructions have been authorized by such stockholder shall constitute execution
and delivery of the proxy by or on behalf of the stockholder. No proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless such proxy provides
for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may
be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled
is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.
The authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to specified action,
provided, however, that if a proxy limits its authorization to a meeting or
meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy
shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall not
be valid after the final adjournment thereof. A proxy purporting to be
authorized by or on behalf of a stockholder, if accepted by the corporation in
its discretion, shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its
exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.

         1.10 Action at Meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a
plurality of the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect the
candidate to such office and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any
question other than an election to an office shall decide the question, except
when a larger vote is required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, by
the By-Laws or by the rules or regulations of the NASD, Nasdaq or any stock
exchange applicable to the corporation. No ballot shall be required for any
election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting
and entitled to vote in the election.

         1.11 Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are nominated in
accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as
directors. The nomination for election to the Board of Directors of the
corporation at a meeting of stockholders may be made only (a) pursuant to the
notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction
of the Board of Directors, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors
or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record of
the corporation at the time the notice provided for below in this Section 1.11
is delivered to the Secretary who is entitled to vote in the election of
directors at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth
in this Section 1.11. Such nominations, other than those made by or on behalf of
the Board of Directors, shall be made by timely notice in writing delivered or
mailed to the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.12. Such
notice shall set forth (a) as to each proposed nominee (i) the name, age,
business address and, if known, residence address of each such nominee, (ii) the
principal occupation or employment of each such nominee, (iii) the number of
shares of stock of the corporation which are beneficially owned by each such
nominee, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person
or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder,
and (iv) any other information concerning the nominee that must be disclosed as
to nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), including such
person's written consent to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if
elected; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice, the information
required to be provided pursuant to Section 1.12. The corporation may require
any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be
required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed
nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.

         The chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with the provisions

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

of this Section 1.11, and if he or she should so determine, the chair shall so
declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a
nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 1.11. Nothing in this Section 1.11 shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.

         1.12 Notice of Business at Annual Meetings. At an annual meeting of the
stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly
brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting,
business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, (c) otherwise properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder who was a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the
stockholder's notice provided for below in this Section 1.12 is delivered to the
Secretary who is entitled to vote and who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 1.12. For business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, if such business relates to the election of
directors of the corporation, the procedures in Section 1.11 must be complied
with. If such business relates to any other matter, the stockholder must have
given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a
stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed by first class United States
mail, postage prepaid, and received by the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not less than ninety (90) calendar days nor more than
one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if
the annual meeting is not held within thirty (30) days before or after such
anniversary date, then for the notice by the stockholder to be timely it must be
so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
date on which the notice of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was
made, whichever occurs first. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of
the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of
the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (d) any
material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything
in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual
meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.12
and except that any stockholder proposal which complies with Rule 14a-8 of the
proxy rules, or any successor provision, promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is to be included in the corporation's
proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders shall be deemed to comply
with the requirements of this Section 1.12.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

         The chair of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.12, and if he or she should
so determine, the chair shall so declare to the meeting and any such business
not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present business,
such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 1.12. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.

         1.13 Action without Meeting. Stockholders may not take any action by
written consent in lieu of a meeting.

         1.14 Conduct of Meeting. The Chairman of the Board or, in his or her
absence, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief Executive Officer or
the President, in the order named, shall call meetings of the stockholders to
order and act as chair of such meeting; provided, however, that, in the absence
of the Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors may appoint any stockholder
to act as chair of any meeting. The Secretary of the corporation or, in his or
her absence, any Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of
the stockholders; provided, however, that in the absence of the Secretary at any
meeting of the stockholders, the person acting as chair at any meeting may
appoint any person to act as secretary of such meeting.

         The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to make
such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it
shall deem appropriate. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of
Directors, if any, the person presiding over the meeting shall have the right
and authority to convene and adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of the
person presiding over the meeting, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for
the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing
an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on
participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and
their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the
person presiding over the meeting shall permit, restrictions on entry to the
meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the
time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the
opening and closing of the polls for balloting and matters which are to be voted
on by ballot. The person presiding over the meeting, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter
or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if the person
presiding over the meeting should so determine and declare, any such matter or
business shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
rules of parliamentary procedure.

                             ARTICLE 2 - DIRECTORS

         2.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of the corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, who may exercise
all of the powers of the corporation except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. In the event of a vacancy in the
Board of Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by
law, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is
filled.

         2.2 Number; Election and Qualification. The number of directors which
shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be determined by resolution
of the Board of Directors, but in no event shall be less than three. The number
of directors may be decreased at any time and from time to time by a majority of
the directors then in office, but only to eliminate vacancies existing by reason
of the death, resignation, removal or expiration of the term of one or more
directors. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders
by such stockholders as have the right to vote on such election. The directors
need not be stockholders of the corporation.

         2.3 Terms of Office. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, each director shall hold
office until the next annual meeting and until his successor is elected and
qualified, or until he sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.

         2.4 Vacancies. Vacancies and any newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the number of directors may be filled by vote of the
holders of the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director at a meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the directors
then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, in

such directors. When one or more directors shall resign from the board,
effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office,
including those who have resigned, who were elected by the particular class or
series of stock entitled to elect such resigning director or directors shall
have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote or action by writing
thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become
effective. The Board of Directors shall be deemed to be duly constituted
notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership, whether because of the
failure of the stockholders to elect the full number of directors or otherwise.
Any such vacancy shall automatically reduce the number of directors pro tanto,
until such time as such vacancy has been filled in accordance with applicable
law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws, whereupon the number of
directors shall be automatically increased pro tanto.

         2.5 Resignation and Removal. Any director may resign by delivering his
or her written resignation to the corporation at its principal office or to the

other event. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, a director (including persons
elected by stockholders or directors to fill vacancies in the Board of
Directors) may be removed from office with or without cause by the vote of the
holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the particular
class or series entitled to vote in the election of such directors.

         2.6 Regular Meetings. The regular meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held without notice at such time and place, either within or without the
State of Delaware, as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of
Directors; provided, that any director who is absent when such a determination
is made shall be given notice of the determination. A regular meeting of the
Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after and at the same
place as the annual meeting of stockholders.

         2.7 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
held at any time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, designated

telephone at least twenty four (24) hours in advance of the meeting, (ii) by
sending a telegram, telecopy, electronic mail or other means of electronic
transmission, or delivering written notice by hand, to the director's last known
business or home address at least twenty four (24) hours in advance of the
meeting, or (iii) by mailing written notice to the director's last known

Directors need not specify the purposes of the meeting.

Directors may be held by conference telephone or similar communication
equipment, so long as all persons participating in the meeting can hear one
another; and all persons participating in such a meeting shall be deemed to be
present in person at the meeting.

         2.10 Quorum. A majority of the total number of the whole Board of
Directors shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the Board of Directors.
In the event one or more of the directors shall be disqualified to vote at any
meeting, then the required quorum shall be reduced by one for each such director
so disqualified; provided, however, that in no case shall less than one-third
(1/3) of the number of the whole Board of Directors constitute a quorum. In the
absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice, other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

         2.11 Action at Meeting. At any meeting of the Board of Directors at

alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent
provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, shall have
and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation and may authorize the
seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Each
such committee shall keep minutes and make such reports as the Board of
Directors may from time to time request. Except as the Board of Directors may
otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its
business, but unless otherwise provided by the directors or in such rules, its
business shall be conducted as nearly as possible in the same manner as is
provided in these By-Laws for the Board of Directors.

         2.14 Compensation of Directors. The directors may be paid such
compensation for their services and such reimbursement for expenses of
attendance at meetings as the Board of Directors may from time to time

corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and
records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a

examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other
books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a

to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court
may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and
all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies
or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other

of such notice either in writing signed by the person entitled to such notice or
such person's duly authorized attorney, or by telegraph, cable, electronic mail
or any other available method, whether before, at or after the time stated in
such waiver, or the appearance of such person or persons at such meeting in
person, by means of remote communications, if authorized, or by proxy shall be
deemed equivalent to such notice. Where such an appearance is made for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully
called or convened, the appearance shall not be deemed equivalent to notice.

         6.4 Checks; Drafts; Evidences of Indebtedness. From time to time, the
board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may
sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or

corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those
instruments.

         6.5 Corporate Contracts and Instruments; How Executed. The board of
directors, except as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, may authorize any
officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute
any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency
power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or
authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its
credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

         6.6 Evidence of Authority. A certificate by the Secretary, or an
Assistant Secretary under Section 3.11, or a temporary secretary under Section

between the corporation and one or more of the directors or officers, or between
the corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other
organization in which one or more of the directors or officers are directors or
officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for
this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the
Board of Directors which authorizes the contract or transaction or solely
because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

            (1) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and
as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee of the Board
of Directors in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the
affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the
disinterested directors be less than a quorum;

            (2) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and
as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or

            (3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of
the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a
committee of the Board of Directors, or the stockholders.

         Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee
which authorizes the contract or transaction.

         6.9 Construction; Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise,

identity of the person or persons may require.

         6.10 Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law. All restrictions,
limitations, requirements and other provisions of these By-Laws shall be
construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions
of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with
in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be
illegal.

         6.11 Provisions Contrary to Provisions of Law; Severability. Any
article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these
By-Laws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 6.10
hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of
law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect,
but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other
portions of these By-Laws, it being hereby declared that these By-Laws would
have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence,
clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more
articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is
or are illegal.

given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written
notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the
time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is
delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the
person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any
oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless, to the
recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving
the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.

By-Laws may be adopted, amended or repealed at any annual or special meeting of
