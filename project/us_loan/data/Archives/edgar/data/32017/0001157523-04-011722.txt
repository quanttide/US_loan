  ElkCorp Announces Improved Outlook for its Second Fiscal Quarter;
    Company Expects an Improvement of At Least 33 Percent Over its
                      Previous Quarterly Guidance

    DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 22, 2004--ElkCorp (NYSE:ELK)
announced today it expects earnings for its second fiscal quarter,
ending Dec. 31, 2004, to exceed the current guidance of $0.44 to $0.46
per diluted share by at least $0.15 per diluted share, bringing
expectations to approximately $0.60 per diluted share or more for the
quarter. The increased earnings expectations for the second quarter
are primarily due to improved pricing and increased volume for roofing
products across the majority of its markets, particularly in the
Southeastern region, as well as improved productivity at all plants,
assisting the Company in offsetting increasing transportation expenses
and continued high asphalt costs.
    "Since issuing guidance in October, we have seen demand in the
Southeast pick up more rapidly than we had anticipated and have seen
pricing for our products strengthen in the majority of our markets
throughout the country," commented Thomas Karol, chairman and chief
executive officer of ElkCorp. "Additionally, the improvements in
productivity we continue to make at all of our plants have assisted us
in better servicing the storm affected areas, including the successful
ramp-up of our new Tuscaloosa facility that continues to exceed our
original expectations."
    ElkCorp will release the results for its second fiscal quarter,
following the close of market on Jan. 20, 2005. The company will also
host a conference call to further discuss its earnings and operations
for the quarter as well as its expectations for fiscal year 2005 at
11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 21, 2005.
