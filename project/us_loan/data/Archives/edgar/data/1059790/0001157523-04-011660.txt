POZEN's MT 100 To Be Reviewed by Advisory Committee in May 2005

    CHAPEL HILL, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 21, 2004--FDA and POZEN
Inc. (NASDAQ: POZN) have agreed to present MT 100 to an Advisory
Committee for consideration, with particular emphasis on the potential
risk of tardive dyskinesia. A tentative date in May has been proposed.
This action came as a result of a series of meetings held between the
two parties. The FDA stated in a recent memo that it is possible that
MT 100 may not be approvable if the benefits of the drug do not, in
FDA's opinion, outweigh the risks of MT 100, including the risk of
tardive dyskinesia, even if FDA eventually determines that MT 100
meets the efficacy requirements for a combination migraine agent.
    MT 100 is a combination of two approved drugs, naproxen sodium and
metoclopramide hydrochloride, in a sequential release formulation.
POZEN received a not approvable letter from FDA on May 28, 2004 citing
a lack of evidence supporting both the efficacy and the safety of the
combination product. MT 100 is still under regulatory review in the
United Kingdom.
