Item 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Arrangement.

            On December 29, 2004, Viewpoint Corporation entered into an
            agreement with Robert E. Rice under which, among other things: (a)
            Mr. Rice will remain employed by Viewpoint as Executive Chairman for
            the period beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending on June 30, 2005
            at a salary of $165,000 for the semi-annual period payable in
            accordance with Viewpoint's standard payroll practices; (b) unless
            Mr. Rice's employment is terminated before June 30, 2005 for "cause"
            (as defined in the agreement) or Mr. Rice's employment is terminated
            by Mr. Rice before June 30, 2005 without "good reason" (as defined
            in the agreement), Viewpoint will pay to Mr. Rice $165,000 in
            semi-monthly installments over the period beginning in July 2005 and
            ending in December 2005 and the portion of an option (the "Option")
            to acquire 200,000 shares of Viewpoint common stock issued to Mr.
            Rice in November 2003 that had not vested by June 30, 2005 would
            vest on that date; (c) Mr. Rice would receive a payment equal to two
            times the rate of his annual salary and the unvested portion (if
            any) of the Option would vest if Viewpoint undergoes a "change in
            control" (as defined in the agreement) before September 1, 2005; and
            (d) the parties terminated an earlier agreement between Mr. Rice and
            Viewpoint under which Mr. Rice was entitled, among other things, to
            a payment equal to three times his base salary if Viewpoint
            completed a change in control transaction during Mr. Rice's
            employment.

            The terms of the agreement replace any benefits and payments that
            would have been due to Mr. Rice under an earlier employment
            agreement between the parties that terminates on December 31, 2004.

            For a complete description of the terms of the agreement, reference
            is made to the Employment Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
