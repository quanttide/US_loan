ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE ARRANGEMENT

            Viewpoint Corporation and EagleRock Master Fund, LP entered into a
            Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2004, under
            which Viewpoint issued 1,886,792 shares of Viewpoint common stock in
            a private placement to EagleRock at a purchase price of $2.65 per
            share (resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $4,999,998.80).

            The securities offered and sold in the private placement have not
            been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
            were sold in reliance upon the exemption from securities
            registration afforded by Regulation D. EagleRock represented to
            Viewpoint that it is an "Accredited Investor", as defined in Rule
            501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. In connection with the
            private placement, Viewpoint entered into a Registration Rights
            Agreement with EagleRock pursuant to which Viewpoint is required to
            file a registration statement with the SEC covering the shares
            within 30 days of the closing of the private placement.

            The foregoing is a summary of the terms of the Securities Purchase
            Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement and does not purport to
            be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
            full text of the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Registration
            Rights Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit
            10.1 and Exhibit 10.2.

            Viewpoint issued a press release announcing the transaction on
            December 22, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as
            Exhibit 99.1.
