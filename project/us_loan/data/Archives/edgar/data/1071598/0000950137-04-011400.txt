<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>On December&nbsp;17, 2004, Pac-West Telecomm, Inc. (&#147;Pac-West&#148;) entered into certain transaction
documents that, subject to certain conditions, are designed to collectively give effect to a
proposed sale by Pac-West of certain assets primarily related to its small- and medium-sized
enterprise business (the &#147;SME Business&#148;) and the assumption by U.S. TelePacific Corp.
(&#147;TelePacific&#148;) of certain specified liabilities related to the SME Business (the &#147;Sale
Transaction&#148;), and the provision by Pac-West of certain transition services to TelePacific designed
to facilitate an orderly migration of SME Business customers from Pac-West&#146;s network facilities to
TelePacific&#146;s network facilities. In addition, on December&nbsp;17, 2004, in a related transaction,
Pac-West entered into a payoff letter designed to provide for the prepayment by Pac-West of that
certain Senior Secured Promissory Note (the &#147;Senior Note&#148;) due December&nbsp;19, 2006 in the original
principal amount of $40,000,000 given by Pac-West to Deutsche Bank AG &#151; London (&#147;Deutsche Bank&#148;),
and the termination of the Warrant to acquire up to 26,666,667 shares of Pac-West&#146;s common stock
issued to Deutsche Bank (the &#147;Warrant&#148;) and Guaranty and Security Agreement related to the Senior
Note (&#147;Guaranty and Security Agreement&#148;), in each case, related to the Senior Note (the
&#147;Prepayment&#148;).</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The following is a description of the (1)&nbsp;Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December&nbsp;17, 2004,
between Pac-West and TelePacific (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;), (2)&nbsp;the Transition Services Agreement,
dated December&nbsp;17, 2004, between Pac-West and TelePacific (the &#147;Transition Services Agreement&#148;) and
(3)&nbsp;the Payoff Letter Agreement, dated December&nbsp;17, 2004, between Pac-West and Deutsche Bank, which
collectively give effect to the transactions described above. The descriptions below do not
purport to be a complete statement of the parties&#146; rights and obligations under the Purchase
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Payoff Letter and the transactions contemplated
therein. These descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Purchase
Agreement, Transition Services Agreement and Payoff Letter, respectively, a copy of each of which
is expected to be filed as an exhibit to Pac-West&#146;s Annual Report on </I><I>Form 10-K</I><I> for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Asset Purchase Agreement</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, Pac-West has agreed
to sell to TelePacific certain assets primarily related to the SME Business and TelePacific has
agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the acquired assets in exchange for cash
consideration of $27,000,000 (the &#147;Purchase Price&#148;), subject to a purchase price adjustment
mechanism described below, plus the aggregate amount of accounts receivable primarily related to
the SME Business collected by TelePacific within one hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days following the
closing of the Sale Transaction. TelePacific has agreed to assume certain liabilities associated
with the assets acquired and Pac-West will retain the liabilities not otherwise specifically
assumed by TelePacific. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Price is subject
to adjustment downward only based upon the amount by which actual average monthly billed revenue
for the SME Business for the two calendar months preceding the closing of the Sale Transaction is
less than $2,700,000. This adjustment mechanism will result in a decline of $1,000,000 in Purchase
Price for each $100,000 in actual monthly billed revenue achieved less than $2,700,000, subject to
a floor on the Purchase Price of $24,000,000 for a closing on or prior to February&nbsp;28, 2005,
$23,000,000 for a closing on or after March&nbsp;1, 2005 and before April&nbsp;1, 2005, $22,000,000 for a
closing on or after April&nbsp;1, 2005 and before May&nbsp;1, 2005 and $21,000,000 for a closing on or after
May&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, upon execution of this agreement, TelePacific will
simultaneously deposit $2,500,000 to be held as an earnest money deposit by Pac-West,


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;
</DIV>

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">and, to the extent TelePacific has not waived a condition to closing that the consent of one
of its principal lenders be obtained, TelePacific will deposit with Pac-West an additional
$1,000,000 as earnest money prior to the close of business on December&nbsp;22, 2004. Furthermore,
TelePacific has the right to deposit an additional $2,500,000 as earnest money in the event
TelePacific does not waive such closing condition prior to January&nbsp;6, 2005. If TelePacific does
not waive such closing condition or deposit an additional $2,500,000 as earnest money prior to
January&nbsp;6, 2005, Pac-West will be entitled to terminate the Purchase Agreement and retain the
earnest money. With the deposit of the additional $2,500,000, Pac-West will be unable to terminate
the Purchase Agreement in the event TelePacific does not waive such closing condition until January
28, 2005, at which time Pac-West will have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement and retain
the earnest money. If, prior to termination of the Purchase Agreement, TelePacific notifies
Pac-West in writing that it has waived such closing condition, Pac-West will be required to
promptly refund the entire earnest money deposit to TelePacific. Upon closing of the Sale
Transaction, Pac-West will also be required to credit any part of the
earnest money then still held by Pac-West towards
the Purchase Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides for customary representations and warranties by Pac-West and
TelePacific. Other than certain limited representations related to the
title of assets, which survive indefinitely, and representations related to tax matters, which
survive for sixty (60)&nbsp;days longer than any applicable statute of limitations, the representations
and warranties survive until the first anniversary of closing of the Sale Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides for certain covenants on the part of Pac-West, including a
covenant to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing of the Sale Transaction.
In addition, Pac-West will be subject to an exclusivity provision, which will place certain
limitations on its ability to solicit and enter into transactions involving a sale of its non-SME
Business assets or a controlling stock sale, and an absolute prohibition on soliciting and entering
into transactions involving a sale of its SME Business assets, in each case, between signing and
closing of the Sale Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Pac-West will be subject to a non-competition and
non-solicitation covenant, which will terminate three years after closing. The non-competition
covenant will prohibit Pac-West from engaging in any competing
business, which is generally defined as the
business of selling on a retail basis directly to small and medium-sized enterprise customers
telecommunications services of the type and nature sold on a retail basis directly to small and
medium-sized enterprise customers of the SME Business as of the closing of the Sale Transaction, in
California and Nevada. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the non-competition covenant provides that
Pac-West will not be prohibited from selling or providing any services to other direct providers of
telecommunications and telecommunications-related services, including CLECs, VARs or resellers,
IXCs, ISPs, ESPs, ASPs and paging companies. In addition, Pac-West
will generally not be prohibited from
providing such services to itself and its affiliates, directors, officers and employees.
TelePacific will be subject to a non-solicitation covenant, which will also terminate three years
after closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligations of TelePacific to close the Sale Transaction will be subject to certain
conditions, including the following: (i)&nbsp;Pac-West&#146;s representations and warranties are true and
correct in all material respects and Pac-West is in compliance in all material respects with all
covenants and agreements; (ii)&nbsp;the nonoccurrence of any events which could have a material adverse
effect; (iii)&nbsp;receipt of any required third-party consents, including required regulatory approvals
and landlord consent to the sublease of certain space in Pac-West&#146;s March Lane premises; and (iv)
no court or other governmental or administrative action having been commenced to prevent or
otherwise enjoin the execution, delivery or performance of the Purchase Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pac-West&#146;s obligations to close the Sale Transactions are subject to certain conditions,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">material respects and TelePacific&#146;s compliance in all material respects with all covenants and
agreements; (ii)&nbsp;receipt of any required third-party consents, including required regulatory
approvals and landlord consent to the sublease of certain space in Pac-West&#146;s March Lane premises;
and (iii)&nbsp;no court or other governmental or administrative action having been commenced to prevent
or otherwise enjoin the execution, delivery or performance of the Purchase Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purchase Agreement provides that Pac-West will generally indemnify TelePacific, its
affiliates, officers, directors and employees from liability or loss arising out of or resulting
from the following: (i)&nbsp;breach of any representation or warranty, agreement or covenant in
connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or any operative
document; (ii)&nbsp;any excluded liability; (iii)&nbsp;any claims by parties other than any TelePacific or
its Indemnified Persons to the extent caused by acts or omissions of Pac-West; (iv)&nbsp;any claims
arising out of any decree, judgment or order adjudicating Pac-West as bankrupt or otherwise
insolvent; (v)&nbsp;any claims arising out of the institution by Pac-West of proceedings to be
adjudicated a voluntary bankruptcy or similar restructuring or reorganization; and (vi)&nbsp;any of
Pac-West&#146;s taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pac-West will generally not be liable for any
loss unless the aggregate amount of losses exceeds $250,000, and then only to the extent of the
losses in excess of $250,000 up to a maximum liability, in most cases of $5,000,000. TelePacific
has agreed to indemnify Pac-West on a similar basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either Pac-West or TelePacific may terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the
closing of the Sale Transaction if: (i)&nbsp;by mutual consent; (ii)&nbsp;an event occurs that results in a
material adverse effect; (iii)&nbsp;any representations and warranties or covenants are not true and
correct in all material respects and the breaching party fails to cure such defect within the
defined cure period; (iv)&nbsp;if the closing does not occur by June&nbsp;30, 2005; or (vi)&nbsp;a government
authority takes an action to prohibit the sale transactions, which action is final and
nonappealable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Transition Services Agreement</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Transition Services Agreement provides that Pac-West will provide to TelePacific certain
pre-closing, support, and consulting services to ensure the continued operation of the SME Business
and assist in the efficient and timely transition of Pac-West&#146;s SME Business customers from
Pac-West&#146;s network facilities to TelePacific&#146;s network facilities. Under the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, the transition services will be provided for an initial term of one
year from the closing of the Sale Transaction, unless sooner terminated. The term can be extended
for additional increments of three months each, but may not exceed eighteen (18)&nbsp;months.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition services that will be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement
are generally categorized as the following: network management services, customer support
services, information technology and billing services, network related services, real estate
services, migration services, pre-closing services and certain agreed upon additional services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general matter, under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, transition services
will be provided to TelePacific at cost. TelePacific will be provided a credit of $2,000,000 for
network related services to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement. TelePacific&#146;s
obligation to pay Pac-West for certain network related services will be subject to a cap of
$10,500,000. In addition, network management services, customer support services, information
technology and billing services and network related services will be subject to a pricing floor,
which will require TelePacific to pay Pac-West a minimum amount each month for such services.
Certain services will be subject to a service level agreement, which, to the extent Pac-West fails
to perform at the established performance level, would result in a reduction in the amount to be
received in connection with providing such services.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Transition Services Agreement provides a limitation on liability to Pac-West as well as
other customary protections. As a general matter, Pac-West may not assign its obligations under
the Transition Services Agreement without the consent of TelePacific (which may not be unreasonably
withheld). However, TelePacific may generally refuse to consent to the assignment of Pac-West&#146;s
obligations under the Transition Services Agreement to the extent such assignment is to a direct
competitor of TelePacific and such assignment occurs within five months of the closing of the Sale
Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Payoff Letter</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payoff Letter provides that, in exchange for payment to Deutsche Bank of $40,750,000, the
Senior Note will be prepaid in full (including all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid
interest) and the Warrant and Guaranty and Security Agreement will be terminated in connection
therewith.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pac-West&#146;s obligation to prepay the Senior Note is expressly conditioned on the closing of the
Sale Transaction. Any obligations pursuant to the Payoff Letter will be terminated if the Purchase
Agreement is terminated, provided Pac-West complies with specified notification provisions. In the
event the Sale Transaction is not closed on or prior to April&nbsp;15, 2005, Deutsche Bank has the right
to terminate this Payoff Letter; provided, however, if failure of the Sale Transaction to close is
the result of the parties&#146; failure to obtain the necessary regulatory and governmental approvals,
the Payoff Letter&#146;s termination date is extended to the earlier of (i)&nbsp;June&nbsp;30, 2005 and (ii)&nbsp;the
date that is five business days following receipt of all governmental approvals. As part of the
Prepayment, Deutsche Bank will release its lien on the assets to be acquired by TelePacific as well
as authorize Pac-West to file any necessary financing statements or any Uniform Commercial Code
termination statements.
