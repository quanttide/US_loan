ITEM 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On December 21, 2004, the Board of Directors of Atlantic Coast Federal, the
savings institution subsidiary of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, adopted
the 2005 Executive Non-Qualified Excess Plan (the "2005 Plan"). This plan
replaced the existing Executive Non-Qualified Excess Plan (the "Existing Plan")
which was frozen as to new contributions and/or deferrals earned following
December 31, 2004. Accrued benefits under the Existing Plan will continue to be
covered by such plan. All future benefits will be covered by the 2005 Plan that
was drafted to comply with the new Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
which was created by the American Jobs Creation Act that was signed into law on
October 22, 2004. The 2005 Plan is intended to be an unfunded non-tax qualified
plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation
benefits for directors of Atlantic Coast Federal.
