<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, Great Wolf Resorts, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the &#147;Company&#148; or the &#147;Registrant&#148;), in connection with the
previously-announced completion of its initial public offering of common stock
(the &#147;Public Offering&#148;), executed a Revolving Credit Agreement, by and among
the Company, GWR Operating Partnership, L.L.L.P., the Subsidiary Guarantors
named therein, Citicorp North America, Inc., Societe Generale, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., SG Americas Securities LLC and Calyon
New York Branch (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;). The Credit Agreement provides for
borrowings by the Company of up to $75&nbsp;million from time to time and also provides
that two of the Company&#146;s resort properties will secure the Company&#146;s
obligations thereunder. The interest rate is equal to LIBOR plus a
margin of 2.25% to 3.00% depending upon the Company&#146;s leverage
ratio from time to time. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December&nbsp;20,
2007, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. As of the date
of closing of the Public Offering, the Company had no amounts drawn under the
Credit Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement includes, among other things, certain financial and
operating debt covenants, including: (i)&nbsp;requiring the Company to meet
financial tests based upon its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;a maximum amount of indebtedness the Company
may incur under the Credit Agreement at an advance rate of 3.75 multiplied by
the combined net operating income (adjusted for non-recurring items, unusual
items, infrequent items and asset impairment charges) of the two resorts
securing the Credit Agreement; (iii)&nbsp;a maximum level of the amount of the Company&#146;s
total debt equal to 5.75 times the Company&#146;s total EBITDA (adjusted for
non-recurring items, unusual items, infrequent items, non-cash employee
compensation expense and asset impairment charges and adjusted to reflect an
estimated full year of operating results for resorts open less than a year);
(iii)&nbsp;a minimum interest coverage ratio, representing the Company&#146;s total
EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring items, unusual items, infrequent items,
non-cash employee compensation expense and asset impairment charges and
adjusted to reflect an estimated full year of operating results for resorts
open less than a year) divided by the Company&#146;s total interest expense, of 2.0;
and (iv)&nbsp;a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, representing the Company&#146;s
total EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring items, unusual items, infrequent
items, non-cash employee compensation expense and asset impairment charges and
adjusted to reflect an estimated full year of operating results for resorts
open less than a year) divided by the Company&#146;s total fixed charges, of 1.5.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement also contains certain restrictions on the Company&#146;s
operations, including:

in connection with the Public Offering, on December&nbsp;20, 2004, two of the
Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries owning resort properties in Kansas City, Kansas and
Traverse City, Michigan entered into a Loan Agreement with Citigroup Global
Markets Realty Corp. and The Travelers Insurance Company (the &#147;Kansas/Traverse
Mortgage&#148;). The maturity date is January 11, 2015.
Pursuant to the Kansas/Traverse Mortgage, the Company agreed to
guarantee the due and punctual payment of the subsidiaries&#146; obligations under
the Kansas/Traverse Mortgage. Events of default applicable to the Company pursuant to the
Kansas/Traverse Mortgage include the Company making an assignment for the
benefit of creditors; if a receiver, liquidator or trustee shall be appointed
for the Company or if the Company shall be adjudicated as bankrupt or
insolvent. In addition, the Kansas/Traverse Mortgage contains customary events of default
applicable to the subsidiary borrowers. Upon the occurrence of any
such event of default, the lenders may (and in certain instances,
shall) declare all unpaid principal, interest and fees outstanding
immediately due and payable. The maximum obligation which could be
incurred by the Company under this guarantee is $75 million. The annual interest rate under the Kansas/Traverse Mortgage is equal to 5.835% with respect to $50 million of the outstanding principal amount, and 9.21% with respect to $25 million of the outstanding principal amount. The
lenders under the Kansas/Traverse Mortgage generally have the right to proceed against
the Company directly to collect payments due under the Kansas/Traverse Mortgage.
