ITEM 3.02 SALE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.

Shares Issued on Conversion of Preferred Stock

         As previously reported, effective as of January 29, 2004, Fonix
Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Series I 8% Convertible Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Series I Agreement") with The Breckenridge Fund,
LLC ("Breckenridge"). Under the Series I Agreement, the Company issued a total
of 3,250 shares of its Series I 8% Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series I
Preferred Stock"), which are convertible into shares of the Company's common
stock according to the terms and conditions set forth therein.

         In December 2004, the Company received a conversion notice from
Breckenridge converting 250 shares of the Series I Preferred Stock into shares
of the Company's Common Stock. On December 15, 2004, the Company issued
2,132,196 shares of Common Stock to Breckenridge in connection with the
conversion the shares of Series I Preferred Stock.

         Prior to December 2004, in three separate transactions, Breckenridge
had converted an aggregate of 250 shares of Series I Preferred Stock, and in
connection with such conversions, the Company had issued an aggregate of
2,054,863 shares of Common Stock to Breckeridge in connection with the
conversions.

         The shares of common stock were issued to Breckenridge under the Series
I Agreement without registration under the 1933 Act in reliance on Section 4(2)
of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including
Regulation D. The issuance was made in connection with a private offering under
the Agreement, and no public solicitation or offering was made. The resales of
the shares by Breckenridge were registered under a registration statement on
Form S-2. Breckenridge is identified as an underwriter in the registration
statement with respect to the shares it receives in connection with the
Agreement.

         The Company did not receive any proceeds at the time of the conversions
of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock.

Shares Issued as Payment of Interest

         As previously reported, on February 24, 2004, the Company closed the
previously announced acquisition of all of the capital stock of LTEL Holdings
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("LTEL"). The acquisition of the LTEL
capital stock (the "Acquisition") was consummated pursuant to an Exchange
Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") dated as of February 24, 2004 among Fonix,
Fonix Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Fonix ("LTEL Acquisition"), LTEL and the stockholders of LTEL
identified therein (the "Sellers"). In connection with the Acquisition, the
Company paid to the Sellers non-cash negotiated consideration of $33 million.
The terms of the Acquisition and the consideration received by the Sellers were
the result of arm's-length negotiations between us and the Sellers.

         In connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued a note (the
"Note") to two of the Sellers in the Acquisition. In connection with the Note,
the Company and the Sellers agreed that the Company could issue

         The shares of common stock were issued to Kenzie under the Exchange
Agreement and the Note without registration under the 1933 Act in reliance on
Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, including Regulation D. The issuance was made in connection with a
private offering under the Exchange Agreement, and no public solicitation or
offering was made. The resales of the shares by Kenzie were registered under a
