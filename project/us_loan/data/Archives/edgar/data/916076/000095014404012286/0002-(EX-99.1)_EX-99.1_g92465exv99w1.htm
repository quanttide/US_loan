<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC.,<BR>
ANNOUNCES JOINT VENTURE WITH HUNT MIDWEST</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">RALEIGH, North Carolina (December&nbsp;21, 2004) &#150; Martin Marietta Materials today announced that it
has formed a joint venture company with Hunt Midwest Enterprises to operate substantially all of
the aggregates facilities of both companies in Kansas City and surrounding areas. The joint
venture Company, Hunt Martin Materials, is 50%-owned by each party, and Martin Marietta will act
as managing partner. With production of approximately 7.5&nbsp;million tons per year, the new joint
venture company is the leading aggregates producer in the area.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Commenting on the transaction, Stephen P. Zelnak stated, &#147;This approach will enable us to
substantially improve the cost structure of the operations involved, which is essential in a
highly competitive marketplace. We are pleased to be able to work with Hunt Midwest to create
an approach that will be of significant benefit to both companies. We expect that the joint
venture will be neutral to slightly accretive to Martin Marietta&#146;s earnings in 2005.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Hunt Midwest Mining, Inc. is a subsidiary of Hunt Midwest Enterprises, Inc., a diversified
development company owned by Lamar Hunt and his family. The Hunts also operate two Kansas City
professional sports teams: the Chiefs of the National Football League and the Wizards of Major
