                         VALLEY FORGE SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

                FISCAL 2004 AND FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS

OAKS, Pa., December 22, 2004 -- Valley Forge Scientific Corp. (NASDAQ: VLFG;
BSE: VLF), a leading developer of bipolar electrosurgical systems, today
announced operating results for fiscal 2004 and fourth quarter ended September
30, 2004.

     Sales for the 2004 fiscal year of $4,756,439 were 6% greater than sales of
$4,474,308 for the 2003 fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $111,420, or
$0.01 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $108,925, or
$0.01 per basic and diluted share, for fiscal 2003.

     Sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 of $1,149,810 were 6% greater
than sales of $1,083,358 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net loss for the
quarter was $34,144, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net
income of $1,840, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003.

     While sales volume of neurosurgical products decreased slightly in fiscal
2004, sales of dental products increased and a contribution from sales to
Stryker Corporation for demonstration units further contributed to sales volume.
As announced on October 25, 2004, Valley Forge Scientific entered into a five
year supply and distribution agreement with Stryker Corporation regarding the
lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain.

     For the 2004 fiscal year, sales to Codman & Shurtleff, Inc. accounted for
$4,099,000, or 86% of sales, as compared to $4,231,000, or 95% of sales, for
fiscal 2003. Included in sales to Codman & Shurtleff, Inc. for fiscal 2004 is a
one-time payment of $57,920 in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 that Codman &
Shurtleff, Inc. made to satisfy its minimum purchase obligation under the first
three month extension of an existing distribution agreement.
<PAGE>

     For the 2004 fiscal year, sales of dental products increased to
approximately $422,000, or 9% of sales, from approximately $185,000, or 4% of
sales, in fiscal 2003. Sales of dental products of $35,250 in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004, however, decreased as compared to sales in the third quarter of
fiscal 2004 as more resources were directed towards the completion of a new
lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain and the distribution
arrangement with Stryker Corporation for that product. For fiscal 2005, product
modifications and other strategies for dental products are being considered.

     Sales for the fiscal 2004 year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 also
reflect sales to Stryker Corporation, which include sales of demonstration units
of the lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain, in the amounts
of $189,160 and $52,500, respectively, as compared to no sales in fiscal 2003.

     For fiscal 2004, gross margin was 51% of sales, as compared to 49% of sales
for fiscal 2003. The difference in gross margin is primarily attributable to an
increase in sales.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2004 were
$1,713,325, or 36% of sales, as compared to $1,523,751, or 34% of sales, for
fiscal 2003. This increase reflects increased expenses incurred in connection
with implementing the sales and marketing plan, commenced in fiscal 2003, for
dental products and increased transactional legal fees incurred during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

     Research and development expenses were $508,287, or 11% of sales, for
fiscal 2004 as compared to $489,930, or 11% of sales, for fiscal 2003. The
increase was primarily related to the continued development of a new
multifunction bipolar electrosurgical generator and instrumentation and the
completion of the lesion generator for use in the percutaneous treatment of
pain.

     As previously announced, in conjunction with planning for fiscal 2005 and
beyond, Valley Forge Scientific entered into a new agreement with Codman &
Shurtleff on October 15, 2004 for the sale of existing products in the fields of
neurocranial and neurospinal surgery, which extends the business relationship
<PAGE>

through December 31, 2005. Under the agreement, Codman continues to be the
exclusive worldwide distributor of Valley Forge Scientific's existing products
through March 31, 2005 and the nonexclusive distributor until December 31, 2005,
as those terms may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Valley Forge
Scientific also entered into an option agreement with Dr. Leonard I. Malis,
which provides the right to acquire his Malis(R) trademark over a period of up
to five years. Valley Forge Scientific is also in process of negotiating a lease
for new office space to consolidate operations into a single location.

     "In fiscal 2005 and beyond, we plan to expand the market for our products
with our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generator and single-use
hand switching bipolar instruments, new products based on our proprietary lesion
generator technology and other products and product refinements. We feel the new
agreements we have entered into and other strategies and alliances we are
pursuing will propel our Company to greater heights in fiscal 2005 and beyond,"
said Jerry Malis, President and CEO of Valley Forge Scientific Corp.

     Management of Valley Forge Scientific will discuss fiscal fourth quarter,
and fiscal year ending September 30, 2004 financial results on Wednesday,
December 22, 2004 in a conference call scheduled for 10:30 a.m. ET. Those who
