<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On October 19, 2004, the Registrant
announced that it was delaying the release of its financial results for the quarter ended
September 30, 2004 because the Registrant and its outside auditors were reconsidering the
length of the revenue recognition period for contracts that included an Internet-based
information reporting system (the Company&#146;s online Progress Tracker system or its
predecessor). </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Audit Committee, at the
suggestion of management, has now determined that the Registrant&#146;s revenue
recognition treatment for such contracts should be changed. Historically, the Registrant
recognized revenue from transactions that included both a software license and the right
to use an online data system over different periods for the different components of the
transaction. The change will cause the Company to recognize revenue from all components
included in such historical transactions ratably over the customer support period
specified in the contract. These changes affect most of the Company&#146;s K-12 school
contracts, and are not restricted to multi-year transactions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Accordingly, on December 15, 2004,
the Audit Committee of the Registrant concluded that the Registrant&#146;s audited and
unaudited financial statements for the years 2000 through 2003 (and the quarterly periods
during those years) and the first two quarters of 2004, which were included in the
Registrant&#146;s previously-filed Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q,
should not be relied upon. The Audit Committee discussed this conclusion with the
Registrant&#146;s independent public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As soon as practicable, the Company
will file an amended Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and amended
reports on Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of 2004 to include restatements of the
financial statements included in those reports to reflect this change in revenue
recognition practices. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 17, 2004, the Company

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Oakland, CA, December 17, 2004 &#151;
Scientific Learning (NASDAQ: SCILE) today announced that it has decided to change its
revenue recognition practices for certain customer agreements. As a result, the Company
will restate its historical financial statements for the period from 2000 through June 30,
2004. Although the analysis and auditing has not been completed, the Company anticipates
the following directional changes in adjusted revenue and net income: </FONT></P>

</TABLE>
<BR>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The decision to restate results from
the previously announced discussions between the Company and its outside auditors about
the revenue recognition period for transactions that include the Company&#146;s online
Progress Tracker information tracking and reporting system or its predecessor.
Historically, the Company recognized revenue from transactions that included both a
software license and the right to use an online data system over different periods for the
different components of the transaction. The change will cause the Company to recognize
revenue from all components included in such historical transactions ratably over the
customer support period specified in the contract. These changes affect most of the
Company&#146;s K-12 school contracts, and are not restricted to multi-year transactions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As previously stated, the Company
presently expects that the restatement will result in a decrease in revenue for 2000 and
2001, an increase in revenue for 2002 and 2003 and a decrease in revenue for the first two
quarters of 2004. The Company anticipates that net loss will increase in 2000 and 2001,
net loss will decrease in 2002, and net income will increase in 2003, with a greater
percentage impact on income/loss than on revenue, because the Company&#146;s incremental
margins are relatively high. In the first two quarters of 2004, the restatement may result
in direct costs decreasing more than revenue, because service costs were lower in previous
years. Therefore, the first quarter&#146;s net loss may change to net income and net
income may be higher in the second quarter, even though revenue is expected to decline in
both quarters. Because of this pending restatement, investors should not rely upon the
historical financial statements previously issued for the periods being restated. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The issue that led to the restatement
is a technical accounting issue; there have been no suggestions of improprieties or
misconduct. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We are working diligently with
our outside auditors, and we will report our restated financials and announce our third
quarter results as soon as possible,&#148; said Robert C. Bowen, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer. &#147;This change in revenue recognition has no impact on our cash flow
or whether our sales can be reported as revenue. It has no impact on the ultimate profit
we earn from our sales over time. The issue is solely an issue of timing. We remain
enormously optimistic about the future of this business for our customers, shareholders
and employees.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As previously announced, the Company
delayed the release of the financial results for its third quarter, ended September 30,
2004. The Company expects to release these results upon the completion of the audit of the
restated historical financials. As soon as practicable, the Company will amend its Report
on Form 10-K for 2003 and its Reports on Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of 2004 and
will file its report on Form 10-Q for the 2004 third quarter. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company currently believes that
the only adjustments to its financial statements that will be required are adjustments to
reflect the change in revenue recognition described above and related costs. The
projections of the estimated financial impact of the revenue recognition change are the
Company&#146;s current best estimates, based on its current knowledge. It is possible,
however, that in the process of completing and auditing the restated financial statements,
other adjustments may be required or other issues will be brought to the Company&#146;s
attention that will make these estimates incorrect. </FONT></P>
