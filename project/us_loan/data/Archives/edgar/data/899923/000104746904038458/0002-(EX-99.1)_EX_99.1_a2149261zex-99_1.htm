<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Salt Lake City, December&nbsp;28, 2004</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Myriad Genetics,&nbsp;Inc. (Nasdaq: MYGN), announced today
that it has submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA to begin a Phase I human clinical trial with MPC-2130 (previously referred to as MPI-176716), a
broad-acting inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Phase I clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of MPC-2130 in patients with advanced metastatic tumors or blood cancers as well as
refractory cancer that has progressed despite previous chemotherapy. In preclinical studies MPC-2130 has demonstrated significant cancer cell killing activity in ovarian cancer, prostate
cancer and two lymphoma cell lines, Burkitt's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. MPC-2130 was also evaluated in xenograft mouse models of ovarian cancer and prostate
cancer. The drug candidate reduced growth of ovarian cancer tumors by 61% relative to controls. MPC-2130 was also effective in demonstrating a significant reduction in tumor volumes in
mice implanted with human prostate cancer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MPC-2130
is our second investigational drug for cancer to enter the clinic using the apoptotic pathway and fighting cellular proliferation by causing cancer cells to
self-destruct. However, our two cancer compounds are very different and function at independent points in the apoptosis pathway," said Adrian Hobden, Ph.D., President of Myriad
Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. "Not only does each compound demonstrate preclinical attributes that provide it with potentially broad utility in metastatic cancer, but the two drug candidates also
display their best potencies against different cancer types." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Multiple Drug Resistance  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly, MPC-2130 was shown to be highly effective in cancer cell lines that are resistant to multiple drugs. Cancer cells may become resistant to
chemotherapy through a cellular function that actively purges drug from the cell. The function is carried out by MDR pumps and is the primary cause of cancers' resistance to many marketed drugs such
as paclitaxel and vinblastine. MPC-2130 was tested to determine its susceptibility to MDR pumps, and was shown to be equally effective in anti-cancer activity against the MDR
cell lines tested, suggesting that the drug candidate is not a substrate for MDR pumps. </FONT></P>

to the potential safety and pharmacokinetic profile of MPC-2130, the potential of MPC-2130 to treat cancers of the ovary, prostate and lymphomas, the submission of
MPC-2130 to the FDA as an IND and moving MPC-2130 into human clinical trials, the potential broad utility of MPC-2130 in metastatic cancer, the expected completion
of the clinical study periods in the Phase II trial of the Company's Alzheimer's disease drug candidate in the first quarter of calendar 2005 and in the Phase II/III trial of its prostate cancer drug
candidate in the second quarter of 2006, and the potential to move additional late-stage programs in the fields of HIV and CINV into human clinical trials within the next 12&nbsp;months.
