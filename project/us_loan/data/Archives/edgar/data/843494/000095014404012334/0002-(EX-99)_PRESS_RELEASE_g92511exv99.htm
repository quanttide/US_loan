<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">CENUCO TERMINATES OMNIPOINT ACQUISITION AGREEMENT


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Monday, December&nbsp;20, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BOCA RATON, Fla. &#150; December&nbsp;20, 2004&#151;Cenuco, Inc. (AMEX:ICU &#151; News) today announced it has
terminated the agreement to acquire Omnipoint Marketing LLC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Steven Bettinger, CEO of Cenuco, commented, &#147;Cenuco&#146;s board and management have come to the
decision that pursuing this acquisition any further is no longer in the best interests of our
company or our stockholders. Cenuco continues to remain focused on its strategy to expand its
wireless video monitoring business.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cenuco recently announced its initial carrier deployment of MobileMonitor(sm) through First
Cellular of Southern Illinois. MobileMonitor allows consumers and business owners to see live video
of their home or office right through their cellular handset, no matter where they are. The
MobileMonitor product is carrier agnostic, and has been BREW certified by Qualcomm, as well as
Windows Mobile certified by Microsoft for Pocket PC phones, and the entire Smart Phone platform.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is in advanced discussions with additional carriers for further deployment of its core
technology.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, Cenuco is negotiating with a major provider of electronic security services to
commercial, government and residential customers throughout the United States to license and
install Cenuco&#146;s technology for wireless video monitoring.
