and Classic Bancshares, Inc. Announce Merger </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>CHARLESTON, West Virginia &#150; City
Holding Company (Cross Lanes, West Virginia) (Nasdaq: CHCO) and Classic Bancshares, Inc.
(Ashland, Kentucky) (Nasdaq: CLAS) announced today the execution of a definitive agreement
for City Holding to acquire Classic and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Classic Bank. Classic
is a $340 million commercial bank that operates ten full-service branches located in Boyd,
Carter, Greenup and Johnson Counties in Kentucky and Lawrence County in Ohio. City Holding
and Classic anticipate that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of
2005, pending regulatory approvals, the approval of the shareholders of Classic and
completion of other customary closing conditions. The directors of Classic have agreed to
vote their shares in favor of the merger. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Under the terms of the agreement,
shareholders of Classic will receive .9624 shares of City common stock (valued at $35.42,
based on City&#146;s December 28, 2004 closing price of $36.80 per share), and $11.08 in cash for each share
of Classic common stock owned by them. Additionally, Classic has agreed to sell or have
repaid a $4 million performing commercial loan prior to the closing date of the
transaction, and has further agreed that if that loan is sold or repaid for less than its
legal balance, shareholders of Classic will receive a proportionate reduction in the cash
received. While Classic management believes the loan will be sold or repaid for its legal
balance, the cash received by shareholders in the merger could range between $9.47 and
$11.08 per share depending on the results of the sale or repayment of the loan. The total
transaction value is estimated at $77.4 million (assuming that outstanding stock options
for 109,435 shares held by directors of Classic will be cashed out at the difference
between the merger consideration and the exercise price of the options and stock options
for 210,385 shares will be exercised prior to the closing). </FONT></P>
