<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Merger Agreement</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(&#147;Black Box&#148;), SF Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Black Box (&#147;Purchaser&#148;), and Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota
corporation (&#147;Norstan&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will commence a
tender offer (the &#147;Offer&#148;) for all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, $0.10 par value per share (the &#147;Company Common Stock&#148;), of
Norstan, including the associated common stock purchase rights (the &#147;Rights,&#148;
and referred to collectively with the Company Common Stock as the &#147;Shares&#148;), at
a price equal to $5.60 per Share, net to the seller in cash (or any higher
price per Share paid in the Offer) (the &#147;Per-Share Amount&#148;), without interest,
and subject to applicable withholding taxes. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, following a successful completion
of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into Norstan with Norstan
surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Black Box (the &#147;Merger&#148;).
In the Merger, each Share (other than Shares owned by Black Box, Purchaser or
shareholders, if any, who have perfected statutory dissenters&#146; rights under
Minnesota law) will be converted into the right to receive the Per-Share
Amount, without interest, and subject to applicable withholding taxes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of
Shares, together with any Shares then owned by Black Box or Purchaser
(including Shares subject to the Voting and Tender Agreement, defined and
discussed below), that, immediately prior to acceptance for payment pursuant to
the Offer, represents at least a majority of the sum of (a)&nbsp;the aggregate
number of Shares immediately prior to acceptance for payment, plus (b)&nbsp;the
aggregate number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of any option, warrant,
other right to acquire capital stock of the Company, or other security
exercisable for or convertible into Shares or other capital stock of the
Company, any of which is outstanding immediately prior to acceptance for
payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Voting and Tender Agreement</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the directors and
officers of Norstan (the &#147;tendering shareholders&#148;) also entered into a Voting
Tender and Voting Agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;20, 2004 (the &#147;Voting and
Tender Agreement&#148;), with Purchaser and Black Box. As of December&nbsp;20, 2004, the
tendering shareholders collectively owned 636,019 Shares, excluding unvested
shares of restricted stock (approximately 5% of the Shares then outstanding)
directly or through affiliates. The tendering shareholders have agreed to
tender to Purchaser in the Offer all of the Shares that each of them owns,
including any Shares which such tendering shareholder acquires ownership of
after the date of the Voting Tender Agreement and prior to the termination of
the Voting Tender Agreement, including any Shares of unvested restricted stock
upon an event causing such Shares to vest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Voting and Tender Agreement also grants each of Black Box and
Purchaser an irrevocable option to purchase each outstanding Share owned by the
tendering shareholders at the Per-Share Amount. Black Box or Purchaser may
exercise this option at any time after the expiration of the Offer and until
the earlier of the effectiveness of the Merger or the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Furthermore, each tendering
shareholder has agreed, at any meeting of the shareholders of Norstan, to vote
all Shares (a)&nbsp;in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and any transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (b)&nbsp;against any alternative
transaction proposal and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(c)&nbsp;against any action that would delay, prevent or frustrate the Offer
and the Merger and the related transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. The number of Shares subject to the foregoing restrictions may not
exceed 19.9% of the Shares outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Stock Option Agreement</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;20, 2004, by
and among Black Box, Purchaser and Norstan (the &#147;Option Agreement&#148;), the
Company has granted to Purchaser an irrevocable option to purchase, at the
Per-Share Amount, that number of Shares necessary for Purchaser to obtain
ownership of at least 90% of the outstanding Shares on an a fully diluted
basis. Purchaser&#146;s exercise of this option is conditioned upon Purchaser and
Black Box owning, immediately prior to any exercise of the Option Agreement, an
aggregate of at least 80% of the Shares and, immediately following such
exercise, at least 90% of the Shares. Purchaser may exercise this option at
any time, or from time to time, after the expiration of the Offer until the
earlier of immediately following the effectiveness of the Merger or the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Amendment to Rights Plan</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, the Company entered into an Amendment No.&nbsp;3 to
Rights Agreement (the &#147;Rights Plan Amendment&#148;) with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the &#147;Rights Agent&#148;). The Rights Plan Amendment amends the
Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Rights Agreement with the Rights Agent,
originally dated as of April&nbsp;1, 1998 (as first amended on February&nbsp;28, 1999,
and second amended on March&nbsp;23, 2001) (the &#147;Rights Plan&#148;). The Company&#146;s board
of directors approved the Rights Plan Amendment on December&nbsp;20, 2004, in order
to exempt Black Box, Purchaser, and the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Option Agreement and the
Voting and Tender Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby) from
the offering persons and transactions triggering an issuance of Rights under
the Rights Plan. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated without
consummation of the Merger contemplated thereby, Black Box (or any other person
attempting to engage in a takeover transaction) would again become an offering
person that would trigger an issuance of Rights under the Rights Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>Term Sheets and New Severance Agreements</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of Ms.&nbsp;Warner and Messrs.&nbsp;Christian, Vold, Laughlin, Anderson and
Perry (collectively, the &#147;Executives&#148;) have signed term sheets outlining
compensation plans for the period after the effective time of the Merger (the
&#147;Term Sheets&#148;) and will enter into new severance agreements with Black Box, to
be effective as of such effective time (the &#147;New Severance Agreements&#148;), which
will terminate their existing employment agreements and existing severance
agreements. The obligations to and of Messrs.&nbsp;Baszucki, Van Beusekom and
Lehrman under their existing agreements, including their change-of-control
arrangements, will continue to apply after the Merger. The Company is a party
to the Term Sheets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Term Sheets provide that the Executives will continue to receive their
existing base salaries through the fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, 2006, and will
be eligible for bonuses which may be awarded pursuant to bonus, incentive or
similar plans. The Term Sheets also provide that, subject to Black Box
shareholder approval, the foregoing Executives will receive grants of
non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock of Black Box in
the amount of 20,000 shares (50,000 shares in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Christian), each
with a three-year vesting schedule. Each Executive, other than Mr.&nbsp;Christian,
is subject to a one-year non-competition and non-solicitation agreement
effective upon termination of employment. Mr.&nbsp;Christian will be subject to a
two-year non-competition and non-solicitation agreement effective upon
termination of employment.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the New Severance Agreements, the Executives will waive and
render inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, the change-in-control provisions in their
existing agreements. In addition, the New Severance Agreements will provide
that, if there is a change in control of Black Box prior to the three-year
anniversary of the Effective Time, or an Executive&#146;s employment is terminated
without cause prior to the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Executive shall be entitled to receive a severance payment in an amount equal
to such Executive&#146;s annual base salary rate in effect on the date of
termination, plus incentive bonus. In the event an Executive is terminated
without cause after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, such
Executive will be entitled to severance pay (except in the case of a change in
control) equal to one year (in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Christian), nine months (in the
case of Mr.&nbsp;Vold) or six months (in the case of the other Executives) of base
salary or the Surviving Corporation&#146;s then-current severance policy, whichever
is greater. The New Severance Agreements will further provide that each of the
Executives will receive a retention bonus for remaining in the employ of the
Surviving Corporation after the Merger. Mr.&nbsp;Christian&#146;s retention bonus will
be $714,000, payable in three installments of $238,000 each. The other
Executives will receive a retention bonus in an amount equal to 50% of the
amount payable under their existing severance agreements upon a qualifying
change in control payable in four equal installments in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Vold,
or three equal installments in the case of the other Executives.
