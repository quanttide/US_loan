            (2) is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
      understanding with the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
      unless the terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or
      understanding are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted
      Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who
      are not Affiliates of the Company; and

            (3) is a Person with respect to which neither the Company nor any of
      its Restricted Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect obligation (A) to
      subscribe for additional Equity Interests or (B) to maintain or preserve
      such Person's financial condition or to cause such Person to achieve any
      specified levels of operating results.

      Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a
certified copy of the Board Resolution giving effect to such designation and an
Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the provisions of Section 4.07 hereof.
If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding
requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it shall thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Guarantee Agreement and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be incurred as of such date under the provisions of Section 4.09
hereof, the Company shall be in default of such Section. The Board of Directors
of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an
incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation
shall only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred
under the provisions of Section 4.09 hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis as
if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference
period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following
such designation.

      "Voting Stock" of any Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of
such Person that is at the time entitled to vote in the election of the Board of
Directors of such Person.

      "Weighted Average Life to Maturity" means, when applied to any
Indebtedness at any date, the number of years obtained by dividing:

                                       36
<PAGE>

            (1) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (A) the amount
      of each then remaining installment, sinking fund, serial maturity or other
      required payments of principal, including payment at final maturity, in
      respect of the Indebtedness, by (B) the number of years (calculated to the
      nearest one-twelfth) that will elapse between such date and the making of
      such payment; by

            (2) the then outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness.

      (a) Subject to this Article 3, the Company hereby unconditionally
guarantees to each Holder of a Series 2003A Bond and to the Trustee and its
successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this
Guarantee Agreement, the Indenture, the Series 2003A Bonds or the obligations of
the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:

            (1) the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the
      Series 2003A Bonds shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at
      maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise;

            (2) the purchase price of the Series 2003A Bonds payable pursuant to
      Section 2.02 of the Indenture shall be promptly paid when due; and

            (3) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any
      Series 2003A Bonds or any of such other obligations, the same shall be
      promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms
      of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
      or otherwise.

      Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason,
the Company will obligated to pay the same immediately. The Company agrees that
this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.

      (b) The Company hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder are
unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the
Series 2003A Bonds, the Indenture or this Guarantee Agreement, the absence of
any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the
Series 2003A Bonds with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the
recovery of any judgment against PEDFA or the Seward Subsidiary, any action to
enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. The Company hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of PEDFA or the Seward Subsidiary, any
right to require a proceeding first against PEDFA or the Seward Subsidiary,
protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that the REI Guarantee
will not be discharged except by complete performance of the payment obligations
contained in Section 3.01(a).

      (c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any custodian, trustee,
liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or
the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such
Holder, the REI Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect.

      (d) The Company agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of
subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed
hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. The Company
further agrees that, as between the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders
and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations
guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in the Indenture for the
purposes of the REI Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations
guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of
such obligations as provided in the Indenture, such obligations (whether or not
due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Company for the
purpose of the REI Guarantee. The Company will have the right to seek
contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of
such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the REI Guarantee.

      The Company, and by its acceptance of Series 2003A Bonds, each Holder,
hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the REI
Guarantee of the Company not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for
purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent
applicable to any REI Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the
Trustee, the Holders and the Company hereby irrevocably agree that the
obligations of the Company will be limited to the maximum amount that will,
after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed
liabilities of the Company that are relevant under such laws, and after giving
effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments
made by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations
of such Subsidiary Guarantor under Article 12 of this Guarantee Agreement,
result in the obligations of the Company under its REI Guarantee not
constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the action or event
giving rise to the release of the REI Guarantee pursuant to Section 3.04(a) has
occurred or was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this
Guarantee Agreement, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required
in order to evidence the release of the Company from its obligations under the

to the Holders.

Section 4.06 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws.

      The Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors covenants (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) that they shall not at any time insist upon, plead,

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

            (2) the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and
      after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had
      been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have
      been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional

                                       42
<PAGE>

      Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in
      Section 4.09(a) hereof; and

            (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of
      all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its Restricted
      Subsidiaries after July 1, 2003 (excluding Restricted Payments permitted

            first full fiscal quarter since July 1, 2003 to the end of the
            Company's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal
            financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted
            Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a
            deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus

                  (B) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the
            Company since July 1, 2003 as a contribution to its common equity

            convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Company that have
            been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other
            than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities)
            sold to a Subsidiary of the Company), plus

                  (C) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made
            after July 1, 2003 is sold for cash or otherwise liquidated or
            repaid for cash, the lesser of (i) the cash return with respect to
            such Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any)
            and (ii) the initial amount of such Restricted Investment, plus

                  (D) 50% of any cash received by the Company or a Restricted
            Subsidiary of the Company after July 1, 2003 from an Unrestricted
            Subsidiary of the Company, to the extent that such cash was not
            otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income of the Company for
            such period and did not result in an increase in the amount
            available for future Permitted Investments, plus

                  (E) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the
            Company is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after July 1,
            2003, the Fair Market Value of the Company's Investment in such
            Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation.

      (b) The provisions of Section 4.07(a) hereof shall not prohibit:

            (1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of
      declaration of the dividend, if at the date of declaration the dividend
      payment would have complied with the provisions of this Guarantee
      Agreement;

            (2) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or would be
      caused thereby, the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or
      out of the net cash proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other
      than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of, Equity Interests of
      the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or of the substantially
      concurrent contribution of common equity capital or surplus to the
      Company, provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are
      utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or
      other acquisition shall be excluded from clause (3)(B) of Section 4.07(a)
      hereof;

                                       43
<PAGE>

            (3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of
      Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is
      subordinated to the REI Guarantee or to any Subsidiary Guarantee with the
      net cash proceeds from a substantially concurrent incurrence of Permitted
      Refinancing Indebtedness;

            (4) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership
      or limited liability company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted
      Subsidiary of the Company to the holders of its Equity Interests on a pro
      rata basis;

      caused thereby, (A) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or
      retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Company or any
      Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in connection with any management
      equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, shareholders'
      agreement, severance agreement, employee benefit plan or agreement or
      similar agreement or (B) the repurchase for value of any Equity Interests
      of the Company in the open market to satisfy stock options issued by the
      Company that are outstanding; provided that the aggregate price paid for
      all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests after
      the Issue Date may not exceed $25.0 million in any calendar year (or the
      pro rata portion thereof for the calendar year 2004);

            (6) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the
      exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a

Section 4.09 Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.

      (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee
or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise,
with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Debt), and the Company shall not issue any Disqualified Stock and shall not
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred
stock; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including
Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and the Subsidiary Guarantors may
incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock, if the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full
fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available
immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred
or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least
2.0 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred
or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may
be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

      (b) The provisions of Section 4.09(a) will not prohibit the incurrence of
any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt"):

      in Qualified Securitization Transactions in an aggregate principal amount
      at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) (with letters of credit
      being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential
      liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder),
      including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund,
      refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause
      (1), not to exceed the greater of:

                  of Excluded Subsidiaries, REMA and its Subsidiaries or the
                  Seward Subsidiary ) that have been made by the Company or any
                  of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date;

                        (ii) the aggregate amount, without duplication, of all
                  commitment reductions with respect to any revolving credit
                  borrowings under a Credit Facility that have been made by the
                  Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than
                  Credit Facilities of Excluded Subsidiaries, REMA and its
                  Subsidiaries or the Seward Subsidiary) since the Issue Date;
                  and

                        (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
                  incurred pursuant to clause (5) of this Section 4.09(b)
                  (including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to
                  refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred
                  pursuant to such clause (5)) that is at the time outstanding;

            (3) [Reserved];

            (4) the incurrence by REMA and its Subsidiaries of additional
      Indebtedness and letters of credit under Credit Facilities of REMA or any
      of its Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
      outstanding under this clause (4) (with letters of credit being deemed to
      have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of REMA
      and its Subsidiaries thereunder), including all Permitted Refinancing
      Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness
      incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed $60.0 million;

            (5) the incurrence by the Company and/or the Seward Subsidiary of
      (A) Permitted PEDFA Bond Indebtedness (including the Bonds) and/or the

      (including the Seward Bond Guarantees) or (B) Indebtedness evidenced by or
      in support of the Seward Tax-Exempt Bonds, in an aggregate principal
      amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (5), including all
      Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or
      replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (5), without
      duplication, not to exceed $600.0 million less the aggregate amount of all
      repayments, optional or mandatory, of the principal of any Indebtedness
      incurred pursuant to this clause (5) that have been made by the Company
      and/or the Subsidiary Guarantors and/or the Seward Subsidiary since the
      Issue Date;

            (6) [Reserved];

            (7) [Reserved];

            (8) the issuance of Specified Junior Securities by the Company,
      including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund,
      refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause
      (8); provided that at least 50% of the net proceeds of such issuance
      (other than proceeds that are used by the Company or any Subsidiary
      Guarantor to acquire Permitted ERCOT Assets) are applied to the repayment
      of term Indebtedness under the Company's Credit Facilities; provided,
      further, that if there is any change in the terms of such Specified Junior
      Securities that results in such securities no longer meeting all of the
      requirements of the definition of "Specified Junior Securities," then such
      change will be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by the
      Company that was not permitted by this clause (8);

            (9) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of
      the Existing Indebtedness, including the Existing Convertible Notes, the

      of design, construction, installation or improvement of property, plant or
      equipment used in the business of the Company or any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal amount,

                                       48

            (13) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and
      any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

                  (a) if the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor
      on such Indebtedness and (i) the payee is not the Company or a Subsidiary
      Guarantor or (ii) such Indebtedness constitutes Excluded Securities, such
      Indebtedness (except Permitted PEDFA Bond Indebtedness) must be expressly
      subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then
      due with respect to the REI Guarantee, in the case of the Company, or the
      Subsidiary Guarantee, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor; and

                  (b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity
      Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person
      other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (ii)
      any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is
      not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (except

      not permitted by this clause (13);

            (14) the incurrence by any Subsidiary Guarantor of any Guarantee of

            (15) the issuance by any of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries to
      the Company or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of shares of

      that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than
      the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and

                  (b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to
      a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
      Company,

      shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred

      that was not permitted by this clause (15);

            (16) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted

      performance and surety bonds provided by the Company or a Restricted
      Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business;

            (18) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other
      financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument
      inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such
      Indebtedness is covered within five business days;

            (19) the incurrence of Indebtedness arising from agreements of the
      Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification,
      adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case,
      incurred or assumed in connection with the disposition of any business,
      assets or Equity Interests of a Subsidiary; provided that the maximum
      aggregate liability in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time
      exceed the gross proceeds (including non-cash proceeds) actually received
      by the Company and/or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such
      disposition;

            (20) the Guarantee by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of
      Indebtedness that was permitted to be incurred by Section 4.09(a) hereof
      or clauses (8), (11) or (21) of this Section 4.09(b); and

            (21) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount
      (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding pursuant to
      this clause (21), including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
      incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred
      pursuant to this clause (21), not to exceed $500.0 million (which may, but
      need not, be incurred under a Credit Facility).

      The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to,
incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or
that Subsidiary Guarantor (except Permitted PEDFA Bond Indebtedness) unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the REI
Guarantee or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee on substantially identical
terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness of the Company shall be deemed to
be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of
the Company solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on
a junior basis.

      For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, in the
event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one
of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (21) of
Section 4.09(b) hereof, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section
4.09(a) hereof, the Company shall be permitted to classify such item of
Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify from time to
time all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies
with this Section 4.09. Indebtedness under Credit Facilities outstanding on the
Issue Date shall initially be deemed to have been incurred on such date in
reliance on the exception provided by clauses (1), (4) and (9) of Section
4.09(b) hereof, as applicable, and all Permitted PEDFA Bond Indebtedness,
including the Bonds, the Loan Agreements and the Seward Bond Guarantees, and
other Indebtedness evidenced by or in support of the Seward Tax-Exempt Bonds
outstanding on the Issue Date shall initially be deemed to have been incurred on
such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (5) of Section 4.09(b)
hereof. The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified
Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock
shall not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of
Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 4.09; provided, in each such
case, that the amount

                                       50
<PAGE>

thereof is included in Fixed Charges of the Company as accrued. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Section 4.09, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this Section
4.09 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in
exchange rates or currency values.

Section 4.11 Transactions with Affiliates.

      (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract,
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate of the Company (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless:

            (1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less
      favorable (as reasonably determined by the Company) to the Company or the
      relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in
      a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with
      an unrelated Person; and

            (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee:

                  (A) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
            related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in
            excess of $25.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors set
            forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate
            Transaction complies with this Section 4.11(a) and that such
            Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
            disinterested members of the Board of Directors; and

                  (B) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
            related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in

            Company or such Restricted Subsidiary of such Affiliate Transaction
            from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or
            investment banking firm of national standing.

      (b) The following items shall not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions

hereof:

            (1) any employment agreement or director's engagement agreement,
      employee benefit plan, officer and director indemnification agreement or

      Subsidiaries;

            (3) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Company
      solely because the Company owns, directly or through a Restricted
      Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;

            (4) payment of reasonable directors' fees to Persons who are not
      otherwise Affiliates of the Company;

      Issue Date or any amendment thereto or any transaction contemplated
      thereby (including pursuant to any amendment thereto) in any replacement
      agreement thereto so long as any such amendment or replacement agreement
      is not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect than
      the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date as determined by the
      Company;

            (10) any pro rata distribution (including a rights offering) to all
      holders of a class of Equity Interests or Indebtedness of the Company or
      any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including Persons who are Affiliates

      ancillary services, transmission services and products, steam, emissions
      credits, fuel, fuel transportation and fuel storage in the ordinary course
      of business on terms that are no less favorable (as reasonably determined
      by the Company) to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary of
      the Company than those that would have been obtained in a comparable
      transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated
      Person.

Section 4.12 Liens.

      The Company shall not and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise
cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind on any asset
now owned or hereafter acquired, except Permitted Liens.

Section 4.13 Line of Business.

      The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted

      Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company shall do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect:

            (1) its corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other
      existence of each of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective
      organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of
      the Company or any such Subsidiary; and

            (2) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of
      the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company
      shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or

                                       52
<PAGE>

      Subsidiaries, if (a) the Company shall determine that the preservation
      thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the
      Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof
      is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Series 2003A
      Bonds and (b) if a Subsidiary is to be dissolved, such Subsidiary has no
      assets.

Section 4.15 Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control.

      (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company shall make an
offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder to repurchase all or any part
(equal to $100,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000 in excess of $100,000) of
each Holder's Series 2003A Bonds at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the
Series 2003A Bonds repurchased, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of
Control Payment"). Within thirty days following any Change of Control, the
Company shall mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control and stating:

            (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this
      Section 4.15 and that all Series 2003A Bonds tendered will be accepted for
      payment;

            (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which date will be no
      earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice
      is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date");

            (3) [Reserved];

            (4) [Reserved];

            (5) that Holders electing to have any Series 2003A Bonds purchased
      pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the
      Series 2003A Bonds to the paying agent at the address specified in the
      notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding
      the Change of Control Payment Date;

            (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if such
      paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second
      Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram,
      telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the
      Holder, the principal amount of Series 2003A Bonds delivered for purchase,
      and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the
      Series 2003A Bonds purchased; and

            (7) [Reserved].

      The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Series 2003A Bonds as a result of a Change in Control. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
the provisions of Section 4.15 of this Guarantee Agreement, the Company shall
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.15 by virtue of
such conflict.

      (b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the
extent lawful:

            (1) accept for payment all Series 2003A Bonds or portions of Series
      2003A Bonds properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

                                       53
<PAGE>

            (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of
      Control Payment in respect of all Series 2003A Bonds or portions of Series
      2003A Bonds properly tendered; and

            (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Series 2003A
      Bonds properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the
      aggregate principal amount of Series 2003A Bonds or portions of Series
      2003A Bonds being purchased by the Company.

      The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control
Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

      (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.15, the
Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at
the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this
Section 4.15 hereof and purchases all Series 2003A Bonds properly tendered and
not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has
been given pursuant to the Indenture unless and until there is a default in
payment of the applicable redemption price.

Section 4.16 Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.

      The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, enter into any sale and leaseback transaction; provided that
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may enter into a sale and leaseback
transaction if:

            (1) the Company or that Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, could
      have incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt
      relating to such sale and leaseback transaction under the provisions of
      Section 4.09 hereof; and

            (2) the gross cash proceeds of that sale and leaseback transaction
      are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the property that is the
      subject of that sale and leaseback transaction.

      The preceding restrictions shall not apply to a sale and leaseback
transaction entered into between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or
between Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

Section 4.17 Payments for Consent.

      The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any monetary
consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any
consent under or waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this
Guarantee Agreement unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid
to all Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth
in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

Section 4.18 Additional Subsidiary Guarantees.

      If after the Issue Date but before the Seward Security Event the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or creates another Domestic
Subsidiary that is required to become a guarantor of any borrowings under the
Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness of the Company, or any Excluded
Subsidiary ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary, then that Domestic Subsidiary or
former Excluded Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Guarantor and (A) execute a
supplemental guarantee agreement substantially in the form as Exhibit A hereto
and a joinder agreement to the Security Documents in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee providing that such Subsidiary shall
become a

                                       54
<PAGE>

Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement and a party as grantor to
the Security Documents and (B) deliver an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the
Trustee, in each case, within 30 Business Days of the date on which it was
required to become a guarantor of any borrowings under the Credit Agreement or
any other Indebtedness of the Company, or any Excluded Subsidiary ceases to be
an Excluded Subsidiary.

Section 4.19 Changes in Covenants When Series 2003A Bonds Rated Investment
Grade.

      If on any date following the Issue Date:

      (a) the rating assigned to the Series 2003A Bonds by either S&P or Moody's
is an Investment Grade Rating, and

      (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following
paragraph, the provisions of Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.11, 4.20 and clause
(4) of Section 5.01 hereof shall be suspended.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the ratings assigned by both such rating
agencies with respect to the Series 2003A Bonds should subsequently decline to
below an Investment Grade Rating, the provisions of Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09,
4.11, 4.20 and clause (4) of Section 5.01 hereof shall be reinstituted as of and
from the date of such rating decline. The provisions of Section 4.07 hereof
shall be interpreted as if they had been in effect since July 1, 2003 except
that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted
Payment made or declared (and later made) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 4.07(b)(1) while the provisions of such Section were suspended.

Section 4.20 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

      The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated shall be deemed to
be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and shall reduce the
amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.07(a) hereof or under
the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That
designation shall only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that
time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary.

Section 4.21 Reserved.

Section 4.22 Insurance.

      The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall maintain with financially
sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance on their property and assets
(including the Shared Collateral) in at least such amounts, with such
deductibles and against at least such risks as is customary for companies of the
same or similar size engaged in the same or similar businesses as those of the
Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and furnish to the Collateral Trustee,
upon written request, full information as to its property and liability
insurance carriers. Holders of Bonds, as a class, will be named as an additional
insured on all liability insurance policies of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Collateral Trustee will be named as loss payee on all
property and casualty insurance policies of each such person.

Section 4.23 Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness.

      (a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that
any intercompany Indebtedness or other intercompany receivables, intercompany
payables or intercompany advances directly or indirectly made by or owed to the
Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor by any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company,
as applicable, of whatever nature at any time outstanding shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in
cash of the Seward Guarantee Obligations. Each of the Company and the Subsidiary
Guarantors hereby agrees that it shall not become obligated or otherwise liable
for any intercompany Indebtedness, or other intercompany receivable,
intercompany payable or intercompany advance that is owed to any Person other
than the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless such Person agrees that
such Indebtedness, receivable, payable or advance (as applicable) is completely
subordinated to the Seward Guarantee Obligations and subject in right of payment
to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Seward Guarantee
Obligations, and that no payment on any such Indebtedness, receivable, payable
or advance shall be made by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor until the
earliest to occur of: (i) satisfaction and discharge of the Series 2003A Bonds
pursuant to the Indenture, (ii) defeasance of the Series 2003A Bonds pursuant to
the Indenture or (iii) payment in full in cash of all Seward Guarantee
Obligations that are outstanding, due and payable at the time the Series 2003A
Bonds are paid in full in cash (for purposes of this Section 4.23, only,
collectively the "Termination Date"); except: intercompany receivables,
intercompany payables, intercompany advances and intercompany Indebtedness made
to, or on behalf of, any Person, other than the Company or any Subsidiary
Guarantor, permitted pursuant to the terms hereof may be paid or repaid, in each
case so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any intercompany
Indebtedness or other intercompany receivable, intercompany payable or
intercompany advance with a Person, other than the Company or any Subsidiary
Guarantor, where such Person is expressly prohibited from agreeing to the
foregoing subordination pursuant to the terms and provisions of the definitive
credit documentation with respect to Indebtedness of such Person for borrowed
money listed on Schedule 7.3(k) to the Credit Agreement.

      (b) In the event that any payment on any such intercompany Indebtedness,
receivable, payable or advance shall be received by the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor other than as permitted by Section 4.23(a) before the
Termination Date, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, shall
receive such payments and hold the same in trust for, segregate the same from
its own assets and shall immediately pay over to, the Collateral Trustee for the
benefit of the holders of Parity Secured Debt all such sums to the extent
necessary so that the holders of Parity Secured Debt shall have been
indefeasibly paid in full, in cash, all Seward Guarantee Obligations owed or
which may become owing.

lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole in a transaction

hereof, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into or with
which the Company is merged or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for
(so that from and after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease,
conveyance or other disposition, the provisions of this Guarantee Agreement
referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the successor corporation and
not to the Company), and may exercise every right and

                                       57

Bonds except in the case of a sale of all of the Company's assets in a
transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the provisions of,
Section 5.01 hereof.

Section 6.01 Events of Default.

      Each of the following is an "Event of Default":

            (1) the default in the payment when due of the principal or purchase
      price of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2003A Bonds, after
      any applicable grace periods;

            (2) [Reserved];

            (3) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to
      comply with the provisions of Sections 4.15 or 5.01 hereof for 30 days
      after notice to the Company from the Trustee or the Holders of at least
      25% in the aggregate principal amount of Series 2003A Bonds then
      outstanding;

            (4) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to

      Series 2003A Bonds then outstanding;

            (5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which

      Subsidiaries so long as, taken together, they would not constitute a
      Significant Subsidiary and (B) Reliant Energy Retail Holdings, LLC or its
      successor or any Subsidiary thereof in connection with a Qualified
      Securitization Transaction (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the
      Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness
      or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that
      default:

                  (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal or purchase price
      of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness after the
      expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date
      of such default (a "Payment Default"); or

                  (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to
      its express maturity,

      and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together

      accelerated, aggregates $50.0 million or more;

            (6) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
      pay final and non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of $50.0
      million, which are not covered by

<PAGE>

      indemnities or third-party insurance, which judgments are not paid,
      discharged, vacated or stayed for a period of 60 days;

            (7) the repudiation by the Company or any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries of any of its obligations under any of the Security Documents
      or the Seward Security Documents or the unenforceability of any of the
      Security Documents or the Seward Security Documents against the Company or
      any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any reason if such unenforceability
      is applicable to Collateral having an aggregate Fair Market Value of $50.0
      million or more;

            (8) any Security Document or Seward Security Document or any Lien
      purported to be granted thereby on assets having a Fair Market Value in
      excess of $50.0 million is held in any judicial proceeding to be
      unenforceable or invalid, in whole or in part, or ceases for any reason
      within the control of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
      (other than pursuant to a release that is delivered or becomes effective
      as set forth in this Guarantee Agreement) to be fully enforceable and
      perfected;

            Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Guarantee Agreement, the
Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this
Guarantee Agreement without the consent of any Holder:

            (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

            (4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or
      benefits to the Holders, including the addition of guarantees, or that

      of any such Holder;

            (5) [Reserved];

            (6) to make, complete or confirm any grant of Collateral permitted
      or required by the Security Documents, the Seward Security Documents, the

            (7) to conform the text of this Guarantee Agreement to any provision
      of the Description of the Guarantees to the extent that such provision in
      the Description of the Guarantees was intended to be a verbatim recitation
      of a provision of this Guarantee Agreement;

            (8) to reflect any waiver or termination of any right arising under
      the provisions of Section 11.01 hereof that otherwise would be enforceable
      by any holder of any Series of Secured Debt other than the Series 2003A

the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of any amended or
supplemental guarantee agreement authorized or permitted by the terms of this

                                       62
<PAGE>

      (a) Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the
Trustee may amend or supplement this Guarantee Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 4.15 hereof) with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2003A Bonds then
Outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with
a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Series 2003A Bonds),
and any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of
Default in the payment of the principal or purchase price of, premium or
interest on the Series 2003A Bonds, except a payment default resulting from an
acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this
Guarantee Agreement may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal aggregate amount of the then Outstanding Series 2003A Bonds
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
for, or purchase of, the Series 2003A Bonds).

      Upon the written request of the Company and upon the filing with the
Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of
Series 2003A Bonds as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the
documents described in Section 9.06 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the
Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental guarantee agreement
unless such amended or supplemental guarantee agreement directly affects the
Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Guarantee Agreement or
otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be
obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental guarantee agreement.

      It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02
to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it is
sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

      After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice
briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the
Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any
way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental guarantee
agreement or waiver.

      Subject to Section 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Series 2003A Bonds then Outstanding may waive compliance
in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Guarantee
Agreement. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or
waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Seward Guarantee
relating to Series 2003A Bonds held by a non-consenting Holder):

            (1) reduce the principal amount of Series 2003A Bonds whose Holders
      must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

            (2) [Reserved];

            (3) [Reserved];

            (4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal
      or purchase price of, or interest or premium on such Seward Guarantee
      (except a rescission of acceleration of the Series 2003A Bonds by the
      Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series
      2003A Bonds and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
      acceleration);

            (5) make any Seward Guarantee payable in money other than that
      stated in this Guarantee Agreement;

                                       63
<PAGE>

            (6) make any change in the provisions of this Guarantee Agreement
      relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Series
      2003A Bonds to receive payments of principal or purchase price of, or
      interest or premium on the Series 2003A Bonds;

            (7) [Reserved]; or

            (8) make any change in Section 6.07 hereof or in the foregoing
      amendment and waiver provisions.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guarantee Agreement, no
amendment or supplement to the provisions of Article 11 hereof may be made in a
manner which conflicts with the provisions of Section 11.04 hereof.

      (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guarantee Agreement, no
amendment or supplement to the provisions of Article 13 hereof may be made in a
manner which conflicts with the provisions of Section 13.09 hereof.

Section 9.03 Reserved.

Section 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents.

      Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to
it by a Holder of a Series 2003A Bond is a continuing consent by the Holder of a
Series 2003A Bond and every subsequent Holder of a Series 2003A Bond or portion
of a Series 2003A Bond that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's
Series 2003A Bond, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Series
2003A Bond. However, any such Holder of a Series 2003A Bond or subsequent Holder
of a Series 2003A Bond may revoke the consent as to its Series 2003A Bond if the
Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver,
supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver
becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every
Holder.

Section 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.

      The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental guarantee agreement
authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.
In executing any amended or supplemental guarantee agreement, the Trustee will
be entitled to receive and will be fully protected in relying upon, in addition
to the documents required by Section 12.04 hereof, an Officer's Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental
guarantee agreement is authorized or permitted by this Guarantee Agreement.

      Subject to Article 13 of this Guarantee Agreement, the payment of (i) the
REI Guarantee and all other Parity Secured Obligations, (ii) interest on overdue
principal or purchase price of, premium and interest on all other Parity Secured
Obligations, (iii) the performance of all other obligations of the

Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Guarantee Agreement, according
to the terms hereunder, and (iv) the performance of all other obligations of the
Company under the Secured Debt Documents are secured Equally and Ratably by
liens upon the Company's rights in the Shared Collateral. The payment of the
Subsidiary Guarantees of each Subsidiary Guarantor and all other Obligations of
such Subsidiary Guarantor, when due, and the performance of all other
Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Secured Debt Documents are
secured Equally and Ratably by Liens upon such Subsidiary Guarantor's rights in
the Shared Collateral.

Section 10.02 Collateral.

      (a) The REI Guarantee is secured, together with the Credit Agreement Debt,
all other Parity Secured Debt of the Company and all other Parity Secured
Obligations of the Company, Equally and Ratably by security interests granted to
the Collateral Trustee in all of the assets of the Company that secure Credit
Agreement Obligations, except Excluded Property. Each Subsidiary Guarantee is
secured, together with each Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee of the Credit
Agreement Debt, all other guarantees of Parity Secured Debt of each Subsidiary
Guarantor and all other Parity Secured Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor,
Equally and Ratably by security interests granted to the Collateral Trustee in
all assets of each Subsidiary Guarantor that secure its guarantee of the Credit
Agreement Obligations except Excluded Property. As provided in and limited by
the Security Documents, such security interests are junior in priority to
Permitted Prior Liens.

      (b) The assets securing Credit Agreement Obligations and guarantees of
Credit Agreement Obligations, excluding Excluded Property, consist of
substantially all of the operating assets of the Company and the Subsidiary
Guarantors owned as of the Issue Date or at any time thereafter acquired,
subject to Permitted Liens ("Shared Collateral"), including, without limitation,
as of the Issue Date:

            (1) mortgages on 13 electric generating plants with a net generating
      capacity of approximately 8,455 megawatts and related rights of way;

            (2) the outstanding Capital Stock of Reliant Energy Retail Holdings,
      LLC, which through its Subsidiaries is engaged in the retail energy
      business;

            (3) the outstanding Capital Stock of Orion Power Holdings, Inc.,
      which through its Subsidiaries owns and operates 10 electric generating
      plants with a net generating capacity of approximately 5,400 megawatts
      located in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia;

            (4) the outstanding Capital Stock of REMA, which owns or leases,
      together with its subsidiaries, 19 electric generating plants with a net
      generating capacity of approximately 3,732 megawatts located in
      Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland; and

            (5) substantially all of the inventory, equipment, accounts, general
      intangibles and other personal property of the Subsidiary Guarantors,
      except Excluded Securities.

      The Shared Collateral does not include any of the assets of the Excluded
Subsidiaries and does not include the Orion Intercompany Notes.

      The Shared Collateral also does not include certain assets that are
subject to various contractual or legal restrictions on liens or were otherwise
permitted by the holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations to be excluded from
the Liens securing the Credit Agreement Obligations, including (1) certain
receivables and related accounts of certain Subsidiary Guarantors that are in
the retail energy business, which are subject to a receivables securitization
program and are owned by a Securitization

                                       65
<PAGE>

Entity, and (2) proceeds from the issuance of Seward Tax-Exempt Bonds or
Permitted PEDFA Bond Indebtedness (including the Bonds) that secure the Seward
Tax-Exempt Bonds or Permitted PEDFA Bond Indebtedness.

      As provided in Article 13 hereof, upon the occurrence of the Seward
Security Event, the REI Guarantee will cease to constitute Parity Secured Debt.
Immediately after the Seward Security Event, none of the Credit Agreement, the
2014 Notes, the Existing Notes or the Seward Bond Guarantees will be secured by
liens on the Shared Collateral. At no time thereafter will the REI Guarantee be
secured by security interests in the Shared Collateral, even if as a result of a
subsequent action the Credit Agreement, the 2014 Notes or the Existing Notes
thereafter again become secured by Liens on all or a portion of the Shared
Collateral.

Section 10.03 Further Assurances.

      (a) At all times prior to the occurrence of the Seward Security Event, the
Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall do or cause to be done all acts and
things which may be required, or which the Collateral Trustee from time to time
may reasonably request, to assure and confirm that the Collateral Trustee holds
Equally and Ratably, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the
Series 2003A Bonds and holders of the other Parity Secured Debt duly created,
enforceable and perfected Liens (subject to Permitted Prior Liens) upon all
property, whether real, personal (including after-acquired personal property) or
mixed, of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors that is subject to any Lien
securing any other Series of Secured Debt, except Permitted Separate Liens upon
Excluded Property.

      (b) If the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors at any time prior
to the Seward Security Event owns or acquires any property that is subject to a
Lien securing any Parity Secured Debt (except Permitted Separate Liens upon
Excluded Property), but is not subject to a valid, enforceable perfected Lien
(subject to Permitted Prior Liens) in favor of the Collateral Trustee as
security Equally and Ratably for all of the Parity Secured Obligations, then the
Company shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary Guarantor if and to the extent
required under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Facility of the Company
to, concurrently:

            (1) execute and deliver to the Collateral Trustee a security
      document upon substantially the same terms as the Security Documents
      delivered in connection with the issuance of the Seward Bond Guarantees or
      other terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company or such Subsidiary
      Guarantor and the Collateral Trustee acting at the direction of the Credit
      Agreement Agent, granting a Lien upon such property to the Collateral
      Trustee for the benefit of the holders of Parity Secured Obligations,
      Equally and Ratably;

            (2) cause the Lien granted in such security document to be duly
      perfected in any manner permitted by law and cause each other Lien that
      secures Indebtedness upon such property to be (A) released, unless it is a
      Permitted Lien, or (B) subordinated to the Collateral Trustee's Liens if
      it is not a Permitted Prior Lien; and

            (3) deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Trustee any opinion of
      counsel delivered to or for the benefit of any Series of Secured Debt
      relating to such Security Document or the Lien granted therein.

      (c) Upon the written request of the Collateral Trustee at any time and
from time to time, the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver such Security Documents, instruments,
certificates, notices and other documents and take such other actions as shall
be required or which the Collateral Trustee may reasonably request to grant,
perfect or maintain the priority

conferred as contemplated by the Secured Debt Documents and the Security
Documents for the benefit of the holders of the Parity Secured Obligations.

      (b) Anything contained in any of this Guarantee Agreement and the Security
Documents and, after the occurrence of the Seward Security Event, the Seward
Security Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, each Holder hereby agrees
that no Holder or the Trustee shall have any right individually to realize upon
any of the Shared Collateral, it being understood and agreed that all powers,

is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of
them.

      (d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor shall ever assert any

                                       70
<PAGE>

Section 12.01 Guarantee.

      (a) Subject to this Article 12, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby,
jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Series
2003A Bond authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its
successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this
Guarantee Agreement, the Indenture, the Series 2003A Bonds or the obligations of
the Company hereunder or thereunder, that the payments required to be made by
the Company pursuant to Section 3.01(a) hereof shall be promptly paid in full
when due.

      Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason,
the Subsidiary Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the
same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of
payment and not a guarantee of collection.

      (b) The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations
hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Series 2003A Bonds, the Indenture or this Guarantee
Agreement, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent
by any Holder of the Series 2003A Bonds with respect to any provisions hereof or
thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce
the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a
proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever
and covenant that this Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by
complete performance of the payment obligations contained in Section 3.01(a) of
this Guarantee Agreement.

      (c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any custodian, trustee,
liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or
the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such
Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall
be reinstated in full force and effect.

      (d) Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any
right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations
guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.
The Subsidiary Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any
non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not
impair the rights of the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantee.

Section 12.02 Limitation on Subsidiary Guarantor Liability.

      Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Series 2003A Bonds,
each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that
the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform
Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar
federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To
effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Subsidiary
Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect
to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such
Subsidiary Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect
to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by
or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of
such other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Article 12, result in the obligations
of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Section 12.03 Execution and Delivery of Guarantee Agreement.

      To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 12.01, each
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that this Guarantee Agreement shall be
executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by one of its Officers.

      In the event that the Company creates or acquires any Domestic Subsidiary
after the Issue Date, if required by Section 4.18 hereof, the Company shall
cause such Domestic Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of Section 4.18
hereof and this Article 12, to the extent applicable.

Section 12.04 Subsidiary Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.

      Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.05, no Subsidiary Guarantor may
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or
consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor
is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Company or another
Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

            (1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default
      or Event of Default exists; and

            (2) either:

                  (a) subject to Section 12.05 hereof, the Person acquiring the
      property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or
      surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of
      that Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement and all Security
      Documents delivered by that Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to a
      supplemental guarantee agreement; or

                  (b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are
      applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Collateral
      Trust Agreement.

      In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the
assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental guarantee agreement,
executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee,
of this Guarantee Agreement and the due and punctual performance of all of the
covenants and conditions of this Guarantee Agreement to be performed by the
Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted
for the Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein
as a Subsidiary Guarantor. All the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued will in all
respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Guarantee Agreement as
the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with
the terms of this Guarantee Agreement as though all of such Subsidiary
Guarantees had been issued on the Issue Date.

      Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding
clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Guarantee Agreement will
prevent any consolidation or merger of a Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the
Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance
of the property of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor.

      5. PROTECTION OF THE MORTGAGEE'S SECURITY. If the Mortgagor fails to
perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Instrument, or if any
action or proceeding is commenced which affects the Mortgaged Property or title
thereto or the interest of the Mortgagee therein, including, but not limited to,
eminent domain, insolvency, code enforcement, or arrangements or proceedings
involving a bankrupt or decedent, and such proceeding has or is reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, then the Mortgagee may make such
appearances, disburse such sums and take such action as the Mortgagee deems
necessary to protect the Mortgagee's interest, including, but not limited to,
(i) disbursement of reasonable attorneys' fees, (ii) entry upon the Property to
make repairs, (iii) procurement of satisfactory insurance, and (iv) the payment
of any Impositions levied against the Property then due and payable. Any amounts
disbursed by the Mortgagee pursuant to this paragraph 5, with interest thereon,
shall become additional indebtedness of the Mortgagor secured by this
Instrument. Such amounts shall be immediately due and payable and shall bear
interest from the date of disbursement until the date of actual payment of such
amounts at the Default Rate. The Mortgagor hereby covenants and agrees that the
Mortgagee shall be subrogated to the lien of any mortgage or other lien
discharged, in whole or in part, by the indebtedness secured hereby. Nothing
contained in this paragraph 5 shall require the Mortgagee to incur any expense
or take any action hereunder.

                                      B-6
<PAGE>

      6. CONDEMNATION. The Mortgagor shall promptly notify the Mortgagee of any
threatened or pending Condemnation Event, whether direct or indirect, affecting
the Property, or any part thereof, and the Mortgagor shall appear in and
prosecute any such action or proceeding unless otherwise directed by the
Mortgagee in writing. Upon the occurrence and during the pendancy of an
Actionable Default the Mortgagor authorizes the Mortgagee, acting upon an Act of
Secured Debtholders, as attorney-in-fact for the Mortgagor, to commence, appear
in and prosecute, in the Mortgagee's or the Mortgagor's name, any action or
proceeding relating to any Condemnation Event applicable to the Property or any
part thereof, whether direct or indirect, and to settle or compromise any claim
in connection with such condemnation or other taking.

      7. MORTGAGOR AND LIEN NOT RELEASED. From time to time, subject to the
provisions of the relevant Secured Debt Documents, each Secured Party may, at
its option, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of the Mortgagor,
the Mortgagor's successors or assigns or of any junior lien-holder or
guarantors, without liability on such Secured Party's part and notwithstanding
the Mortgagor's breach of any covenant or agreement of the Mortgagor in this
Instrument, extend the time for payment of the Secured Obligations or any part
thereof held by such Secured Party, reduce the payments thereon, release anyone
liable on any part of the Secured Obligations held by such Secured Party, accept
a renewal note or notes therefor, and modify the terms and time of payment of
the Secured Obligations held by such Secured Party. From time to time, subject
to the provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement, the Mortgagee may release
from the lien of this Instrument any part of the Mortgaged Property, take or
release other or additional security held by it, re-convey any part of the
Mortgaged Property, consent to any map or plan of the Property, consent to the
granting of any easement, join in any extension or subordination agreement,
and/or agree in writing with any of the other Secured Parties to modify the
terms of any other Secured Debt Document held by the Mortgagee. Any actions
taken by any Secured Party or the Mortgagee pursuant to the terms of this
paragraph 7 shall not affect the obligation of the Mortgagor or the Mortgagor's
successors or assigns to pay and perform the Secured Obligations and to observe
the covenants of the Mortgagor contained herein, and shall not affect the lien
or priority of lien hereof on the Mortgaged Property. The Mortgagor shall pay
the Mortgagee all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Mortgagee, including,
without limitation, such title insurance premiums and attorneys' fees as may be
incurred at the Mortgagee's option, for any such action if taken at the
Mortgagor's request.

      8. FORBEARANCE BY THE MORTGAGEE NOT A WAIVER. Any forbearance by the
Mortgagee in exercising any right or remedy hereunder or otherwise afforded by
applicable law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right
or remedy. The acceptance by the Mortgagee or any Secured Party of payment of
any sum secured by this Instrument after the due date of such payment shall not
be a waiver of the Mortgagee's or such Secured Party's right to either require
prompt payment when due of all other sums so secured or to declare a default for
failure to make prompt payment. The procurement of insurance or the payment of
taxes or other liens or charges by the Mortgagee shall not be a waiver of the
Mortgagee's right to exercise its remedies hereunder, nor shall the Mortgagee's
receipt of any awards, proceeds or damages pursuant to the provisions of the
Collateral Trust Agreement operate to cure or waive the Mortgagor's default in
payment of the Secured Obligations.

      9. UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE SECURITY AGREEMENT. This Instrument is intended
to be a security agreement pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code for any of
the items specified above as part of the Mortgaged Property which, under
applicable law, may be subject to a security interest pursuant to the Uniform
Commercial Code, and the Mortgagor hereby grants the Mortgagee a security
interest in said items. The Mortgagor agrees that the Mortgagee may file this
Instrument or a reproduction thereof, in the real estate records or other
appropriate index, as a financing statement for any of the items specified above
as part of the Mortgaged Property. Any reproduction of this Instrument or of any
other security agreement or financing statement shall be sufficient as a
financing statement. In addition, the Mortgagor agrees to execute and deliver to
the Mortgagee, upon the

                                      B-7
<PAGE>

Mortgagee's request, made at the direction of an Act of Secured Debtholders, any
financing statements, as well as extensions, renewals and amendments thereof,
and reproductions of this Instrument in such form as the Mortgagee may require
to perfect a security interest with respect to said items. Further, the
Mortgagor authorizes the Mortgagee to file Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements in Indiana County, Pennsylvania and such other jurisdictions as the
Mortgagee may require in order to perfect and provide notice of the liens and
security interest created hereunder. The Mortgagor shall pay all costs of filing
such financing statements and any extensions, renewals, amendments and releases
thereof, and shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of any record searches
for financing statements the Mortgagee may, acting upon an Act of Secured
Debtholders, reasonably require. Except for Permitted Encumbrances and except to
the extent the same does not violate the terms of any one of the other Secured
Debt Documents, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee, the
Mortgagor shall not create or suffer to be created pursuant to the Uniform
Commercial Code any other security interest in said items, including
replacements and additions thereto. Upon the occurrence and during the pendancy
of an Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall have the remedies of a secured party
under the Uniform Commercial Code and, acting upon an Act of Secured
Debtholders, may also invoke such remedies under the Uniform Commercial Code and
the remedies provided in paragraph 19 of this Instrument as to such items. In
exercising any of said remedies, the Mortgagee may proceed against the items of
real property and any items of personal property specified above as part of the
Mortgaged Property separately or together and in any order whatsoever, without
in any way affecting the availability of the Mortgagee's remedies under the
Uniform Commercial Code or of the remedies provided in paragraph 19 of this
Instrument.

      10. LEASES OF THE PROPERTY. Upon assignment by the Mortgagor to the
Mortgagee of any Leases or subleases of the Property, the Mortgagee shall have,
subject to the License (as defined below), all of the rights and powers
possessed by the Mortgagor prior to such assignment and the right to modify,
extend or terminate any and all existing Leases and subleases and to execute new
Leases and subleases, in the Mortgagee's sole discretion.

      11. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Each remedy provided in this Instrument is
distinct and cumulative to all other rights or remedies under this Instrument or
afforded by law or equity, and may be exercised concurrently, independently, or
successively, in any order whatsoever.

      12. TRANSFERS OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY OR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN
MORTGAGOR. Except to the extent the same does not violate the terms of any one
of the other Secured Debt Documents, neither the Mortgagor nor any constituent
thereof shall sell, transfer, lease or encumber (a) all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property, or any interest therein, (b) all or substantially all of the
assets of the Mortgagor, or (c) all or any part of the beneficial interests in
the Mortgagor (if the Mortgagor is not a natural person or persons but is a
corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company or other legal
entity).

      13. NOTICES. Except for any notice required under applicable law to be
given in another manner, (a) any notice to the Mortgagor provided for in this
Instrument shall be given in the manner and to the address specified in the
Collateral Trust Agreement or at such other address as the Mortgagor may
designate by notice to the Mortgagee as specified in the Collateral Trust
Agreement, and (b) any notice to the Mortgagee shall be given in the manner and
to the address specified in the Collateral Trust Agreement or to such other
address as the Mortgagee may designate by notice to the Mortgagor as specified
in the Collateral Trust Agreement. Any notice provided for in this Instrument
shall be deemed to have been given to the Mortgagor or the Mortgagee as
specified in the Collateral Trust Agreement.

      14. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS BOUND; JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; AGENTS;
CAPTIONS. The covenants and agreements herein contained shall bind, and the
rights hereunder shall inure to, the respective successors and assigns of the
Mortgagee and the Mortgagor. If the

                                      B-8
<PAGE>

Mortgagor is comprised of more than one entity or person, all covenants and
agreements of the Mortgagor shall be joint and several. In exercising any rights
hereunder or taking any actions provided for herein, the Mortgagee may act
through its employees, agents or independent contractors as authorized by the
Mortgagee. The captions and headings of the paragraphs of this Instrument are
for convenience only and are not to be used to interpret or define the
provisions hereof.

      15. GOVERNING LAW; SEVERABILITY. This Instrument shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflict of laws principles
of the State of New York), except that with respect to the exercise of remedies
hereunder and the creation, perfection and enforcement of the lien created by
this Instrument, the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located
shall govern, without regard to the conflict of laws principles of such
jurisdiction. In the event that any provision of this Instrument conflicts with
applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this
Instrument which can be given effect without the conflicting provisions, and to
this end the provisions of this Instrument are declared to be severable.

      16. WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. The Mortgagor hereby waives the
right to assert any statute of limitations as a bar to the enforcement of the
lien of this Instrument or any other Secured Debt Document or to any action
brought to enforce the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations.

      17. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING. Notwithstanding the existence of any other
security interest in the Mortgaged Property held by the Mortgagee or by any
other party, the Mortgagee, acting upon an Act of Secured Debtholders, shall
have the right to determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged
Property shall be subjected to the remedies provided herein. The Mortgagor, any
party who consents to this Instrument and any party who now or hereafter
acquires a security interest in the Mortgaged Property and who has actual or
constructive notice hereof hereby waives any and all right to require the
marshalling of assets in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies
permitted by applicable law or provided herein.

      18. ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS; APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER; MORTGAGEE IN POSSESSION.
As part of the consideration to induce the Secured Parties and the Mortgagee to
enter into the Collateral Trust Agreement, the Mortgagor hereby absolutely and
unconditionally assigns and transfers to the Mortgagee all of the Mortgagor's
right, title and interest in all rents of the Property, including those now due,
past due, or to become due by virtue of any Lease, regardless of to whom such
rents are payable. The Mortgagor hereby authorizes the Mortgagee or the
Mortgagee's agents to collect the aforesaid rents and hereby directs each tenant
and subtenant of the Property to pay such rents to the Mortgagee or the
Mortgagee's agents; provided, however, that prior to an Actionable Default, the
Mortgagor shall have the right to collect and receive all rents of the Property
in trust for the benefit of the Mortgagee and the Mortgagor, and, so long as no
Actionable Default has occurred, apply such rents for the account of the
Mortgagor to the extent doing so does not violate the terms of any one of the
other Secured Debt Documents (collectively, the "License"), it being intended by
the Mortgagor and the Mortgagee that this assignment of rents constitutes an
absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. Upon an
Actionable Default, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and without the
necessity of the Mortgagee entering upon and taking and maintaining full control
of the Property in person, by agent or by a court-appointed receiver, the
Mortgagee, acting upon an Act of Secured Debtholders, shall immediately be
entitled to possession of all of the Mortgagor's rents of the Property as
specified in this paragraph 18 as the same become due and payable, including,
but not limited to, rents then due and unpaid, and all such rents shall
immediately upon delivery of such notice be held by the Mortgagor in trust for
the benefit of the Mortgagee only; provided, however, that the written notice by
the Mortgagee to the Mortgagor of such Actionable Default shall contain a
statement that the Mortgagee exercises its rights to such rents. The Mortgagor
agrees that commencing upon delivery of such written

                                      B-9
<PAGE>

notice of such Actionable Default by the Mortgagee to the Mortgagor, each tenant
and subtenant of the Property shall make such rents payable to and pay such
rents to the Mortgagee or the Mortgagee's agents on the Mortgagee's written
demand to each tenant and subtenant therefor, delivered to each tenant and
subtenant personally or by mail without any liability on the part of said tenant
or subtenant to inquire further as to the existence of a default.

      The Mortgagor hereby covenants that the Mortgagor has not executed any
prior assignment of said rents, that the Mortgagor has not performed, and will
not perform, any acts or has not executed, and will not execute, any instrument
which would prevent the Mortgagee from exercising its rights under this
paragraph 18. The Mortgagee agrees that the foregoing shall not restrict the
Mortgagor from amending, terminating or releasing any such Lease to the extent
doing so does not violate the terms of any one of the other Secured Debt
Documents. The Mortgagor further covenants that the Mortgagor will execute and
deliver to the Mortgagee such further assignments of rents and revenues of the
Property as the Mortgagee may from time to time request.

      Upon an Actionable Default, the Mortgagee, acting upon an Act of Secured
Debtholders, shall be entitled to require the appointment of a receiver for the
Property, without notice to the Mortgagor or any other person or entity and the
Mortgagee may in person, by agent or by a court-appointed receiver, regardless
of the adequacy of the Mortgagee's security, enter upon and take and maintain
full control of the Property in order to perform all acts necessary and
appropriate for the operation and maintenance thereof including, but not limited
to, the execution, cancellation or modification of Leases and subleases, the
collection of all rents and revenues of the Property, the enforcement or
fulfillment of any terms, condition or provision of any Lease or sublease, the
making of repairs to the Property and the execution or termination of contracts
providing for the management or maintenance of the Property, all on such terms
as are deemed best by the Mortgagee to protect the security of this Instrument.
In the event the Mortgagee, acting upon an Act of Secured Debtholders, elects to
seek the appointment of a receiver for the Property upon an Actionable Default,
the Mortgagor hereby expressly consents to the appointment of such receiver. The
Mortgagee or the receiver shall be entitled to receive a reasonable fee for so
managing the Property.

      All rents collected subsequent to delivery of written notice by the
Mortgagee to the Mortgagor of the occurrence of an Actionable Default shall be
applied first to the costs, if any, of taking control of and managing the
Property and collecting the rents, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees, receiver's fees, premiums on receiver's bonds, costs of repairs
to the Property, premiums on insurance policies, taxes, assessments and other
charges on the Property, and the costs of discharging any obligation or
liability of the Mortgagor as lessor or landlord of the Property and then in
accordance with the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement. The Mortgagee or
the receiver shall have access to the books and records used in the operation
and maintenance of the Property and shall be liable to account only for those
rents actually received. The Mortgagee shall not be liable to the Mortgagor,
anyone claiming under or through the Mortgagor or anyone having an interest in
the Property by reason of anything done or left undone by the Mortgagee under
this paragraph 18.

      If the rents of the Property are not sufficient to meet the costs, if any,
of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the rents, any
funds expended by the Mortgagee for such purposes shall become indebtedness of
the Mortgagor to the Mortgagee secured by this Instrument pursuant to paragraph
5 hereof. Unless the Mortgagee and the Mortgagor agree in writing to other terms
of payment, such amounts shall be payable upon notice from the Mortgagee to the
Mortgagor requesting payment thereof and shall bear interest from the date of
disbursement until the date of actual payment of such amounts, at the Default
Rate.

                                      B-10
<PAGE>

      Any entering upon and taking and maintaining of control of the Property by
the Mortgagee or the receiver and any application of rents as provided herein
shall not cure or waive any default hereunder or invalidate any other right or
remedy of the Mortgagee under applicable law or provided herein. This assignment
of rents of the Property shall terminate as provided in the Collateral Trust
Agreement.

      19. DEFAULT; REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of an Actionable Default, the
Mortgagee may, acting upon an Act of Secured Debtholders, foreclose this
Instrument by judicial proceeding, and may invoke the power of sale and any
other remedies permitted by applicable law or provided herein. Supplementing the
definition of an Actionable Default, if the Mortgagor shall at any time deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Mortgagee without prior written consent of the
Mortgagee a notice pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. Section. 8143 electing to limit the
indebtedness secured by this Instrument, same shall be deemed to constitute an
Actionable Default. The Mortgagor acknowledges that, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon the occurrence of an Actionable Default, the Mortgagee
without prior judicial hearing may, acting upon an Act of Secured Debtholders,
exercise the power of sale herein granted. The Mortgagor has the right to bring
an action to assert the non-existence of a breach or any other defense of the
Mortgagor to such sale. The Mortgagee shall be entitled to collect all costs and
expenses incurred in pursuing such remedies, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of documentary evidence, abstracts and
title reports.

      If the Property is sold pursuant to paragraph 23 of this Instrument, the
Mortgagor or any person holding possession of the Property through the Mortgagor
shall immediately surrender possession of the Property to the purchaser at such
sale upon the purchaser's written demand. If possession is not surrendered upon
the purchaser's written demand, the Mortgagor or such person shall be a tenant
at sufferance and may be removed by writ of possession or by an action for
forcible entry and detainer.

      20. ATTORNEYS' FEES. As used in this Instrument, "attorneys' fees" shall
include attorneys' fees, if any, which may be awarded by an appellate court and
attorneys' fees incurred in connection with any bankruptcy proceedings relating
to or otherwise involving the Borrower or the Mortgagor or any of their
constituent entities.

      21. FUTURE ADVANCES.

            (a) This Instrument is given to secure not only the existing
indebtedness secured hereby but also future advances as are made under the
Secured Debt Documents up to a total maximum principal amount of
$600,000,000.00, plus interest thereon, and any disbursements made under this
Instrument or the other Secured Debt Documents by the Mortgagee for the payment
of taxes, insurance or other liens on the Mortgaged Property encumbered by this
Instrument, with interest on such disbursements, which advances shall be secured
hereby to the same extent as if such future advances were made on this date. The
total amount of indebtedness secured hereby may increase or decrease from time
to time. The provisions of this paragraph 21 shall not be construed to imply any
obligation on any of the Secured Parties to make any future advances, it being
the intention of the parties that any future advances shall be solely at the
discretion and option of the relevant Secured Parties.

            (b) This instrument shall, from time to time, be supplemented or
amended by the Mortgagee and the Mortgagor to further evidence that a specific
future Series of Secured Debt is included within the Secured Obligations and
secured by this Instrument. Such supplements or amendments shall be in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C or in such other form as the Mortgagee and the
Mortgagor may from time to time agree.

      22. MORTGAGOR'S MISCELLANEOUS COVENANTS. The Mortgagor hereby covenants,
agrees and undertakes to:

                                      B-11
<PAGE>

            (a) except for Permitted Encumbrances and except to the extent doing
so does not violate the terms of any one of the other Secured Debt Documents,
not execute or deliver any deed of trust, mortgage or pledge of any type
covering all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property;

            (b) except for Permitted Encumbrances and except to the extent doing
so does not violate the terms of any one of the other Secured Debt Documents,
not permit any drilling or exploration for or extraction, removal or production
of any mineral, natural element, compound or substance from the surface or
subsurface of the Property regardless of the depth thereof or the method of
mining or extraction thereof;

            (c) without providing notice to the Mortgagee, not change its name
or organizational identification number if it has one; and

            (d) pay on demand all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses and
other expenditures, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses paid or incurred by the Mortgagee to enforce or incident to the
enforcement of this Instrument or the exercise of any right or remedy of the
Mortgagee hereunder.

      23. FORECLOSURE; MORTGAGEE IN POSSESSION; INDEMNIFICATION. At any time
after the occurrence of an Actionable Default, the Mortgagee may, acting upon an
Act of Secured Debtholders, either with or without entry or taking possession as
herein provided, proceed by suit or suits at law or in equity or by any other
appropriate proceeding or remedy to foreclose the lien hereof for the Secured
Obligations or any part thereof and to sell the Mortgaged Property as an
entirety or otherwise, as the Mortgagee may determine. In any civil action to
foreclose the lien hereof or otherwise enforce the Mortgagee's rights, there
shall be allowed and included as additional indebtedness secured hereby in the
order or judgment for foreclosure and sale or other order all reasonable
expenditures and expenses which may be paid or incurred by or on behalf of the
Mortgagee for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, appraisers' fees, engineers'
fees, outlays for documentary and expert evidence, stenographers' charges,
publication costs, and costs (which may be estimates as to items to be expended
after entry of said order or judgment) of procuring all such abstracts of title,
title searches and examination, title insurance policies, and similar data and
assurances with respect to the title as the Mortgagee may deem reasonably
necessary either to prosecute such civil action or to evidence to bidders at any
sale which may be had pursuant to such order or judgment the true condition of
the title to, or the value of, the Mortgaged Property. All expenditures and
expenses of the nature in this paragraph 23 mentioned and such costs, expenses
and fees as may be incurred in the protection of the Mortgaged Property and the
maintenance of the lien of this Instrument, including the reasonable fees, and
actual costs and expenses of any attorneys employed by the Mortgagee in any
litigation or proceeding affecting this Instrument or any other Secured Debt
Document or the Mortgaged Property, including probate, appellate and bankruptcy
proceedings, or in preparation for the commencement or defense of any action or
proceeding or threatened action or proceeding, shall be immediately due and
payable to the Mortgagee, with interest thereon at the Default Rate, and shall
be secured by this Instrument. The failure to join any tenant or tenants of the
Property as party defendant or defendants in any such civil action or the
failure of any such order or judgment to foreclose their rights shall not be
asserted by the Mortgagor as a defense in any civil action instituted to collect
the Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, or any deficiency remaining unpaid
after foreclosure and sale of the Mortgaged Property, any statute or rule of law
at any time existing to the contrary notwithstanding. Upon any foreclosure sale,
the Mortgagee may bid for and purchase the Mortgaged Property and shall be
entitled to apply all or any part of the Secured Obligations as a credit to the
purchase price. The proceeds of any foreclosure sale of the Mortgaged Property
shall be distributed and applied, at the Mortgagee's option, to reduce the
amount of the Secured Obligations in such priority and in such proportions as
the Mortgagee in its sole discretion shall deem proper.

                                      B-12
<PAGE>

      24. TRANSFER OF LIEN. The Mortgagee may, at any time, transfer or assign
this Instrument and any other Secured Debt Document held by it as permitted
pursuant to the provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement. The Mortgagee may
forward to each purchaser, transferee, or assignee all documents and information
which the Mortgagee now has or may hereafter acquire relating to the
transactions contemplated by the Collateral Trust Agreement and to the Mortgagor
and/or the Mortgaged Property, whether furnished by the Mortgagor or otherwise,
as the Mortgagee determines necessary or desirable. The Mortgagor shall furnish
and the Mortgagor consents to the Mortgagee furnishing to such purchaser,
transferee or assignee any and all information concerning the Mortgaged Property
and the Leases, as may be requested by the Mortgagee, purchaser, transferee or
assignee in connection with any sale or transfer.

      25. CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT

      THE FOLLOWING SECTION SETS FORTH WARRANTS OF ATTORNEY FOR ANY ATTORNEY TO
CONFESS JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE MORTGAGOR. IN GRANTING THESE WARRANTS OF ATTORNEY
TO CONFESS JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE MORTGAGOR, THE MORTGAGOR HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
INTENTIONALLY, VOLUNTARILY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS THE MORTGAGOR MAY HAVE TO PRIOR NOTICE AND
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING UNDER THE RESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS AND LAWS OF THE
COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WITHOUT
LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
MORTGAGOR HEREBY SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS THE MORTGAGOR HAS OR MAY HAVE TO
NOTICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING PRIOR TO EXECUTION UPON ANY JUDGMENT
ENTERED AGAINST THE MORTGAGOR PURSUANT TO THE TERMS HEREOF.

      FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING POSSESSION OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY, OR ANY
PORTION(S) THEREOF, AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY ACTIONABLE DEFAULT, ACTING UPON
AN ACT OF SECURED DEBTHOLDERS, THE MORTGAGOR HEREBY AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS ANY
ATTORNEY OF ANY COURT OF RECORD IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA OR
ELSEWHERE, AS ATTORNEY FOR THE MORTGAGOR AND ALL PERSONS CLAIMING UNDER OR
THROUGH THE MORTGAGOR, BY COMPLAINT OR OTHERWISE, TO APPEAR FOR AND ENTER AND
CONFESS JUDGMENT AGAINST THE MORTGAGOR, AND AGAINST ALL PERSONS CLAMING UNDER OR
THROUGH THE MORTGAGOR, IN FAVOR OR THE MORTGAGEE, FOR RECOVERY BY THE MORTGAGEE
OF POSSESSION OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY, OR ANY PORTION(S) THEREOF, FOR WHICH
THIS INSTRUMENT, OR A COPY THEREOF VERIFIED BY AFFIDAVIT, SHALL BE A SUFFICIENT
WARRANT; AND THEREUPON A WRIT OF POSSESSION (OR LIKE WRIT UNDER THEN APPLICABLE
LAW) MAY IMMEDIATELY ISSUE FOR POSSESSION OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY, OR SUCH
PORTION(S) THEREOF, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WRIT OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER AND WITHOUT
ANY STAY OF EXECUTION. IF FOR ANY REASON AFTER SUCH ACTION HAS BEEN COMMENCED IT
SHALL BE DISCONTINUED, OR POSSESSION OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY OR SUCH
PORTION(S) THEREOF SHALL REMAIN IN OR BE RESTORED TO THE MORTGAGOR, THE
MORTGAGEE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT FOR THE SAME ACTIONABLE DEFAULT OR ANY SUBSEQUENT
ACTIONABLE DEFAULT, ACTING UPON AN ACT OF SECURED DEBTHOLDERS, TO BRING ONE OR
MORE FURTHER ACTIONS OR ENTER AND CONFESS JUDGMENT ONE OR MORE TIMES AS ABOVE
PROVIDED TO

                                      B-13
<PAGE>

RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY, OR ANY PORTION(S) THEREOF. UPON
ANY ACTIONABLE DEFAULT AND ACTING UPON AN ACT OF SECURED DEBTHOLDERS, THE
MORTGAGEE MAY BRING AN ACTION IN EJECTMENT AND CONFESS JUDGMENT THEREIN BEFORE
OR AFTER THE INSTITUTION OF PROCEEDINGS TO FORECLOSE THIS INSTRUMENT OR TO
ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURED DEBT DOCUMENTS, OR AFTER ENTRY OF JUDGMENT
THEREIN OR ON ANY SECURED DEBT DOCUMENT, OR AFTER A SHERIFF'S SALE OR JUDICIAL
SALE OR OTHER FORECLOSURE SALE OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY, OR ANY PORTION(S)
THEREOF, IN WHICH THE MORTGAGEE IS THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER, IT BEING THE
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES THAT THE AUTHORIZATION TO PURSUE SUCH PROCEEDINGS
FOR OBTAINING POSSESSION AND CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT THEREIN IS AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THE REMEDIES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS INSTRUMENT AND OTHER SECURED DEBT
DOCUMENTS, AND SHALL SURVIVE ANY EXECUTION SALE TO THE MORTGAGEE.

      THE MORTGAGOR (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
THE MORTGAGEE HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO EXERCISE OR ENFORCE THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS CONCERNING CONFESSION OF
JUDGMENTS AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE ENTERING INTO BY THE MORTGAGEE OF THE
OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN INDUCED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE INCLUSION HEREIN OF SAID PROVISIONS. THE MORTGAGOR FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

            (a) The proceeds of the advances have been and shall be disbursed,
advanced, and repaid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Secured
Debt Documents. Without limiting anything contained in any provision hereof,
this Instrument is an Open-End Mortgage which secures the Mortgagor's obligation
to repay all advances of principal made prior to, at or after closing up to the
principal amount of the Secured Obligations up to the maximum amount of
$600,000,000.00, and all interest, late charges, fees and other amounts due
under this Instrument and the other Secured Debt Documents and, in addition
thereto, (i) all advances by the Mortgagee or any Secured Party to the Mortgagor
or any other person to pay costs of erection, construction, alteration, repair,
restoration and completion of any part of the Improvements or any other
Mortgaged Property, (ii) any and all advances made or costs incurred by the
Mortgagee or any Secured Party for the payment of taxes, assessments,
maintenance charges, insurance premiums, and inspections or audits of the
Mortgaged Property, (iii) any and all costs incurred for the protection of all
or any part of the Mortgaged Property or the lien of this Instrument, and (iv)
any and all legal fees, costs and other expenses incurred by the Mortgagee by
reason of any Actionable Default, Actionable Default Period or otherwise in
connection with the Secured Obligations. All such advances shall be entitled to
the lien priority and all the benefits provided under 42

<PAGE>

Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. Section 8143 et seq. (1990) (the "Open-End Mortgage
Statute"). Without limiting the generality of any other provisions hereof, this
Instrument shall be entitled to the lien priority and all of the benefits of an
"Open-End Mortgage" under the Open-End Mortgage Statute.

            (b) If the Mortgagee receives written notice which may constitute or
purports to constitute a notice pursuant to Section 8143(b) of the Open-End
Mortgage Statute from a holder of a lien or encumbrance on the Mortgaged
Property which is subordinate to the lien of the Instrument, then, and
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any of the Secured
Debt Documents, the Mortgagor agrees that the Secured Parties shall not be
responsible to make any further advances to the Mortgagor (and the Secured
Parties are released from all liability, if any, for failure to make such
advances) if the Secured Parties determine in their sole discretion that any
such advance requested by the Mortgagor could be construed to be an unobligated
advance under Section 8143(b) of the Open-End Mortgage Statute.

            (c) If the Mortgagor should at any time elect to limit the
liabilities secured by this Instrument pursuant to Section 8143(c) of the
Open-End Mortgage Statute, the Mortgagor agrees that notice of such election
shall (i) not be effective unless and until it is served upon the Mortgagee in
accordance with the requirements of Section 8143(d) of the Open-End Mortgage
Statute and fully complies with the requirements for the giving of notices under
the Secured Debt Documents; (ii) release the Secured Parties from all
obligation, if any, to make any further advances under the Secured Debt
Documents notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in such notice or
the Secured Debt Documents; (iii) constitute, at the election of the Secured
Parties, a Credit Agreement Event of Default; and (iv) not be effective to limit
the Mortgagor's liability for payment and performance of all liabilities for
which the Mortgagor is responsible under this Instrument or the other Secured
Debt Documents (including, without limitation, all reimbursement and
indemnification agreements) whether such liabilities arise prior or subsequent
to the date of such notice. Any advances made by the Mortgagee thereafter shall
continue to be secured by this Instrument.

      27. DUPLICATE ORIGINALS. This Instrument may be executed in any number of
duplicate originals and each duplicate original shall be deemed to be an
original.

      28. RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Instrument, the rights of the Mortgagee under this Instrument
and each other Secured Debt Document held by the Mortgagee are subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the Collateral Trust Agreement,
reference to which is made for all purposes; provided, however, that any
forbearance by the Mortgagee in exercising any right or remedy available to the
Mortgagee under the Collateral Trust Agreement shall not give rise to a defense
on the part of the Mortgagor with respect to the Mortgagee's exercise of any
right or remedy pursuant to this Instrument or as otherwise afforded by
applicable law.

      PROVIDED ALWAYS, that this Instrument will cease, terminate and thereafter
be of no further force and effect upon payment of the Secured Obligations, and
upon such occurrence Mortgagee shall promptly satisfy this Instrument of record
in accordance with the Collateral Trust Agreement.
