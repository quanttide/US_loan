      The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters, in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 2720 ("Rule 2720") of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") and subject to the terms and conditions

      Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings

      The Company and the Guarantors have agreed to secure the Securities and
the Guarantees "equally and ratably" (as defined in the "Description of Notes"

(subject to Permitted Prior Liens) granted to the Collateral Trustee
for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Obligations, in all of the Shared
Collateral.

      1.    The Company, with respect to itself and the Guarantors, and each of
the Guarantors, solely with respect to itself, represent and warrant to, and
agree with, each of the Underwriters and the Independent Underwriter that:

            (a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File
      No. 333-107296) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"),
      which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the
      Securities. The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under
      the Act. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
      statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings for that
      purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the
      Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part
      of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. The
      Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under
      the Act a supplement or supplements to the form of prospectus included in
      such registration statement relating to the Securities and the plan of
      distribution thereof. Such registration statement, including the exhibits
      thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called
      the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus in the form in which it
      appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Base
      Prospectus"; and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in
      which it shall first be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424
      (including the Base Prospectus as so supplemented), is hereinafter called
      the "Final Prospectus." Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus,
      which has heretofore been filed pursuant to Rule 424, is hereinafter
      called the "Preliminary Prospectus." Any reference herein to the
      Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or
      the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents
      incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which
      were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
      "Exchange Act"), on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue
      date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final
      Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms
      "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration
      Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final
      Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any
      document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the
      issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final
      Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by
      reference; each Preliminary Prospectus and the prospectuses filed as part
      of the Registration Statement as originally filed or as part of any
      amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, complied
      when so filed in all material respects with the Act and the rules
      thereunder;

            (b) As of the date hereof, when the Final Prospectus is first filed
      or transmitted for filing pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, when, prior
      to the Time of Delivery (as hereinafter defined), any amendment to the
      Registration Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any
      document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), when
      any supplement to the Final Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at
      the Time of Delivery, (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any
      such time, and, in the case of Securities issued pursuant to Indentures,
      such Indentures, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
      requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules
      thereunder and (ii) neither the Registration Statement, as amended as of
      any such time, nor the Final

                                       2
<PAGE>

      Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, will contain
      any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
      therein not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no
      representations and warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration
      Statement that constitutes the trustee's Statement of Eligibility and
      Qualification (the "Form T-1s") under the Trust Indenture Act, as amended
      (the "Trust Indenture Act"), or (ii) the information contained in or
      omitted from the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or any
      amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity
      with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter
      through the Representatives or by the Independent Underwriter expressly
      for use in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus;

            (c) Each document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
      reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, when
      they became effective or at the time they were or hereafter are filed with
      the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the
      Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and, when read together with the
      other information in the Final Prospectus, at the time the Registration
      Statement became effective, at the time the Final Prospectus was issued
      and at the Time of Delivery did not and will not contain an untrue
      statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
      be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
      provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply
      to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity
      with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter
      through the Representatives or by the Independent Underwriter expressly
      for use therein;

            (d) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, taken as a

      respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration
      Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus, otherwise than as described or
      contemplated in the Final Prospectus, there has not been any change in the
      capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
      or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective
      material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management,
      financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
      Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

            (e) The Company and its subsidiaries have good and indefeasible
      title in fee simple to all real property and good and indefeasible title
      to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and clear of all

      Prospectus or such as do not materially affect the value of such property
      and do not interfere with the use made of such property by the Company and
      its subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease by
      the Company and its subsidiaries are held by them under enforceable leases
      with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere with the use
      made of such property and buildings by the Company and its subsidiaries;

            (f) Each of the Company and the Guarantors has been duly
      incorporated or formed, as the case may be, and is validly existing as a
      corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, as the case

      each been duly authorized by each of the Company and the Guarantors and

            (y) The Collateral Trust Agreement, dated July 1, 2003, grants and
      creates a collateral trust (the "Collateral Trust") for the benefit of the
      holders of the Securities and the other present and future holders of

      July 1, 2003, among the Collateral Trustee and the grantors parties
      thereto, as amended as of December 22, 2004 (the "Security Agreement") is
      effective to grant and create, (i) in favor of the Collateral Trustee, for
      the benefit of each present and future holder of Obligations under the
      Credit Agreement, a valid and enforceable security interest in the
      Separate Collateral described therein and proceeds and products thereof;
      and such security interests are perfected security interests (subject to
      Permitted Prior Liens), and (ii) in favor of the Collateral Trustee, for
      the benefit of the holders of the Securities and each other present and
      future holder of Secured Obligations (collectively, the "Secured
      Parties"), a valid and enforceable security interest in the Shared
      Collateral described therein and proceeds and products thereof; and such
      security interests are perfected security interests (subject to Permitted
      Prior Liens). Upon delivery of the Notice of Additional Secured Debt

Securities, plus accrued interest, if any, from December 22, 2004 to the Time of
Delivery hereunder, the principal amount of Securities (and the Guarantees
thereof) set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto.

<PAGE>

                  (ii) The Independent Underwriter has participated in the
            preparation of the Final Prospectus and has exercised the usual

            responsibilities and liabilities of an underwriter under the Act
            specifically including those inherent in Section 11 thereof;

                  (iv) Based upon (A) a review of the Company, including an
            examination of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus,

            comparable companies similar to the Securities, and (D) such other
            studies, analyses and investigations as the Independent Underwriter
            has deemed appropriate, and assuming that the offering and sale of
            the Securities is made as contemplated herein and in the Preliminary
            Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, the Independent Underwriter
            recommends, as of the date of the execution and delivery of this
            Agreement, that the yield on the Securities be not less than 6.75%
            (corresponding to an initial public offering price of 100.0% of the
            Securities), which minimum yield should in no way be considered or
            relied upon as an indication of the value of the Securities; and

                  (v) Subject to the provisions of Section 8 hereof, the

      Final Prospectus as so amended or supplemented that are substantially the
      same as those services being rendered with respect to the offering and
      sale of the Securities as described in the Final Prospectus (including
      those described in subsection (b) above).

            (d) The Company, the Guarantors the Underwriters and the Independent

      the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as
      long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities
      and the Guarantees, provided that in connection therewith neither the
      Company nor any of the Guarantors shall be required to qualify as a

      results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
      whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus
      as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case
      described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives
      so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to
      proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the
      terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectus as amended or
      supplemented;

            (h) On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have
      occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any
      "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is
      defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act,
      and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has
      under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its
      rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

            (i) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of
      the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in
      securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"); (ii) a
      suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities
      on the NYSE; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities
      declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material
      disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance
      services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of
      hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United
      States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other
      calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic
      conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such
      event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the
      Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the
      public offering or the delivery of the Securities

                                       14

      on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectus as
      amended or supplemented;

            (j) The Company shall have complied with any request by the
      Representatives or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be, with
      respect to the furnishing of the Final Prospectus in compliance with the
      provisions of Section 6(c);

            (k) The Collateral Trustee shall have received (with a copy for the
      Underwriters and the Independent Underwriter) at the Time of Delivery:

                  (ii) appropriately completed copies, which have been duly
            authorized for filing by the appropriate Person, of Uniform

            name changes or merger of the Company or any Guarantor and/or (b)
            reflect the Collateral subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, or
            other similar instruments or documents to be filed under the UCC of
            all jurisdictions as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion
            of the Collateral Trustee and its counsel, desirable to perfect the
            security interests of the Collateral Trustee pursuant to the
            Security Documents;

            (under its present name and any relevant previous names) as the
            debtor (none of which shall cover any Collateral described in the
            Security Documents, other than such Financing Statements that
            evidence Permitted Liens);

                  (v) such releases, reconveyances, satisfactions or other
            instruments as it may request to confirm the release, satisfaction
            and discharge in full of all mortgages and deeds of trust at any
            time delivered by the Company or any Guarantor, except those

            accepted the supplements to the Mortgages for recording and will
            cause the supplements to the Mortgages to be duly filed and recorded
            within ten days following the Time of Delivery and have agreed to

            in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters,
            insuring each Mortgage to be a valid, enforceable and perfected Lien
            securing Secured

                                       15
<PAGE>

            Obligations upon all real property described therein, free from all
            prior Liens except Permitted Prior Liens, for the full amount stated
            in the existing title insurance policies;

                  (vii) a certificate of insurance reasonably satisfactory to
            the Underwriters confirming that all insurance requirements of the

            Underwriters, the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee may reasonably
            request in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of
            them.

            (l) An arrangement satisfactory to the Representatives shall have

      amendments or other similar Financing Statements and Uniform Commercial
      Code Form UCC-3 termination statements required pursuant to clause (k)(ii)
      and (iii) above (collectively, the "Financing Statements");

            (m) Each of the Company and the Guarantors shall have furnished or
      caused to be furnished to the Representatives and the Independent
      Underwriter at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the
      Company and the Guarantors satisfactory to the Representatives and the
      Independent Underwriter as to the accuracy of the representations and
      warranties of the Company and the Guarantors herein at and as of such Time
      of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of
      all of their obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such
      Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (g) and (h)
      of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives or the
      Independent Underwriter, as the case may be, may reasonably request;

            (n) The Company and each of the Guarantors shall have delivered
      executed copies of the Securities, the Guarantees, the Indentures and the
      Security Documents (with all Mortgages and any related assignments duly
      acknowledged in recordable form) to the Underwriters, in each case in form
      and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Underwriters;
      and

            (o) The Company and the Guarantors shall have consummated the Credit
      Agreement prior to, or simultaneously with, the Time of Delivery on
      substantially the same terms described in the Final Prospectus and the
      Underwriters shall have received executed counterparts of the Credit
      Agreement and such other documentation as they deem necessary to evidence
      the consummation thereof.

      9. The Independent Underwriter hereby consents to the references to it as
set forth under the caption "Underwriting" in the Final Prospectus and in any
amendment or supplement thereto made in accordance with Section 6(a) hereof.

      10. (a) Each of the Company and the Guarantors will, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and the Independent
Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which such Underwriter or the Independent Underwriter, as the case
may be, may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or
are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in (i) the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement
(when considered together with the document to which such amendment or
supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the
Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any other
prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement

                                       16
<PAGE>

(when considered together with the document to which such amendment or
supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
reimburse each Underwriter or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be,
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or the
Independent Underwriter, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided,
however, that neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall be liable in any such
case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement
or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any such amendment or
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives or the Independent
Underwriter expressly for use therein or constitutes a reference to the
Independent Underwriter consented to by it pursuant to Section 9 hereof.

            (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company
      and the Guarantors and the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be,
      against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company,
      any Guarantor or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be, may
      become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
      claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
      of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
      material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration
      Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any
      amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
      omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
      be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
      misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
      untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
      omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration
      Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any such
      amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
      information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the
      Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company
      and the Guarantors or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be, for
      any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the
      Guarantors or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be, in
      connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as
      such expenses are incurred.

            (c) The Independent Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the
      Company and the Guarantors and each Underwriter against any losses,
      claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, any Guarantor or such
      Underwriter, as the case may be, may become subject, under the Act or
      otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
      actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue
      statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
      Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus
      as amended or supplemented, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or
      arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
      therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
      order to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the
      extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged
      untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any
      Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus
      as amended or supplemented or any such amendment or supplement in reliance
      upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
      by the Independent Underwriter expressly

                                       17
<PAGE>

      for use therein or constitutes a reference to the Independent Underwriter
      consented to by it pursuant to Section 9 hereof; and will reimburse the
      Company and the Guarantors or each Underwriter, as the case may be, for
      any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the
      Guarantors or each Underwriter, as the case may be, in connection with
      investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are
      incurred.

            (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection
      (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such
      indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
      against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the
      indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the
      omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
      liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under
      such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any
      indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
      commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
      participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with
      any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
      thereof, with a single counsel (in addition to local counsel) satisfactory
      to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the
      indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after
      notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
      election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall
      not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any
      legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case
      subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the
      defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No
      indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified
      party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of
      any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in
      respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
      (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to
      such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)
      includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all
      liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a
      statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act,
      by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

            (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is
      unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
      subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages
      or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then
      each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
      such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
      liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is
      appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by each party to
      this Agreement from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the
      allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted
      by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice
      required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall
      contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in
      such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative
      benefits but also the relative fault of the each party to this Agreement
      in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
      losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as
      well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits
      received by the Company, the Guarantors, the Underwriters and the
      Independent Underwriter shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as
      the total net proceeds from the sale of the Securities (before deducting
      expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors in the offering, the
      total underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the Underwriters
      as set forth in the table on the cover

                                       18
<PAGE>

      of the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the fee payable to
      the Independent Underwriter pursuant to the first sentence of Section 4(e)
      hereof, respectively, bear to the sum of the total proceeds from the sale
      of the Securities (before deducting expenses) in the offering and the fee
      payable to the Independent Underwriter pursuant to the first sentence of
      Section 4(e) hereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference
      to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of
      a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material
      fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or
      either the Underwriters or the Independent Underwriter on the other and
      the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
      opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company,
      the Guarantors, the Underwriters and the Independent Underwriter agree
      that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
      subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
      Underwriters and the Independent Underwriter were treated as one entity
      for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take
      account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this
      subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a
      result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
      respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed
      to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
      indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
      action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no
      Underwriter nor the Independent Underwriter shall be required to
      contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at
      which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were
      offered to the public, and the Independent Underwriter shall not be
      required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
      total price at which the Securities underwritten by the Underwriters and
      distributed to the public were offered to the public, exceeds the amount
      of any damages which such Underwriter or the Independent Underwriter, as
      the case may be, has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
      untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
      person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
      Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
      person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
      Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several
      in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.

            (f) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this
      Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the
      Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
      conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or the
      Independent Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations
      of the Underwriters under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any
      liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall
      extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director
      of the Company or the Guarantors and to each person, if any, who controls
      the Company, the Guarantors or the Independent Underwriter within the
      meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Independent Underwriter
      under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the
      Independent Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
      terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the
      Guarantors and to each person, if any, who controls the Company, the
      Guarantors or any of the Underwriters within the meaning of the Act.

      11. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the
Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in
their discretion arrange for the Representatives or another party or other
parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained

                                       19
<PAGE>

herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter the
Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the
Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to
procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the
Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that,
within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company
that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company
notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such
Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone
the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to
effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration
Statement or the Final Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements,
and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration
Statement or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives
may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement
shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if
such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such
Securities.

            (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of
      the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
      Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
      aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased
      does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the
      Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each
      non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities
      which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to
      require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share
      (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed
      to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or
      Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing
      herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its
      default.

            (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of
      the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
      Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
      aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds
      one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or
      if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b)
      above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a
      defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall
      thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting
      Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the
      Company and the Underwriters as provided in the second sentence of Section
      4(e) hereof and Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution
      agreements in Section 10 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a
      defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

      12. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors, the several Underwriters
and the Independent Underwriter, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on
behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the
results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or on behalf of the
Independent Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the
Independent Underwriter or the Company, the Guarantors or any officer or
director or controlling person of the Company or a Guarantor, and shall survive
delivery of and payment for the Securities.

      13. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof,
the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter or the
Independent Underwriter except as provided

                                       20
<PAGE>

                                    EXHIBIT I

  OPINION OF SKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE, MEAGHER & FLOM LLP, COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

            1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing in
good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware.

            2. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors.

            3. Each Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Indentures are valid and
binding agreements of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors,
enforceable against the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors in
accordance with its terms.

            4. The execution and delivery by the Company and each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors of each of the Transaction Documents and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance
and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees, will not (i) constitute a
violation of, or a breach or default under, the terms of any Applicable Contract
or (ii) violate or conflict with, or result in any contravention of, any
Applicable Law or any Applicable Order. We do not express any opinion, however,
as to whether the execution, delivery or performance by the Company or any of
the Subsidiary Guarantors of each of the Transaction Documents will constitute a
violation of, or a default under, any covenant, restriction or provision with
respect to financial ratios or tests or any aspect of the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

            5. No Governmental Approval, which has not been obtained or taken
and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required in
connection with, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees or
the consummation by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

            6. The Securities have been duly executed by the Company, and when
issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with
the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities will constitute valid
and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the
Indentures and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.

            7. When the Securities are issued and delivered by the Company
against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting
Agreement, each Guarantee will constitute the valid and binding obligation of
each Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable against such Subsidiary Guarantor in
accordance with its terms.

            8. The statements in the Prospectus Supplement under the captions
(i) "Description of Notes," in so far as such statements purport to summarize
certain provisions of the Indentures and the Securities, (ii) "Underwriting" in
so far as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the
Underwriting Agreement and (iii) "United States Federal Tax Considerations for
Non-U.S. Holders," in so far as such statements purport to address the federal
income tax consequences to non-U.S. holders, in each case, fairly summarize such
provisions or consequences, as applicable, in all material respects.

            9. The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the
offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds as
described in the Final Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company," as such
term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                                   Exhibit I-1

<PAGE>

            10. Pursuant to Section 309 of the Trust Indenture Act, the
Indentures have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.(i)

            On the basis of the foregoing, (i) the Registration Statement, as of
the date of the filing of the Company's 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K and as
of December 14, 2004 and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus
Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face
to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of
the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do
not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other
financial information, included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded
therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Statement
of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1")), (ii) the Incorporated Documents,
as of their respective filing dates, appeared on their face to be appropriately
responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder (except that in each case we do
not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other
financial information, included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded
therefrom or the exhibits to any of the Incorporated Documents) and (iii) no
facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the
Registration Statement, as of the date of the filing of such Form 10-K and as of
December 14, 2004, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading or that the Base Prospectus, as
supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus
Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any
view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information,
included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the
exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).

(i)This option will be in Skadden's 10b-5 letter.

                                   Exhibit I-2

<PAGE>

                                   EXHIBIT II

          OPINION OF MICHAEL L. JINES, GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

            1. Each Reliant Party is a corporation, partnership or limited
liability company (as applicable) duly organized or formed, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The name of each
Reliant Party as shown on its organizational/charter document, as amended,
pursuant to which it was organized or formed, is correctly set forth on Exhibit
A to this opinion.

            2. Each Reliant Party that conducts business in the State of Texas,
as indicated with an asterisk on Exhibit A to this opinion, is duly qualified to
conduct business as a foreign corporation, limited partnership or limited
liability company, as the case may be, in the State of Texas. Each Reliant Party
is duly qualified to conduct business as a foreign corporation, limited
partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in each
jurisdiction identified on Exhibit B to this opinion.

            3. Each Reliant Party has all requisite power and authority to (a)
conduct its business as presently conducted, and (b) execute and deliver, and to
perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.
The execution, delivery and performance of each of the Transaction Documents
executed and delivered on the date hereof have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of each Reliant Party which is a party thereto, and
the Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf
of each such Reliant Party. In particular, the Secured Notes have been duly
authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by REI and the
Guarantees have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the
Secured Note Guarantors.

            4. The execution and delivery by each Reliant Party of each
Transaction Document to which it is a party, including the issuance and sale of
the Secured Notes and the Guarantees, and the performance by such Reliant Party
of its obligations thereunder, (i) do not violate its charter or by-laws, its
partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement, as the case may
be, or any other organizational document of such Reliant Party, or (ii) to the
best of my knowledge, violate any order, decree or judgment of any Delaware,
Texas, New York, or United States federal court or other agency of government
having jurisdiction over any of the Reliant Parties.

            5. Except as disclosed in the Final Prospectus (including the
documents incorporated by reference therein), to the best of my knowledge, (i)
there is no action, suit or proceeding pending or overtly threatened, at law or
in equity to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which
any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject, which if
determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
businesses, assets, operations or financial condition of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) there is no action, suit or proceeding
pending or, to the best of my knowledge, overtly threatened, at law or in
equity, before or by any state or federal court or any state or federal
governmental agency, body or official relating specifically to the transactions
under the Opinion Documents.

                                  Exhibit II-1

<PAGE>

            6. The execution, delivery and performance by each Reliant Party of
each Security Document to which it is a party has been duly authorized, and the
Security Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Reliant Parties.

            7. All of the issued shares of capital stock of each of the Reliant
Parties (other than REI) have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are
fully paid and non-assessable, and (except for the directors' qualifying shares,
the liens securing the Credit Agreement Debt and the Parity Secured Debt and as
otherwise set forth in the Final Prospectus) are owned directly or indirectly by
REI, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims.

            In the course of acting as General Counsel to the Company in
connection with its preparation of the Final Prospectus, I or attorneys under my
supervision participated in conferences and telephone conversations with
representatives of REI, representatives of REI's counsel, representatives of the
independent public accountants of REI, representatives of the Underwriters and
representatives of the Underwriters' counsel, during which conferences and
conversations the contents of the Final Prospectus and related matters were
discussed, and I or attorneys under my supervision reviewed certain corporate
records and documents. Based on this participation in such conferences and
conversations and review of such records and documents, I advise you that no
information has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the Final
Prospectus (except the financial statements and other financial and statistical
data included therein and the statements set forth under the headings
Underwriting, Legal Matters and Independent Auditors as to which I express no
view), as of its date and the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                                  Exhibit II-2

<PAGE>

                                   EXHIBIT III

   OPINION OF BRACEWELL AND PATTERSON, L.L.P., SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

1. Enforceable Obligations. Each New York Document (other than the Collateral
Trust Agreement) to which a Reliant Party is a party constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of such Reliant Party, enforceable against such
Reliant Party in accordance with its respective terms under the laws of the
State of New York. Each Texas Blocked Account Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each Reliant Party which is a party thereto,
enforceable against such Reliant Party in accordance with its terms under the
laws of the State of Texas. To the extent that provisions in or matters relating
to the Collateral Trust Agreement are governed by the laws of the State of New
York, the Collateral Trust Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligations of each of the Reliant Parties that are party thereto, enforceable
against such Reliant Party in accordance with its terms and the Collateral
Trustee under the laws of the State of New York. To the extent that provisions
in or matters relating to the Collateral Trust Agreement are governed by the
laws of the State of Texas, the Collateral Trust Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the Reliant Parties that are
party thereto, enforceable against such Reliant Party in accordance with its
terms and the Collateral Trustee under the laws of the State of Texas.

2. No Conflict. The execution and delivery by each Reliant Party of the Opinion
Documents (other than the 2010 Indenture and the 2013 Indenture) to which it is
a party, and the performance by such Reliant Party of its obligations thereunder
will not conflict with, constitute a default under, or violate any provision of
Applicable Law. The execution and delivery by each Reliant Party of the Opinion
Documents to which it is a party, and the performance by such Reliant Party of
its obligations thereunder, will not conflict with, constitute a default under,
or violate any provision of any other Opinion Document or any of the agreements
identified in the Exhibit list to REI's 2003 10-K and first, second and third
quarter 2004 10-Qs as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (other
than those relating to employee benefits and executive employment).

3. Forms of Financing Statements. Each Existing Delaware Financing Statement was
in appropriate form for filing and was duly filed in the Office of the Delaware
Secretary of State pursuant to the Delaware UCC. Each New Delaware UCC-3
Financing Statement is in appropriate form for filing in the Office of the
Delaware Secretary of State pursuant to the Delaware UCC.

4. Creation of Security Interests. The Security Agreement creates valid security
interests in favor of the Collateral Trustee, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties as security for the Secured Notes, the PEDFA Guarantees and the other
Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement) specified therein in
each Reliant Party's right, title, and interest in and to the Collateral (as
defined in the Security Agreement) and the proceeds thereof to the extent a
security interest may be created in such Collateral and such proceeds pursuant
to the New York UCC (such property hereinafter called the "UCC Collateral"). The
Additional Security Agreement creates a valid security interest in favor of the
Collateral Agent for the benefit for the Credit Agreement Secured Parties as
security for the Credit Agreement Obligations (as defined in the Additional
Security Agreement) in each Reliant Party's right, title, and interest in and to
the Collateral (as defined in the Additional Security Agreement) and the
proceeds thereof to the extent a security interest may be created in such
Collateral and such proceeds pursuant to the New York UCC (such property
hereinafter called the "Additional UCC Collateral").

                                  Exhibit III-1

<PAGE>

5. Perfection of Certain Collateral by Filing. (a) The acceptance for filing of
the New Delaware UCC-3 Financing Statements in the Office of the Secretary of
State of Delaware is effective to perfect or continue the perfection of the
security interests described in paragraph 4 above in the UCC Collateral and the
Additional UCC Collateral described in the Existing Delaware Financing
Statements previously filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware
to the extent such security interests may be perfected, and such perfection may
be continued, by filing a financing statement in the State of Delaware pursuant
to the Delaware UCC.

            (b) Pursuant to Section 9-301 and Section 9-307 of the New York UCC,
the law of the State of Delaware is the law governing the perfection of security
interests in the UCC Collateral and the Additional UCC Collateral for each
Reliant Party which is a registered organization (within the meaning of Section
9-102(70) of the New York UCC) under the laws of the State of Delaware, except
with respect to UCC Collateral for which the provisions of Section 9-303 through
9-306 of the New York UCC expressly provide otherwise.

6. Perfection of Securities Accounts. The provisions of the Security Agreement
and the Securities Account Control Agreements described on Exhibit B to which
any Reliant Party is a party are effective to perfect the security interests of
the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in such Reliant
Party's right, title and interest in the Securities Accounts described in such
Securities Account Control Agreements and the Securities Entitlements related
thereto. For purposes of this opinion letter, the following terms have the
meanings set forth below:

"Federal Book-Entry Regulations" means the United States Department of the
Treasury's regulations governing the transfer and pledge of marketable
securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and maintained in the form of entries in
the TRADES book-entry system in the records of the federal reserve banks and set
forth in 61 Fed. Reg. 43626 (1996) (codified at 31 C.F.R. Part 357) and the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's regulations
governing the transfer and pledge of securities issued by the Federal National
Mortgage Association ("FNMA") or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
("FHLMC") in each case maintained in the form of entries in the records of
federal reserve banks and set forth in 62 Fed. Reg. 28975 (1997) (codified at 24
C.F.R. Part 81).

"Federal Book-Entry Securities" means securities issued in book-entry form by
the United States Treasury, FNMA or FHLMC which are subject to the Federal
Book-Entry Regulations.

"Securities Account" means each "Account" described in any Securities Account
Control Agreement listed on Exhibit B.

"Securities Entitlements" means "security entitlements" (as defined in Section
8-102(a)(17) of the New York UCC) with respect to "financial assets" (as defined
in Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York UCC) now or hereafter credited to any of
the Securities Accounts and, with respect to Federal Book-Entry Securities,
"security entitlements" within the meaning of the Federal Book-Entry Regulations
with respect to Federal Book-Entry Securities now or hereafter credited to any
of the Securities Accounts.

"Securities Intermediary" means financial institution described in a Securities
Account Control Agreement listed on Exhibit B as a securities intermediary with
respect to the Securities Accounts covered thereby, acting solely in its
capacity as a "securities intermediary" as defined in the New York UCC and the
Federal Book-Entry Regulations.

7. Perfection of Texas Deposit Accounts. The provisions of the Security
Agreement and the Texas Blocked Account Agreements are sufficient to perfect the
security interests described in paragraph 4 above in favor of the Collateral
Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties as security

                                  Exhibit III-2

<PAGE>

for the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement) specified
therein, in the "Accounts" identified in the Texas Blocked Account Agreements
(the "Texas Deposit Accounts") to the extent each such Texas Deposit Account is
a "deposit account" as defined in the New York UCC and the Texas UCC.

8. Perfection of Trademark Collateral. The Trademark Security Agreement
Supplement dated as of March 28, 2003 among REI, Orion Power Holdings, Inc. and
Reliant Energy Retail Services, LLC was in proper form for filing and has been
duly filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO"). The filing of
the Amended and Restated Trademark Supplement with the PTO and the filing of
each of the Delaware UCC-1 Financing Statements naming REI and Reliant Energy
Resources Services, Inc., respectively, as debtor (each, a "TM Holder") in the
Office of the Delaware Secretary of State, was sufficient to perfect the
security interests created by the Security Agreement in favor of the Collateral
Trustee, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, in all of such TM
Holder's right, title, and interest in the Trademarks described in the Amended
and Restated Trademark Supplement Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties
as security for the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement)
specified therein.

9. Perfection of Certificated Securities and Instruments. When each Reliant
Party that has granted to the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured
Parties a security interest in certificated securities and instruments (as
defined in the New York UCC) pursuant to the Security Agreement delivers to the
Collateral Trustee in the State of New York (i) each of the certificates
representing such certificated securities, together with instruments of transfer
or assignment related thereto duly indorsed in blank by an authorized officer of
such Reliant Party, and (ii) each of such instruments, together with instruments
of transfer or assignment related thereto duly executed in blank by an
authorized officer of such Reliant Party, the Collateral Trustee for the benefit
of the Secured Parties, will have perfected security interests in such
certificated securities and such instruments under the New York UCC, and no
other security interest of any other creditor of such Reliant Party in such
certificated securities and such instruments will be equal or prior to such
security interests of the Collateral Trustee assuming neither the Collateral
Trustee nor the Secured Parties have agreed otherwise.

10. Choice of New York Law. If the issue is properly presented before such
court, a Texas or federal court applying Texas choice of law rules should hold
that the provisions contained in the New York Documents (other than such
provisions in any Mortgage) relating to the choice of New York law to govern
such Opinion Documents are valid under the laws of the State of Texas. We call
your attention to the fact that Section 8.110 and Sections 9.301 through 9.306
of the Texas UCC specify the law (including the conflict of law rules)
applicable to the perfection and priority of security interests and effect of
perfection or nonperfection of security interests in multiple state
transactions.

11. Texas Jurisdictional Issues. Except as may be otherwise required due to
other activities performed by any Creditor Party in the State of Texas unrelated
to those activities contemplated by the Opinion Documents, and provided the
performance by such Creditor Party of the transactions contemplated under the
Opinion Documents, including the soliciting of loans, gathering of financial
data, making of credit checks, or performing other financial activities through
employees, independent contractors, or agents (regardless of whether they reside
in the State of Texas), do not take place in the State of Texas, then none of
the Creditor Parties is required to qualify to do business in the State of Texas
or to comply with any foreign lender or similar statute, nor will any Creditor
Party be subject to taxation in the State of Texas, in each case solely as a
result of its execution and delivery of the Opinion Documents or by reason of
its participation in the transactions contemplated under the Opinion Documents.
No opinion is given, however, as to the need for any Creditor Party to qualify
to

                                  Exhibit III-3

<PAGE>

do business in the State of Texas should its activities in the State of Texas in
connection with its exercise of any rights or remedies under the Opinion
Documents constitute transacting business in the State of Texas.

12. PUHCA. To our knowledge after due inquiry, neither REI nor any of its
subsidiaries is, or after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Secured
Notes and the PEDFA Guarantees, will be, subject to regulation as a "holding
company", a "public-utility company", an "electric utility company", a "gas
utility company", or a "subsidiary" or "affiliate" of a "holding company" under,
and as each term is defined in, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

13. Prospectus. The statements set forth in the Prospectus Supplement dated
December 14, 2004 under the caption "Description of Notes," insofar as they
purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Security Documents, and
under the caption "Description of Certain Other Financial Obligations", insofar
as they purport to constitute summaries of the documents and instruments
referred to therein, are accurate summaries of the Security Documents and such
other documents and instruments in all material respects.

14. Governmental Approvals. No notices to, or consent, approval, authorization,
order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency
or body or REI shareholder is required under Applicable Law for (i) the grant
and perfection of security interests in the Collateral pursuant to the
provisions of the Opinion Documents or (ii) the execution, delivery or
performance by the Company and the Guarantors of their obligations pursuant to
the Opinion Documents (other than the Secured Note Documents), except for such
filings as are (w) required to perfect the Collateral Trustee's security
interests granted pursuant to the Security Documents, (x) required to perfect
the Collateral Agent's security interests granted pursuant to the Security
Documents, (y) required to release existing Liens previously granted by any
Person, or (z) made pursuant to the Opinion Documents.

                                  Exhibit III-4

<PAGE>

                                     ANNEX I

      Pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants
shall furnish letters to the Underwriters or the Independent Underwriter, as the
case may be, to the effect that:

            (i) They are independent certified public accountants with respect
      to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the
      applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;

            (ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any
      supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable,
      financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) examined by
      them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
      Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented comply as to
      form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
      of the Act and the related published rules and regulations thereunder;
      and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards
      established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of
      the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data,
      pro forma financial information, financial forecasts and/or condensed
      financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the
      Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their
      reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the
      representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives") or the
      Independent Underwriter, as the case may be;

            (iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards
      established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of
      the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated
      balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the
      Final Prospectus and/or included in the Company's quarterly report on Form
      10-Q incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus as amended or
      supplemented as indicated in their reports thereon copies of which have
      been separately furnished to the Representatives; and on the basis of
      specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the Company who
      have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether
      the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in
      paragraph (v)(A)(i) below comply as to form in the related in all material
      respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the
      related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention
      that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated
      financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects
      with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related
      published rules and regulations;

            (iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to
      the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the
      Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Final
      Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the
      Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year
      agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatements where
      applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for such five
      fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the
      Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;

            (v) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an
      examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
      consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other
      information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim
      financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of
      the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the
      latest audited financial statements included

<PAGE>

      or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus as amended or
      supplemented, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries
      responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries
      and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their
      attention that caused them to believe that:

                  (A) (i) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
            income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
            cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's
            Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the
            Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented do not comply as to form
            in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
            of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related
            published rules and regulations, or (ii) any material modifications
            should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
            income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
            cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's
            Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the
            Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, for them to be in
            conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;

                  (B) any other unaudited income statement data and balance
