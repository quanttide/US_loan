ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

           On December 29, 2004, a news article was published containing an
interview given by Jay Grinney, Chief Executive Officer of HEALTHSOUTH
Corporation ("HEALTHSOUTH" or the "Company"). The news article is attached to
this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.

           The article incorrectly reported that the Company would complete
obtaining new terms on the Company's bank loans within the next two weeks.
HEALTHSOUTH hereby clarifies that the news article should have reported that
the Company remains hopeful to obtain an amended credit facility within two
months.

           The information contained herein is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01
of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section
18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the
liabilities of that Section, unless we specifically incorporate it by reference
in a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K and furnishing this
information, we make no admission as to the materiality of any information in
this Current Report on Form 8-K.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

           Certain matters discussed herein constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which represent
HEALTHSOUTH's current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that
involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ
materially from those currently anticipated. Such information is based on
numerous assumptions (a substantial number of which are contained in the
presentation) and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which
are beyond our control, including: completion of the investigations by the SEC
and DOJ into our financial reporting; completion of the investigation by CMS
into our cost reports and other matters; the resolution of outstanding
litigation, including certain class action litigation alleging violations under
federal securities laws and certain "qui tam" actions; our ability to
successfully refinance our existing public indebtedness as it becomes due; our
ability to amend or refinance our senior bank credit facility, which is
currently in default; our ability to continue to operate in the ordinary course
and manage our relationships with our creditors, vendors and suppliers,
physician partners, employees and patients; changes, delays in or suspension of
reimbursement for our services by governmental or private payors; changes in
the regulation of the healthcare industry at either or both of the federal and
state levels, including the implementation of the recently adopted 75% Rule;
competitive pressures in the healthcare industry and our response thereto; our
ability to obtain and retain favorable arrangements with third-party payors;
and general conditions in the economy and capital markets. You are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in the
presentation.
