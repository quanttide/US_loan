<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (this &#147;Amendment&#148;) dated as of
December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004 by and among POST APARTMENT HOMES, L.P., a Georgia limited

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent have entered into that
certain Credit Agreement dated as of January&nbsp;16, 2004 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;);
and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent desire to amend certain
provisions of the Credit Agreement on the terms and conditions contained
herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. Specific Amendments to Credit Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that the Credit Agreement is amended as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Credit Agreement is amended by adding to Section&nbsp;1.1. the
following definitions in the appropriate alphabetical location:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#148;<B>Condominium Property</B>&#148; means (a)&nbsp;a Property being developed
with multiple residential condominiums on a &#147;ground up&#148; basis or
(b)&nbsp;a Multifamily Property that has been converted into
residential condominium units, in each case for the purpose of
sale. For purposes of this definition and the definition of
&#147;Condominium Property Value&#148; a Multifamily Property will be deemed
&#147;converted&#148; into residential condominium units once both of the
following have occurred: (i)&nbsp;notice of the conversion has been
sent to the tenants of such Property and (ii)&nbsp;a declaration of
condominium or other similar document is filed with the applicable
Governmental Authority.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#148;<B>Condominium Property Value</B>&#148; means (i)&nbsp;for a Multifamily
Property converted into residential condominium units, the sum of
the following: (a)&nbsp;the Net Operating Income for such Property for
the four quarter period ending immediately prior to such
conversion divided by 8.00%, plus (b)&nbsp;80% of cost of capital
improvements made to such Property in connection with such
conversion not to exceed 25% of the amount determined in
accordance with the preceding clause (a), minus (c)&nbsp;with respect
to each individual condominium unit sale, 85% of the net sale
proceeds (defined as the actual sales price less commissions, fees
and any other related expenses not to exceed 5% of the actual
sales price) from such sale; provided, however, no value will be
attributed to such a Property 24

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">months after its conversion, and (ii)&nbsp;for a Property being
developed with multiple residential condominiums on a &#147;ground up&#148;
basis, (a)&nbsp;the Construction-In-Process of such Property minus (b)
with respect to each individual condominium unit sale, 85% of the
net sale proceeds (defined as the actual sales price less
commissions, fees and any other related expenses not to exceed 5%
of the actual sales price) from such sale; provided, however, no
value will be attributed to such a Property 36&nbsp;months after actual
construction on, or other physical development of, such Property
has commenced (other than pre-development site work related to
remediation and other limited construction or development in
advance of actual project construction). For purposes of
determining Condominium Property Value, Capital Reserves shall not
be deducted from Net Operating Income. In addition, no value
shall be attributable to a Condominium Property at any time
following the earlier of (x)&nbsp;all condominium units of such
Property having been sold or otherwise conveyed and (y)&nbsp;the
management of such Property having been turned over to such
Property&#146;s homeowner&#146;s association.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Credit Agreement is amended by restating the definition of
&#147;Applicable Margin&#148; contained in Section&nbsp;1.1 as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#148;<B>Applicable Margin</B>&#148; means the percentage per annum
determined, at any time, based on the range into which the
Borrower&#146;s Credit Rating then falls, in accordance with the table
set forth below. The following provisions apply to the
determination of the Applicable Margin:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any change in the Borrower&#146;s Credit Rating which would
cause it to move to a different Level in the below table shall
effect a change in the Applicable Margin on the Business Day on
which such change occurs;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) as of the Agreement Date, the Applicable Margin is
determined based on Level 3;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) during any period that the Borrower has received Credit
Ratings that are not equivalent, the Applicable Margin shall be
determined by the higher of such two Credit Ratings;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) during any period for which the Borrower has received a
Credit Rating from only one Rating Agency, then the Applicable
Margin shall be determined based on such Credit Rating; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) during any period for which the Borrower has not received
a Credit Rating from either Rating Agency, then the Applicable
Margin shall be determined based on Level 4.

interests, exclusive of the following (but only to the extent
included in the determination of such net income (loss)): (i)
