<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Post Terminates Remarketing Agreement Related to its $100&nbsp;million of<BR>
MandatOry Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS)</I>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">ATLANTA, December&nbsp;28, 2004 &#150; Post Properties, Inc. (NYSE: PPS) announced today that it has
terminated the remarketing agreement related to its $100&nbsp;million of 6.85% MandatOry Par Put
Remarketed Securities (&#147;MOPPRS&#148;) due March&nbsp;16, 2015. In connection with the termination of
the remarketing agreement, Post will pay Merrill Lynch a total of $10.6&nbsp;million. This will
result in a charge, equal to approximately $0.25 per diluted share, which will be recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2004.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The MOPPRS were originally issued by the Company in 1998. Under the terms of the remarketing
agreement Merrill Lynch had the right to remarket the underlying unsecured bonds on the March
16, 2005 remarketing date for a ten-year term and at an interest rate to Post calculated as
5.715% plus Post&#146;s then current credit spread to the ten-year Treasury.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In addition to terminating the remarketing agreement, Post expects to pay off the $100&nbsp;million
of unsecured bonds at par on March&nbsp;16, 2005.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Said Christopher Papa, Post&#146;s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, &#147;Based on
current interest rates, the forward Treasury yield curve and our capital plans for 2005, we
have concluded that it is not in the best interest of the Company to permit the MOPPRS debt to
be remarketed for an additional ten-year term at a substantially above-market interest rate.
Having made that decision, we elected to proceed to terminate the remarketing agreement in the
fourth quarter of 2004.&#148;

including competition for tenants and development locations; the Company&#146;s ability to obtain
financing or self-fund the development or acquisition of additional apartment communities; the
uncertainties associated with the Company&#146;s current and planned future real estate development,
including actual costs exceeding the Company&#146;s budgets or development periods exceeding
expectations; uncertainties associated with the timing and amount of asset sales and the resulting
gains/losses associated with such asset sales; conditions affecting ownership of residential real
estate and general conditions in the multi-family residential real estate market; the effects of
