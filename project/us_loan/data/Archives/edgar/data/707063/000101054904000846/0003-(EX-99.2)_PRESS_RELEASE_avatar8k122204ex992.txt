Avatar Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results: Software Sales Remain Strong



Wednesday December 22, 9:00 am ET

DALLAS,  Dec. 22, 2004  (PRIMEZONE)  -- Avatar  Systems,  Inc. (OTC  BB:AVSY.OB)
announced  today a net  income of  $72,704  for the third  quarter  of 2004,  as
compared to $73,314 in Q3 of 2003.  For the 9 months ended  September  30, 2004,
net income rose to $136,337, a 134% increase from $58,178 for the same period of
2003.

The  slight  decrease  in net  income  for Q3 of 2004 is due to  unusually  high
hardware  sales within the same quarter for the prior year.  Software  sales for
the third  quarter of 2004  increased  12.9% to $130,055  compared with software
sales  of  $115,178  for the  third  quarter  of 2003.  For the 9  months  ended
September  30, 2004,  software  sales grew by 19.9% to $321,780,  compared  with
$268,304 for the same period last year.

Chuck  Shreve,  President  of Avatar  Systems,  attributes  the  steady  rise in
software sales to Avatar's ongoing effort to anticipate and meet customer needs.
"We continue to add  feature/functionality  to our existing  systems and release
new modules that address the business  critical needs of oil and gas companies,"
he said.  "Sales of the  Petroware2000  land module have surpassed  expectations
since its  release  in June of 2004.  Software  sales  should  further  increase
following the release of our production  module,  which is projected for the end
of the second quarter of 2005."

Shreve also expects to see a significant  revenue  stream  generated by Avatar's
Petroware2000  ASP service.  "We have  invested in an ASP  infrastructure  since
March of this year, creating a fault-tolerant  environment," he said. Avatar has
not yet marketed the subscription  service but has already added 8 Petroware2000
ASP  customers  since  initiating  the  program in April of this year.  "Our ASP
offering is currently generating  profitable  revenues," said Shreve. "As we add
new customers, we look for the return on investment to rise even more."

Net revenues for the third quarter of 2004 decreased 31.7% to $559,358  compared
with net revenues of $818,589 for the same period in 2003.  Net revenues for the
9 months ended  September 30, 2004,  fell by 19.8% to $1,340,571,  compared with
$1,671,209 for the same period last year. The decrease is primarily attributable
to lower  hardware  sales in the third quarter when compared with an exceptional
quarter for September  30, 2003.  Software  sales have  remained  strong for the
quarter.  "We will have an unusually high 2004 fourth quarter net revenue due to
two large hardware sales in that period," said Shreve.

According  to  Shreve,  Avatar's  market  share is likely to  increase,  as many
competitors  are leaving the  marketplace,  unable to meet customer  demands and
their  products are  obsolete.  "Avatar is committed to continued  investment in
research and  development,"  he said.  "Our cash position  remains strong and is
expected to grow as we take  advantage of greater  margins  produced by software
sales, which are expected to increase throughout the year."

resource  solutions  for  companies  engaged in the  petroleum  exploration  and
