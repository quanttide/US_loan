                                    ARTICLE I

                           PURPOSE AND EFFECTIVE DATE

     1.1 Background.  Effective October 1, 2002, Marine Products Corporation,  a
Delaware  corporation (the "Company"),  adopted the Marine Products  Corporation
Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Prior Plan").

     1.2 Purpose of Plan. The Company hereby amends and restates the Prior Plan,
effective  January  1, 2005 (the  "Effective  Date").  The  purpose  of the Plan
continues to be to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer the receipt
of a portion of their salary, bonus, and other specified cash compensation.  The
Plan is not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of
the Code. Rather, the Plan is intended to be treated as an unfunded  arrangement
providing  deferred  compensation to eligible employees who are part of a select
group of  management  or highly  compensated  employees  within  the  meaning of
Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA. Thus, the Plan is intended to be exempt from
the  requirements  of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as a "top hat"  plan,
and to be eligible for the  alternative  method of compliance  for reporting and
disclosure which is available for such plans.

     1.3 Tax  Compliance.  This Plan is intended to comply with  Section 409A of
the Code and any regulatory and other guidance issued under such Section. At the
time the  provisions  of this Plan were  finalized  prior to the January 1, 2005
effective date, the Department of Treasury had not yet issued  regulations under
Section 409A of the Code. It is the Company's  intention  that any terms of this
Plan that conflict with such future guidance shall be null and void and that any
terms that are missing from the Plan which such guidance  would require the Plan
contain to comply  with the  requirements  of Section  409A of the Code shall be
incorporated  into the Plan.  To that end,  once such  guidance  is issued,  the
Company shall conform the Plan to the  requirements  of Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations and other interpretive authority promulgated thereunder.

     1.4  Certain  Transitional  Matters.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  or
otherwise to the contrary,  with respect to deferrals and Company  Contributions
credited to  Participants'  Accounts for Deferral Periods prior to the Effective
Date, and Deemed Investment earnings thereon (collectively,  "Pre-Effective Date
Deferrals"):

          (a)  Such   Pre-Effective   Date   Deferrals   will  be   credited  to
Participants'   Retirement/Termination  Accounts.  No  In  Service  Distribution
elections may be made with respect to Pre-Effective Date Deferrals; and

          (b)  No  changes  may  be  made  to  the  Payment   Schedule  for  any
Pre-Effective  Date  Deferrals  except  as set  forth  in  Section  4.1(i).  For
avoidance of doubt, an election to change a Participant's  Payment  Schedule for
Pre-Effective  Date Deferrals to a single lump sum may not be made if, as of the
Effective Date, such Pre-Effective Date Deferrals would otherwise have been paid
in installments under the terms of the Prior Plan.

Company  to  record  Participant  deferrals,   Company   Contributions,   Deemed

required to administer the Plan. An Account shall be utilized solely as a device
to determine the value of the deferrals and Company  Contributions to be paid to
a Participant  under the Plan. An Account shall not  constitute or be treated as
an escrow,  trust fund, or any other type of funded  account for federal  income
tax purposes,  or for purposes of ERISA,  and amounts credited thereto shall not
be considered "plan assets" for federal income tax purposes,  or for purposes of
ERISA.

Compensation  Account  or any  component  Account,  the  total  value of all the

in accordance  with the  Investment  Options  selected by the  Participant.  The

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  at no time shall a Participant have or be deemed
to have any real or  beneficial  ownership  in the actual  security to which the

mirrored by an actual identical investment by the Company or a trustee acting on
behalf of the Company.

     2.15  Deferral  Period.  "Deferral  Period"  means the period  over which a
Participant  has  elected  to defer a portion of his or her  Compensation.  Each
calendar  year shall be a separate  Deferral  Period.  However,  for the initial

terms of this Plan.

     3.4 Notification. Each Employee who becomes eligible to participate in this
Plan shall be notified by the Plan  Administrator of his or her eligibility to
participate and be given an opportunity to make deferral elections hereunder.

sole  discretion  in  accordance  with  Section  409A of the Code and  published
guidance relating thereto,  deferral elections  pertaining to other Compensation
shall  be made no  later  than  the  close  of the  calendar  year  prior to the
beginning  of the period  during  which  services  are  performed  for which the
Compensation is paid.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a newly  Eligible  Employee who
becomes  eligible to be a  Participant  during any Plan Year may, in the initial


                                       7
<PAGE>

year of eligibility  only, make deferral  elections with respect to Compensation
which will be earned  during the balance of the  Deferral  Period in  accordance
with Section 3.1(c).

          (c)  Deferral  elections  shall be  effective  for an entire  Deferral
Period, and shall remain in effect from Deferral Period to Deferral Period until
modified or revoked by the  Participant  by delivering a  Compensation  Deferral
Agreement to the Plan  Administrator (or by making the appropriate  elections on
the Participant website screen) prior to the end of an annual enrollment period.
Such  modification or revocation  shall become effective on the first day of the
Deferral  Period  following  the  calendar  year in which  the  modification  or
revocation was made.

          (d) A deferral  election shall designate the amount of Compensation to
be deferred  during the Deferral  Period  either in a dollar  amount or in whole
percentages.  Separate  deferral  elections  may be made for each  component  of
Compensation.  Deferral elections will be subject to the following  limitations:
(i) for base  salary,  the maximum  deferral  percentage  will be 25%,  (ii) for
bonuses and commissions,  the maximum deferral percentage will be 50%, and (iii)
the maximum  dollar  amount of  permissible  deferrals  in any Plan Year for the
combination of base salary, bonus and commission deferrals will be $500,000.

          (e) The foregoing  paragraphs under this Section 4.1  notwithstanding,
if a  Participant's  deferral  election  results  in  insufficient  non-deferred
Compensation   from  which  to  withhold  taxes  and/or  welfare   benefit  plan
obligations in accordance  with  applicable  law and welfare plan  participation
agreements,  the  deferral  election  shall be reduced as necessary to allow the
Company to  satisfy  tax  withholding  requirements  and  welfare  benefit  plan
obligations incurred by the Participant.

          (f) All  deferrals  will be  credited to the  appropriate  Account and
Deemed Investments will be made in the investments represented by the Investment
Options  selected by the Participant as of the close of business on the Deferral
Date, or as otherwise provided by the Committee.  For base salary, the "Deferral
Date" means each payday  during the Deferral  Period.  For other  components  of
Compensation (e.g.,  commissions or bonuses), the "Deferral Date" means the date
such component of Compensation is (or would otherwise be) paid.

          (g) A deferral election will be irrevocable  except that the Committee
may permit a Participant to reduce the amount  deferred,  or waive the remainder
of the deferral election,  upon a finding, in its sole and absolute  discretion,
that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable  Emergency.  If the Committee
grants  the  application,  the  Participant  will not be  allowed  to make a new
deferral  election  for the  remainder  of the  Deferral  Period  in  which  the
reduction or waiver of the deferral  election occurs and the following  Deferral
Period.  Any resumption of the Participant's  deferrals will be made only at the
election of the Participant in accordance with this Article IV.

          (h)  The  Compensation  Deferral  Agreement  (or  Participant  website
screen) shall indicate the  Participant's  election of a Payment  Schedule for a
Participant's   Retirement/Termination  Benefit.  Permissible  Payment  Schedule
elections for the Retirement/Termination Benefit include: (i) a portion, or all,
in a single lump sum payable as soon as administratively  practicable  following
the Termination Valuation Date; and (ii) the balance (if any) in up to 10 annual
installment  payments  payable at the time described in Section 5.3. An election


                                       8
<PAGE>

of a Retirement/Termination Benefit Payment Schedule shall pertain to the entire
Retirement/Termination  Benefit Account  Balance;  provided,  however,  that the
Compensation  Deferral  Agreement  may not change an existing  Payment  Schedule
election  except to the extent  permitted by Section 4.1(i) below. To the extent
permitted by Section 409A of the Code and  regulations and other guidance issued
thereunder,   a  Participant   may  elect  a  separate   Payment   Schedule  for
Retirement/Termination Benefits following a Change in Control.

          (i) No changes may be made to a  Participant's  Retirement/Termination
Payment Schedule  election unless:  (i) such election is made at least 13 months
prior to the Participant's  date of Termination of Employment;  (ii) such change
does  not  accelerate  previously  elected  payments  (e.g.,  does  not  shorten
installment periods or change installment payments to lump sum payments),  (iii)
the first  payment with respect to which such  election is made is not less than
five years from the date such payment  would  otherwise  have been made and (iv)
such change fully complies with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and
other   guidance   issued   thereunder.    Any   change   to   a   Participant's
Retirement/Termination Payment Schedule election shall be made on a Compensation
Deferral Agreement or by following such procedures  regarding changes to Payment
Schedule elections on the Participant website, when available.

          (j) Any Payment Schedule election made within 13 months of Termination
of  Employment  shall be null and void,  and the most  recent  payment  schedule
election  which is dated at least 13 months prior to  Termination  of Employment
shall be deemed to be in effect. In the event a Participant has not made a valid
Payment Schedule election, the Retirement/Termination  Benefit will be paid in a
single lump sum.

          (k) Amounts credited to a Participant's Retirement/Termination Account
shall at all times remain credited to the  Participant's  Retirement/Termination
Account until distributed to the Participant or the  Participant's  Beneficiary.
Amounts  credited to a Participant's  Retirement/Termination  Account may not be
credited or  reallocated to an In Service  Account  established on behalf of the
Participant.

     4.2 In Service Distribution Date Election.

          (a) A Participant  will be allowed to elect on his or her Compensation
Deferral  Agreement  (or  Participant  website  screen)  one or more In  Service
Distribution Dates relating to all or a portion of the deferred Compensation for
that Deferral Period. The Plan Administrator  shall create an In Service Account
for each separate In Service  Distribution  Date.  If an In Service  Account has
already been  established for the In Service  Distribution  Date selected by the
Participant,  such  portion of  deferred  Compensation  shall be credited to the
existing In Service Account.

          (b) A Participant may maintain no more than three In Service  Accounts
at any time.

          (c) No change  (including a cancellation) may be made to an In Service
Distribution  Date  unless:  (i) the date the change of election is submitted to
the  Plan  Administrator  is  at  least  13  months  prior  to  the  In  Service
Distribution  Date  intended  to be  changed;  (ii) the  resulting  distribution
commencement  date  is no  less  than  five  full  years  from  the  In  Service
Distribution  Date being extended;  and (iii) such In Service  Distribution Date


                                       9
<PAGE>

change (or cancellation) otherwise complies in all respects with Section 409A of
the  Code  and  the   regulations   and  other   guidance   issued   thereunder.
Notwithstanding  anything  herein  or  otherwise  to the  contrary,  In  Service
Distribution Dates may not be accelerated.  An change (including a cancellation)
to an In Service Distribution Date must be made by submitting a new Compensation
Deferral  Agreement  or such  other  form  as may be  provided  for by the  Plan
Administrator  for In Service  Distribution  Date changes (or by completing  and
electronically  submitting the appropriate  screen on the  Participant  website,
when  available).  If a new  In  Service  Distribution  Date  corresponds  to an
existing In Service  Distribution Date, the In Service Accounts will be combined
into  one  In  Service  Account.  A  change  or  cancellation  to an In  Service
Distribution  Date must be made with  respect to the  entire In Service  Account
Balance. A change or cancellation will not affect other In Service Distributions
or the Participant's ability to make new In Service Distribution  elections with
respect  to  future  deferrals  as  long  as  the  total  number  of In  Service
Distribution Dates does not exceed three.

          (d)  Any  portion  of  a  deferral  not  credited  to  an  In  Service
Distribution Account will be credited to the Retirement/Termination Account.

          (e) The  Compensation  Deferral  Agreement  shall  also  indicate  the
Participant's  Payment Schedule election for each In Service  Distribution Date.
Permissible  Payment  Schedules for In Service  Distributions  are: (i) a single
lump sum or (ii) from two to five annual installment payments.

          (f) No  changes  may be made to a  Participant's  In  Service  Payment
Schedule election unless:  (i) such election is made at least 13 months prior to
the In  Service  Distribution  Date being  changed;  (ii) such  change  does not
accelerate  previously  elected  payments  (e.g.,  does not shorten  installment
periods or change  installment  payments to lump sum payments),  (iii) the first
payment with respect to which such  election is made is not less than five years
from the date such payment would  otherwise  have been made and (iv) such change
fully  complies  with  Section  409A of the Code and the  regulations  and other
guidance issued  thereunder.  Any change to a  Participant's  In Service Payment
Schedule  election  shall be made on a  Compensation  Deferral  Agreement  or by
following such procedures regarding changes to Payment Schedule elections on the
Participant website, when available.

     4.3 Company Contributions and Vesting.

          (a) Enhanced Benefit Contribution. Certain Participants, identified on
Exhibit A, are eligible for the Enhanced  Benefit  Contribution.  Beginning with
the 2005 Plan Year and each Plan Year thereafter  through and including the 2008
Plan Year,  the  Company  may,  in its sole  discretion,  credit to an  eligible
Participant's  Retirement/Termination  Account the amount indicated on Exhibit A
provided that such  Participant is still employed by his or her Employer through
the last day of the applicable  Plan Year. Such  contribution  (if made) will be
effective on the last day of the applicable  Plan Year. If a Participant  who is
eligible for the Enhanced Benefit Contribution  terminates employment before the
last day of any Plan Year,  the Enhanced  Benefit  Contribution  amount shall be
zero. Enhanced Benefit Contributions are 100% vested.

          (b) Company Discretionary  Contributions.  In addition to the Enhanced
Benefit  Contribution in Section 4.3(a) above,  the Company may, in its sole and
absolute  discretion,  make discretionary  Company  Contributions to one or more
Participants.  Discretionary  Company  Contributions  shall be  credited at such


                                       10
<PAGE>

times and in such amounts as the Company in its sole discretion  shall determine
to an eligible Participant's  Retirement/Termination  Account. The Company shall
have no obligation to make discretionary Company Contributions  pursuant to this
Section  4.3(b).  Each  discretionary  Company  Contribution,   and  the  Deemed
Investment earnings thereon,  shall be subject to a vesting schedule established
by the Company and communicated by the Plan Administrator to the Participant. If
no vesting  schedule has been  communicated  to a Participant  with respect to a
discretionary  Company  Contribution  pursuant  to  this  Section  4.3(b),  such
discretionary  Company  Contribution  shall  vest  at the end of the  Plan  Year
following the Plan Year during which the discretionary  Company Contribution was
credited to the Participant's Account.

          (c) Deemed Investments of Company  Contributions  shall be made in the
same manner as for deferrals as described in Section 4.4 on the date the Company
Contribution is credited to the Participant's Account.

     4.4 Allocation Elections and Valuation of Accounts.

          (a) A  Participant  shall be allowed to select one or more  Investment
Options from a list provided by the  Committee.  The initial  election  shall be
made on the  Allocation  Election form approved by the Committee (or  Allocation
Election screen on the Participant  website approved by the Committee) and shall
specify the allocations among the Investment Options selected. A Participant may
make different Allocation  Elections for each Account. A Participant's  Accounts
shall be  valued  as the sum of the value of all  Deemed  Investments  minus any
withdrawals or distributions from the relevant Account. Investment Options shall
be  utilized  to  determine  the value of an Account.  Elections  of  Investment
Options do not represent actual ownership of, nor ownership rights in or to, the
securities or other  investments to which the Investment  Options refer,  nor is
the  Company  in  any  way  bound  or   directed  to  make  actual   investments
corresponding to Deemed Investments.

          (b) The Committee,  in its sole discretion,  shall be permitted to add
or remove  Investment  Options  provided that any such  additions or removals of
Investment  Options  shall not be effective  with respect to any period prior to
the effective date of such change. Any unallocated  portion of an Account or any
unallocated  portion of new deferrals  shall be Deemed Invested in an Investment
Option referring to a money market based fund.

          (c) A Participant  may make a new Allocation  Election with respect to
future deferrals or current Account  Balances (or both),  provided that such new
allocations  shall  be in  increments  of 1% and  apply  to the  entire  Account
Balance.  Subject to restrictions on the timing and number of permitted  changes
to  Allocation   Elections  within  certain  time  periods  established  by  the
Committee,  new  Allocation  Elections may be made on any business day, and will
become effective on the first business day following the date the new Allocation
Election is requested by the Participant.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall
have the sole and exclusive  authority to invest any or all amounts set aside to
pay  benefits  hereunder,   regardless  of  any  Allocation   Elections  by  any
Participant.  A  Participant's  Allocation  Election  shall be used  solely  for
purposes  of  determining  the value of his or her  Accounts  and the  Company's
obligation to the Participant pursuant to this Plan.



                                       11

     4.5 Beneficiary Designation.

          (a) Subject to Section 4.5(c),  each Participant shall have the right,
at any time, to designate one or more persons or an entity as Beneficiary  (both
primary as well as secondary) to whom benefits under this Plan are to be paid in
the event of such  Participant's  death  prior to complete  distribution  of the
Participant's  Accounts. Each beneficiary designation shall be in a written form
prescribed by the Plan Administrator and shall be effective only when filed with
the Plan Administrator during the Participant's lifetime.

          (b) Subject to Section 4.5(c), any Beneficiary designation, other than
a Participant's spouse, may be changed by the Participant without the consent of
the previously  named  Beneficiary by filing a new Beneficiary  designation form
with the Plan Administrator.  The filing of a new properly-completed Beneficiary
designation shall cancel all Beneficiary designations previously made.

          (c) If the  Participant  resides in a community  property  state,  any
Beneficiary  designation  shall be valid or effective  only as  permitted  under
applicable law.

          (d) If a Participant  fails to designate a  Beneficiary  in the manner
provided  in  Section  4.5(a)  above  and  subject  to  Section  4.5(c),  if the
Beneficiary  designation is void, or if the Beneficiary designated by a deceased
Participant  dies before the Participant or before complete  distribution of the
Participant's Accounts, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the person in the
first of the following classes in which there is a survivor:

               (i)  The Participant's spouse;

               (ii) The Participant's  children in equal shares,  except that if
                    any of the children  predeceases  the Participant but leaves
                    issue  surviving,  then such issue shall  take,  by right of
                    representation,  the share the  parent  would  have taken if
                    then living; or

              (iii) The Participant's estate.

                                    ARTICLE V

                          DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS

     5.1 In Service  Distributions.  Subject to the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code:

          (a) Each In Service  Distribution shall be paid in accordance with the
Payment  Schedule  election  made with  respect  thereto,  beginning  as soon as
administratively  practicable  following the In Service  Distribution  Valuation
Date.  In the event a  Participant  has elected  installment  payments for an In
Service Distribution,  the installment payments shall be determined as set forth
in Section 5.4.

          (b) Notwithstanding a Participant's  election to receive an In Service
Distribution,  all In Service Account Balances shall be distributable as part of


                                       12
<PAGE>

a  Retirement/Termination,  Disability,  or Death Benefit if the triggering date
for  such  Benefit  occurs  prior  to the  completion  of  payments  elected  in
connection with any In Service Distribution Date.

     5.2   Retirement/Termination   Benefit   Distribution.   Subject   to   the
requirements  of  Section  409A of the  Code,  in the event  that a  Participant
experiences a Termination of Employment, the Retirement/Termination Benefit will
be  paid  to  such   Participant   in   accordance   with   such   Participant's
Retirement/Termination     Benefit    Payment     Schedule     election.     The
Retirement/Termination Benefit will be paid (or the first payment will commence)
by the  Company  or the  Participating  Employer  as  soon  as  administratively
practicable following the Termination Valuation Date.

     5.3  Installment  Payments.  If the  Participant  has  elected  installment
payments   for   his  or  her   Participant's   Retirement/Termination   Benefit
distribution  or an In Service  Distribution,  annual cash payments will be made
beginning  as soon as  administratively  practicable  following  the  applicable
Valuation  Date  (Termination  or In Service) or, in the event of a partial lump
sum election,  following the first  anniversary  of the partial lump sum payment
made following Termination of Employment.  Such payments shall continue annually
on or about the anniversary of the previous installment payment until the number
of installment  payments  elected has been paid. The installment  payment amount
shall be determined  annually as the result of a  calculation,  performed on the
Annual Valuation Date, where (i) is divided by (ii):

               (i)  equals  the value of the  applicable  Account  on the Annual
                    Valuation Date; and

               (ii) equals the remaining number of installment payments.

     5.4 Small  Account  Balance Lump Sum  Payment.  Anything to the contrary in
this Plan notwithstanding,  in the event that a Participant's Account Balance is
less  than  $10,000  on  the  initial  Termination  or In  Service  Distribution
Valuation Date, the In Service Distribution or  Retirement/Termination  Benefit,
as  applicable,  shall  be paid in a single  lump  sum and any  form of  payment
election to the contrary shall be null and void.

     5.5 Disability  Benefit.  In the event a Participant  suffers a Disability,
the Disability Benefit shall be paid by the Company or Participating Employer as
soon as  administratively  practicable  following the Valuation Date, which, for
purposes of the Disability  Benefit,  shall be the end of the month in which the
onset of Disability occurs.

     5.6 Death  Benefit.  In the event of a  Participant's  death either  before
Termination  of Employment  or before  complete  distribution  of any In Service
Distribution or  Retirement/Termination  Benefit, such Participant's Beneficiary
shall  be  paid  a  Death  Benefit  in the  amount  of  the  remaining  Deferred
Compensation  Account  Balance  in a  single  lump  sum as soon  as  practicable
following the end of the month in which the  Participant's  death occurred.  The
Valuation Date for purposes of  determining  the Death Benefit shall be the last
day of the month in which the Participant's death occurs.

     5.7 Unforeseeable  Emergency.  A Participant may request, in writing to the
Plan Administrator,  a withdrawal from his or her Deferred  Compensation Account
if  the   Participant   experiences  an   Unforeseeable   Emergency.   The  Plan


                                       13
<PAGE>

Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether a Participant has
experienced an  Unforeseeable  Emergency.  Withdrawals of amounts  because of an
Unforeseeable  Emergency are limited to the extent  reasonably needed to satisfy
the emergency need, which cannot be met with other resources of the Participant.
The amount of such Unforeseeable  Emergency withdrawal shall be subtracted first
from the vested  portion  of the  Participant's  Retirement/Termination  Account
until  depleted  and then from the In  Service  Distribution  Accounts  (if any)
beginning  with the most  distant  distribution  commencement  date.  Values for
purposes of administering  this Section shall be determined on the date the Plan
Administrator approves the amount of the Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal,  or
such other date determined by the Plan Administrator.

     5.8 Court  Order.  Subject to  restrictions  imposed by Section 409A of the
Code,  if  any,  in the  event  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  orders  a
distribution  of part, or all, of a  Participant's  Account  pursuant to a valid
judgment or court order, the Plan Administrator shall make a distribution to the
Participant  or other  recipient  named in the  judgment  or court  order in the
amount necessary to satisfy the judgment or court order.

     5.9 Change in Control.  To the extent  permitted  by  regulations  or other
guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 409A of the Code,
distributions  payable as a result of  Termination  of  Employment  following  a
Change in Control shall be paid pursuant to the Payment Schedule selected by the
Participant   in   his   or   her   Compensation    Deferral   Agreement.    For
Retirement/Termination  Benefit  distributions  following a Change in Control, a
Participant  may select any of the Payment  Schedules  available  under  Section
4.1(h).  This  Section  5.9 will not  apply  until  such  regulations  (or other
applicable guidance) are effective.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                 ADMINISTRATION

     6.1 Plan Administration.  This Plan shall be administered by the Committee,
which shall have discretionary  authority to make, amend,  interpret and enforce
all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and to
utilize its discretion to decide or resolve any and all questions, including but
not limited to eligibility for benefits and interpretations of this Plan and its
terms,  as may arise in connection  with the Plan.  Claims for benefits shall be
filed with the Committee and resolved in accordance  with the claims  procedures
in Article IX.

     6.2  Withholding.  The Employer  shall have the right to withhold  from any
payment  made under the Plan (or any amount  deferred  under the Plan) any taxes
required  by law to be withheld in respect of such  payment  (or  deferral).  In
addition,  the  Employer  shall  also  have the  right to  withhold  from  other
Compensation  or other amounts  payable to the  Participant,  or require payment
from the Participant, for any taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of
payments and/or deferrals under the Plan.

     6.3  Indemnification.  The Company  shall  indemnify and hold harmless each
employee, officer, director, agent or organization,  to whom or to which duties,
responsibilities,  and authority with respect to  administration of the Plan are
delegated,  against  all  claims,  liabilities,  fines  and  penalties,  and all
expenses  reasonably  incurred by or imposed upon him, her or it (including  but
not limited to reasonable  attorney fees) which arise as a result of his, her or
its  actions  or  failure  to  act  in   connection   with  the   operation  and
administration  of the Plan to the extent  lawfully  allowable and to the extent
that  such  claim,  liability,  fine,  penalty,  or  expense  is not paid for by
liability  insurance  purchased or paid for by the Company.  Notwithstanding the


                                       14
<PAGE>

foregoing,  the Company shall not indemnify any person or  organization  if his,
her or its  actions  or failure  to act are due to gross  negligence  or willful
misconduct or for any such amount incurred  through any settlement or compromise
of any action  unless the  Company  consents  in writing to such  settlement  or
compromise.

     6.4 Expenses.  The expenses of administering  the Plan shall be paid by the
Company.

     6.5  Delegation  of  Authority.  In the  administration  of this Plan,  the
Committee   may,  from  time  to  time,   employ  agents   (including  the  Plan
Administrator) and delegate to them such  administrative  duties as it sees fit,
and may from time to time consult with legal counsel who may be legal counsel to
the Company. To the extent that such responsibilities have been delegated to the
Plan  Administrator  by the Committee,  the Plan  Administrator  may also employ
agents and delegate to them such  administrative  duties as it sees fit, and may
from time to time  consult  with legal  counsel who may be legal  counsel to the
Company

     6.6 Binding  Decisions or Actions.  The decision or action of the Committee
in  respect  of  any  question   arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  the
administration,  interpretation  and  application  of the Plan and the rules and
regulations  thereunder  shall be final  and  conclusive  and  binding  upon all
persons having any interest in the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     The Plan is intended to be  permanent,  but the  Committee  may at any time
modify, amend, or terminate the Plan, provided that such modification, amendment
or  termination  shall not cancel,  reduce,  or otherwise  adversely  affect the
amount of benefits of any Participant  accrued (and any form of payment elected)
as of the date of any such modification,  amendment, or termination, without the
consent of the Participant.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                INFORMAL FUNDING

     8.1 General  Assets.  All benefits in respect of a  Participant  under this
Plan shall be paid directly from the general funds of the Employer,  or a "rabbi
trust"  created by the  Company and funded by the  Employers  for the purpose of
informally  funding the Plan,  and other than such rabbi trust,  if created,  no
special or separate fund shall be established and no other segregation of assets
shall be made to assure  payment.  No Participant,  spouse or Beneficiary  shall
have any right,  title or interest  whatever in or to any  investments  which an
Employer  may make to aid the  Employer  in meeting  its  obligation  hereunder.
Nothing  contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions,
shall  create or be  construed  to create a trust of any  kind,  or a  fiduciary
relationship,  between the  Employer or any if its  subsidiaries  or  affiliated
companies and any Employee,  Participant,  spouse of an Employee or Participant,
or  Beneficiary.  To the  extent  that any  person  acquires  a right to receive
payments from the Employer hereunder,  such rights are no greater than the right
of an unsecured general creditor of the Employer.

     8.2 Rabbi  Trust.  The  Company  may, at its sole  discretion,  establish a
grantor trust,  commonly known as a "rabbi trust", as a vehicle for accumulating
the assets needed to pay the promised benefit, but the Company shall be under no
obligation to establish any such trust or any other  informal  funding  vehicle.
Any trust established hereunder shall comply with the applicable requirements of
Section  409A  of the  Code  and  the  regulations  and  other  guidance  issued
thereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                     CLAIMS

     9.1  Claim.  The  Committee  shall  establish  rules and  procedures  to be
followed by Participants  and  Beneficiaries  in (a) filing claims for benefits,
and (b)  furnishing  and  verifying  proofs  necessary to establish the right to
benefits in  accordance  with this Plan,  consistent  with the remainder of this
Article IX. Such rules and  regulations  shall require that claims and proofs be
made in writing and directed by the Committee.

     9.2 Filing a Claim.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
the Plan shall be filed with the Committee  which shall make all  determinations
concerning such claim. Any decision by the Committee denying such claim shall be
in writing and shall be delivered to the  Participant or Beneficiary  filing the
claim ("Claimant").

          (a) In General.  Notice of a denial of benefits (other than Disability
benefits)  will be  provided  within 90 days of the  Committee's  receipt of the
Claimant's  claim  for  benefits.  If the  Committee  determines  that it  needs
additional  time to review the claim,  the  Committee  will provide the Claimant
with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 90-day period.  The
extension  will  not be more  than 90 days  from the end of the  initial  90-day
period and the notice of extension will explain the special  circumstances  that
require  the  extension  and the date by which the  Committee  expects to make a
decision.

          (b) Disability Benefits.  Notice of denial of Disability benefits will
be provided  within 45 days of the Committee's  receipt of the Claimant's  claim
for Disability  benefits.  If the Committee  determines that it needs additional
time to review the  Disability  claim,  the Committee  will provide the Claimant
with a notice of the extension  before the end of the initial 45-day period.  If
the  Committee  determines  that a  decision  cannot  be made  within  the first
extension  period due to matters beyond the control of the  Committee,  the time
period for making a determination  may be further  extended for an additional 30
days. If such an additional  extension is necessary,  the Committee shall notify
the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day extension. Any notice
of extension  shall indicate the  circumstances  necessitating  the extension of
time,  the date by which the Committee  expects to furnish a notice of decision,
the specific  standards  on which such  entitlement  to a benefit is based,  the
unresolved  issues  that  prevent a  decision  on the  claim and any  additional
information  needed to  resolve  those  issues.  A Claimant  will be  provided a
minimum  of 45  days to  submit  any  necessary  additional  information  to the
Committee. In the event that a 30-day extension is necessary due to a Claimant's
failure  to submit  information  necessary  to decide a claim,  the  period  for
furnishing  a notice  of  decision  shall be  tolled  from the date on which the
notice of the  extension is sent to the  Claimant  until the earlier of the date
the Claimant responds to the request for additional  information or the response
deadline.

          (c)  Contents  of Notice.  If a claim for  benefits is  completely  or
partially denied,  notice of such denial shall be in writing and shall set forth
the  reasons  for  denial  in plain  language.  The  notice  shall  (i) cite the
pertinent  provisions of the Plan document and (ii) explain,  where appropriate,
how  the  Claimant  can  perfect  the  claim,  including  a  description  of any
additional material or information  necessary to complete the claim and why such
material or  information  is  necessary.  The claim denial also shall include an
explanation of the claims review  procedures  and the time limits  applicable to
such procedures,  including a statement of the Claimant's right to bring a civil
action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse decision on review. In
the case of a complete or partial  denial of a  Disability  benefit  claim,  the
notice  shall  provide  a  statement  that the  Committee  will  provide  to the
Claimant,  upon  request  and  free  of  charge,  a copy of any  internal  rule,
guideline,  protocol,  or other similar criterion that was relied upon in making
the decision.

     9.3 Appeal of Denied Claims.  A Claimant whose claim has been completely or
partially  denied  shall be  entitled  to appeal  the  claim  denial by filing a
written  appeal with the Committee.  A Claimant who timely  requests a review of
the denied  claim (or his or her  authorized  representative)  may review,  upon
request  and  free  of  charge,  copies  of all  documents,  records  and  other
information  relevant to the denial and may submit written comments,  documents,
records  and  other  information  relevant  to the claim to the  Committee.  All
written comments,  documents, records, and other information shall be considered
"relevant"  if the  information  (i)  was  relied  upon  in  making  a  benefits
determination,  (ii) was  submitted,  considered  or  generated in the course of
making a benefits decision  regardless of whether it was relied upon to make the
decision,  or (iii) demonstrates  compliance with  administrative  processes and
safeguards  established for making benefit decisions.  The Committee may, in its
sole  discretion  and if it deems  appropriate  or  necessary,  decide to hold a
hearing with respect to the claim appeal.

          (a) In General.  Appeal of a denied benefits claim (other than a claim
relating to Disability  Benefits) must be filed in writing with the Committee no
later than sixty (60) days after  receipt of the  written  notification  of such
claim denial.  The Committee shall make its decision regarding the merits of the
denied claim within 60 days following  receipt of the appeal (or within 120 days
after such receipt,  in a case where there are special  circumstances  requiring
extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). If an extension of time for
reviewing  the appeal is  required  because of  special  circumstances,  written
notice  of the  extension  shall  be  furnished  to the  Claimant  prior  to the
commencement   of  the   extension.   The  notice  will   indicate  the  special
circumstances  requiring  the  extension  of time  and the  date  by  which  the
Committee  expects to render the  determination on review.  The review will take
into account comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the
Claimant  relating to the claim without regard to whether such  information  was
submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.

          (b)  Disability  Benefits.  Appeal  of  a  denied  claim  relating  to
Disability  Benefits  must be filed in writing with the  Committee no later than
180 days after receipt of the written  notification  of such claim  denial.  The
review shall be conducted by the Committee (exclusive of the person who made the
initial adverse decision or such person's subordinate). In reviewing the appeal,
the Committee shall (i) not afford deference to the initial denial of the claim,
(ii) consult a medical  professional who has appropriate training and experience
in the field of  medicine  relating  to the  Claimant's  disability  and who was


                                       17
<PAGE>

neither  consulted as part of the initial denial nor is the  subordinate of such
individual and (ii) identify the medical or vocational  experts whose advice was
obtained with respect to the initial benefit  denial,  without regard to whether
the advice was relied upon in making the decision.  The Committee shall make its
decision  regarding  the merits of the  denied  claim  within 45 days  following
receipt of the appeal  (or  within 90 days after such  receipt,  in a case where
there are special  circumstances  requiring  extension of time for reviewing the
appealed  claim).  If an extension of time for  reviewing the appeal is required
because of  special  circumstances,  written  notice of the  extension  shall be
furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice
will indicate the special circumstances  requiring the extension of time and the
date by which the  Committee  expects  to render  the  determination  on review.
Following its review of any  additional  information  submitted by the Claimant,
the Committee shall render a decision on its review of the denied claim.

          (c) Contents of Notice. If a benefits claim is completely or partially
denied on review,  notice of such denial shall be in writing and shall set forth
the reasons for denial in plain language.

               (1) The  decision  on review  shall  set  forth (i) the  specific
reason or reasons for the denial, (ii) specific references to the pertinent Plan
provisions on which the denial is based,  (iii) a statement that the Claimant is
entitled to receive,  upon request and free of charge,  reasonable access to and
copies of all  documents,  records,  or other  information  relevant (as defined
above) to the Claimant's  claim,  and (iv) a statement  describing any voluntary
appeal procedures offered by the plan and a statement of the Claimant's right to
bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.

               (2) For the denial of a Disability Benefit,  the notice will also
include a statement  that the Committee  will provide,  upon request and free of
charge,  (i) any internal rule,  guideline,  protocol or other similar criterion
relied upon in making the decision, (ii) any medical opinion relied upon to make
the    decision    and   (iii)   the   required    statement    under    Section
2560.503-1(j)(5)(iii) of the Department of Labor regulations.

     9.4 Legal Action.  A Claimant may not bring any legal action  relating to a
claim for benefits under the Plan unless and until the Claimant has followed the
claims  procedures  under  the  Plan  and  exhausted  his or her  administrative
remedies under such claims  procedures.  Legal action must be brought within two
years of the date the claim first arose.

     9.5  Discretion  of  Committee.  All  interpretations,  determinations  and
decisions of the  Committee  with respect to any claim shall be made in its sole
discretion,  and shall be final,  conclusive and binding upon all persons having
any interest in this Plan.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     10.1  Adoption by  Affiliates.  Any  subsidiary or affiliate of the Company
may, with the approval of the Committee,  adopt this Plan by appropriate  action
of its board of directors,  and thereby  become a  Participating  Employer.  Any
Participating  Employer  may, by  appropriate  action of its board of directors,
terminate  its  participation  in the  Plan.  The  Committee  may,  in its  sole
discretion,  terminate a Participating  Employer's  participation in the Plan at
any time. The termination of the  participation  in this Plan by a Participating
Employer will not,  however,  affect the rights that any Participant may have to
amounts credited to his or her Deferred  Compensation Account without his or her
written consent.

     10.2  Anti-assignment  Rule.  No  interest  of any  Participant,  spouse or
Beneficiary  under this Plan and no benefit payable  hereunder shall be assigned
as security for a loan, and any such purported  assignment  shall be null,  void
and of no effect,  nor shall any such interest or any such benefit be subject in
any  manner,  either  voluntarily  or  involuntarily,  to  anticipation,   sale,
transfer,  assignment or  encumbrance by or through any  Participant,  spouse or
Beneficiary.

     10.3 No Legal or Equitable  Rights or  Interest.  No  Participant  or other
person  shall have any legal or  equitable  rights or interest in this Plan that
are not expressly granted in this Plan. Participation in this Plan does not give
any person any right to be  retained in the service of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies. The right and power of the Company (or any
of its subsidiaries or affiliated  companies that is the Employee's employer) to
dismiss or discharge an Employee is expressly reserved.

     10.4 No Employment Contract. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to
constitute a contract of  employment  between an Employee and the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

     10.5 Headings. The headings of Sections are included solely for convenience
of reference, and if there is any conflict between such headings and the text of
this Plan, the text shall control.

     10.6 Invalid or  Unenforceable  Provisions.  If any  provision of this Plan
shall be held invalid or  unenforceable,  such  invalidity  or  unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions  hereof and the Committee may elect in its
sole discretion to construe such invalid or unenforceable provisions in a manner
that conforms to applicable law or as if such provisions,  to the extent invalid
or unenforceable, had not been included.

     10.7 Governing  Law. To the extent not preempted by ERISA,  the laws of the
State of Georgia shall govern the construction and administration of the Plan.
