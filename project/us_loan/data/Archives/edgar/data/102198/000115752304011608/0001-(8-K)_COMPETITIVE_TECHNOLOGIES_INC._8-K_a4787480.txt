Item 8.01 Other Events.

     On December 16, 2004, Competitive Technologies, Inc. ("CTT") announced that
a license had been granted to Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") under CTT's U.S.
Patent Number 4,940,658 for homocysteine assays. The granting of the license
settled previously filed litigation between CTT and Abbott.

     Pursuant to the license Abbott will pay a license fee and royalties on
sales of Abbott homocysteine assays. The license will relieve Abbott customers
from their obligation to pay royalties on results obtained using the Abbott
assay by virtue of the royalty paid by Abbott to CTT. CTT's share of the license
fee (that will be paid in January 2005) will be $5.2 million. The license also
releases Abbott's customers of any obligation to pay royalties to CTT for
homocysteine test results obtained using Abbott assays in the past, but does not
entitle them to any refund of any royalties previously paid to CTT.


A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
