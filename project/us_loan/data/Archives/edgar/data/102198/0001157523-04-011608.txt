Item 8.01 Other Events.

     On December 16, 2004, Competitive Technologies, Inc. ("CTT") announced that
a license had been granted to Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") under CTT's U.S.
Patent Number 4,940,658 for homocysteine assays. The granting of the license
settled previously filed litigation between CTT and Abbott.

     Pursuant to the license Abbott will pay a license fee and royalties on
sales of Abbott homocysteine assays. The license will relieve Abbott customers
from their obligation to pay royalties on results obtained using the Abbott
assay by virtue of the royalty paid by Abbott to CTT. CTT's share of the license
fee (that will be paid in January 2005) will be $5.2 million. The license also
releases Abbott's customers of any obligation to pay royalties to CTT for
homocysteine test results obtained using Abbott assays in the past, but does not
entitle them to any refund of any royalties previously paid to CTT.


A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

              COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES LICENSES HOMOCYSTEINE PATENT
                                    TO ABBOTT

       Abbott Homocysteine Assays Carry Pass-Through License to Customers

Fairfield, CT and Abbott Park, IL (December 16, 2004) - Competitive
Technologies, Inc. (AMEX: CTT) and Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that a
homocysteine patent license has been granted to Abbott under CTT's U.S. Patent
Number 4,940,658 and its foreign counterparts relating to homocysteine medical
tests.

Under terms of the agreement, Abbott is granted a license to the CTT technology
and will pay royalties on sales of Abbott homocysteine assays. Abbott's
homocysteine assay customers will be covered by the Abbott license from CTT.
Abbott customers such as hospital and commercial laboratories that have separate
homocysteine licenses from CTT will be relieved of their obligation to pay
royalties on reportable homocysteine results obtained using the Abbott assay by
virtue of the royalty paid by Abbott to CTT.

The agreement between CTT and Abbott includes a release to Abbott's customers of
any obligation to pay royalties to CTT for homocysteine test results obtained
using Abbott assays in the past. CTT has agreed not to pursue royalties from any
current or future Abbott customer with respect to past homocysteine assay tests
purchased from other diagnostic companies. CTT is pursuing such royalties
directly from the supplier diagnostic companies and reserves its rights against
these supplier diagnostics companies.

The license does not relieve Abbott customers for royalties on past or future
assays for methylmalonic acid. Customers should contact CTT for a license to
perform such assays.

The homocysteine patent is derived from discoveries made by CTT's clients, Drs.
Robert Allen and Sally Stabler from the University of Colorado and the late Dr.
John Lindenbaum from Columbia University.
