partners, consumers, suppliers, shareholders, vendors, and investors. Executive further
acknowledges and agrees that there is a risk and opportunity for any person given such
responsibility, specialized training, and Confidential Information, to misappropriate the
relationship and goodwill existing between the Company and the Company&#146;s current and prospective
customers, business partners, consumers, suppliers, shareholders, vendors and investors. Executive
therefore acknowledges and agrees that it is fair and reasonable for the Company to take steps to
protect itself from the risk of such misappropriation. In consideration of the Company&#146;s promise
to provide Confidential Information to Executive, this Agreement, and the severance payments to be
made under the Severance Agreement, and in order to protect the Company&#146;s interests in the

business with a business model similar to the Company&#146;s, engaged in the sale of apparel or other
products similar to those sold or marketed by the Company or any product lines or lines of business
under development or consideration by the Company during the Term; provided, however, a general
department store that includes as less than 10% of its sales revenues merchandise competitive with
that offered by the Company will not be deemed a Competitor.

training, and the Confidential Information provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement gives
rise to the Company&#146;s interest in restraining Executive from competing with the Company, that the
noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants are designed to enforce such consideration and that
any limitations as to time, geographic scope and scope of activity to be restrained as defined
herein are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the
goodwill or other business interest of the Company.

minimum extent necessary, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law
as it shall then appear.

knowledge he has no obligations, legal, in contract, or otherwise, inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement or with his undertaking employment with the Company to perform the duties described
herein. Executive will not disclose to the Company, or use, or induce the Company to use, any
confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information of others. Executive represents and warrants
that to his knowledge he has returned all property and confidential information belonging to all

Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be resolved by arbitration administered by the American
Arbitration Association (&#147;<B><I>AAA</I></B>&#148;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. AAA&#146;s Optional Rules for
Emergency Measures of Protection shall also apply to the proceedings. The arbitration will take
place in Dallas, Texas. All disputes shall be resolved by one (1)&nbsp;arbitrator. The arbitrator will
have the authority to award the same remedies, damages, and costs that a court could award
(including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, specific performance, and
damages). The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned award explaining the decision, the reasons for the
decision, and any damages awarded. The arbitrator&#146;s decision will be final and binding. The
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. The arbitration proceedings, any record of the same, and the award shall be considered

recognize and agree that in the event of an actual or threatened breach of Section&nbsp;7 or 8 of this
Agreement, money damages would be inadequate and the Company would not have an adequate remedy at
law. Accordingly, the Company may at its option, in addition and supplementary to other rights and
remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief to enforce or prevent any actual or
threatened breach of Section&nbsp;7 or 8 (without posting a bond or other security). In addition,
Executive agrees that in the event a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds that
Executive violated Sections&nbsp;7 or 8, the time periods set forth in those Sections shall be tolled
until such breach or violation has been cured. Executive further agrees that the Company shall
have the right to offset the amount of any damages resulting from a breach by Executive of Sections
7 or 8 against any payments due Executive under this Agreement and/or the Severance Agreement. The
parties agree that if Executive is found to have breached Section&nbsp;7 or 8, he shall be required to
pay the Company&#146;s attorney&#146;s fees and costs incurred in prosecuting the violation.

any), and knowingly, voluntarily, and without duress, agrees to all of the terms set forth in this
