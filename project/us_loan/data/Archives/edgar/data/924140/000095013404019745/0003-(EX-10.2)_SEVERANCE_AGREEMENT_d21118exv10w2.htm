<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>SEVERANCE PROTECTION AGREEMENT</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT made as of December&nbsp;20, 2004, by and between Gadzooks, Inc. (the &#147;<B><I>Company</I></B>&#148;) and

into this Agreement as a condition to the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company and to provide
certain benefits to the Executive upon the termination of employment of the Executive under certain
conditions and upon termination of that certain Executive Employment Agreement by and between the
Company and the Executive, dated as of the date hereof (the &#147;<B><I>Employment Agreement</I></B>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in order to induce the Executive to accept a position with the Company, the Company
desires to enter into this Agreement and the Employment Agreement with the Executive to provide the
Executive with certain benefits in the event the Executive&#146;s employment is terminated under certain
conditions, including as a result of, or in connection with, a Change of Control (as defined
herein); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, by entering into this Agreement and the Employment Agreement, the Executive will
agree to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with the Company or solicit employees of
the Company following his termination of employment, and the Company will benefit from said
restrictions. Defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning
set forth in the Employment Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective agreements of the parties contained herein,
it is agreed as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination by Either Party</U>. Either Executive or the Company may terminate the
Employment Agreement for any reason upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days written notice (the &#147;<B><I>Notice Period</I></B>&#148;). If
Executive terminates the Employment Agreement pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1(a), the Company will pay
Executive all accrued but unpaid Base Salary and earned bonus amounts through the termination date,
if any (&#147;<B><I>Accrued Compensation</I></B>&#148;). If the Company terminates the Employment Agreement pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;1(a), the Company shall pay Executive: (1)&nbsp;his Accrued Compensation, and, if the
termination is for reasons other than &#147;Cause&#148;, &#147;Death&#148;, or &#147;Disability&#148;, as defined below, (2)&nbsp;an
additional severance payment equal to one year of Executive&#146;s Base Salary then in effect,
calculated from the date the Company gives written notice of termination to Executive (the
&#147;<B><I>Additional Severance Payment</I></B>&#148;). If the Company terminates the Employment Agreement pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;1(a), after the effective date of a confirmed plan of reorganization in the Company&#146;s
bankruptcy case, then the amount of the Additional Severance Payment will be multiplied by two (2).
Any Additional Severance Payment will be paid out in equal monthly installments during the
Non-Interference Period. In addition, if the Company terminates the

of such confirmed plan or as a result of any action in any related transaction. Specifically, and
