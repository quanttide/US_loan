          Sypris Solutions, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) to attract, retain and motivate
          experienced directors by providing compensation that is competitive with
          compensation offered to directors of other similarly-situated public
          corporations in the United States. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->

          <I>Initial Election Grants and Annual Grants of Stock Options.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company
          shall grant each Eligible Director a nonqualified stock option for the purchase
          of: (i) up to 10,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, $.01 par value
          (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;) at the time the Eligible Director is initially
          elected to serve on the Board (the &#147;Initial Election Grant&#148;); and (ii)
          up to 4,500 shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock at each annual
          stockholders&#146; meeting thereafter (the &#147;Annual Grant&#148;), so long as
          a Director is continuing to serve as a Director on the date of said annual
          stockholders&#146; meeting. In the event that an Eligible Director is initially
          elected to the Board at a time other than the date of the Company&#146;s annual
          stockholders&#146; meeting, he or she shall receive an Annual Grant at the
          subsequent annual stockholders&#146; meeting for a pro rated number of shares to
          be determined by multiplying 4,500 by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
          be the number of full months which have elapsed since the date of the
          Director&#146;s initial election and the next annual stockholders&#146; meeting
          and the denominator of which shall be 12. All such stock options shall be
          granted by the Company to the Eligible Directors pursuant to the Company&#146;s
          2004 Equity Plan (the &#147;Equity Plan&#148;).

          Eligible Directors is initially elected and on the date of each annual
          stockholders&#146; meeting; (ii) priced at the fair market value of the
          Company&#146;s common stock, as determined in accordance with the Equity Plan,
          on the respective date of grant; (iii) immediately exercisable
          by each of the Eligible Directors on the respective dates of grant; and (iv)
          subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Plan and any other terms and
          conditions which, in accordance with the Equity Plan, are specified in the
          applicable Stock Option Agreement entered into by and between the Company and
