Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

              On December 21, 2004 (the "Closing Date"), Dycom Industries, Inc.
("Dycom") entered into a Credit Agreement ("Agreement") with certain lenders
named therein, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent,
Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Suntrust Bank, Harris Trust and
Savings Bank, HSBC Bank USA and LaSalle Bank National Association, as
Documentation Agents and Wachovia Capital Markets LLC, as sole lead arranger and
sole bookrunner.

              The Agreement replaces Dycom's existing credit facility which was
due to expire in June 2005 (the "Prior Agreement"). The Prior Agreement was
terminated on December 21, 2004, at which time there were no outstanding
borrowings thereunder. Letters of credit issued thereunder were transferred to
the Agreement.

              The Agreement provides for a maximum borrowing of $300,000,000 and
terminates on December 21, 2009. This maximum borrowing may be reduced from time
to time in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The Agreement contains a
sublimit of $100,000,000 for the issuance of letters of credit. Amounts borrowed
under the Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time
until December 21, 2009.

              Borrowings under the Agreement bear interest, at Dycom's option,
at either (a) the bank's base rate, described in the Agreement as the higher of
the annual rate of the lead bank's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus
0.50%, or (b) LIBOR (a publicly published rate) plus, in either case, a spread
based upon Dycom's consolidated leverage ratio. Based on our current leverage
ratio, borrowings would be eligible for a spread of 0.0% for revolving
borrowings based on prime rate or the federal funds rate and 1.0% for revolving
borrowings based on LIBOR. Under the Agreement, Dycom agrees to pay a facility
fee, payable quarterly, at rates that range from 0.2% to 0.375% of the
unutilized commitments depending on Dycom's leverage ratio, provided that in the
event Dycom is utilizing less than one-third of the facility the fee will be
0.375% of the unutilized commitments. The payments under the Agreement are
guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of Dycom.

              The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on Dycom and
its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments,
distributions, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, sale-leaseback
transactions and transactions with affiliates. The Agreement contains financial
covenants which require the Company to (i) maintain a leverage ratio of not
greater than 2.75 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, (ii)
maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.75 to 1.00, as measured
at the end of each fiscal quarter and (iii) maintain consolidated tangible net
worth of not less than $200,000,000 plus (A) 50% of Dycom's consolidated net
income (if positive) from the Closing Date to the date of computation plus (B)
75% of Dycom's equity issuances made from the Closing Date to the date of
computation.

Item 1.02.    Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

              Effective December 21, 2004, Dycom's existing revolving credit
facility (the "Prior Agreement"), which provided for a maximum borrowing of
$200,000,000 and was due to expire in June 2005 was terminated. Following
termination, there were no outstanding borrowings and all outstanding letters of
credit thereunder were transferred to the Agreement, a description of which is
contained under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Dycom did not
incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the
termination of the Prior Agreement.

         WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to make such loans and other financial
accommodations to the Borrower on the terms and conditions contained herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    SECTION 1
                                   DEFINITIONS

Agent in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1.1-A.

         "Additional Credit Party" means each Person that becomes a Guarantor by
execution of a Joinder Agreement in accordance with Section 6.9.

<PAGE>

definition, a Person shall be deemed to be "controlled by" a Person if such
Person possesses, directly or indirectly, power either (a) to vote 10% or more

request, and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof. Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date or on any of the three (3)

         each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for
         the account of the Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent
         specified in Section 11.2, or at such office as the Administrative

upon request a summary report of the nature and extent of LOC Obligations then

         (c) Participations. Each Lender upon issuance of a Letter of Credit
shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a risk participation from the

obligations under such Letter of Credit (including each Existing Letter of
Credit) and shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary

same day funds on the day of notification by the Issuing Lender of an

obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be absolute

not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the
Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter
provided.

Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the

as provided herein or in the LOC Documents. If the Borrower shall fail to
reimburse the Issuing Lender as provided herein, the unreimbursed amount of such
drawing shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Percentage plus two percent (2%). Unless the Borrower shall
immediately notify the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent of its intent
to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing as provided in
subsection (e) hereof, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the
reimbursement obligations. The Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder
shall be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any
rights of set-off, counterclaim or defense of payment the Borrower may claim or
have against the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the
beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including
without limitation any defense based on any failure of the Borrower to receive
consideration or the legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability of the
Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Lenders of the
amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each Lender shall promptly pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in Dollars and in

Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period from the date of
such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the Issuing Lender in full at
a rate per annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of
drawing, the Federal Funds Rate and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate
Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation to make such payment to the Issuing Lender,
and the right of the Issuing Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and
unconditional, shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without
regard to the termination of this Credit Agreement or the Commitments hereunder,
the existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the Credit
Party Obligations hereunder and shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever.

         (e) Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which the Borrower
shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a Revolving Loan to
reimburse a drawing under a


                                       26
<PAGE>

Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that
a Revolving Loan has been requested or deemed requested in connection with a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan borrowing
comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans (each such borrowing, a
"Mandatory Borrowing") shall be immediately made (without giving effect to any
termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 8.2) pro rata based on each
Lender's respective Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to
any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 8.2) and the proceeds
thereof shall be paid directly to the Issuing Lender for application to the
respective LOC Obligations. Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make such
Revolving Loans immediately upon any such request or deemed request on account
of each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the
preceding sentence and on the same such date notwithstanding (i) the amount of
Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for borrowings of
Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions
specified in Section 4.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event
of Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed request for
Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.1(b), (v)
the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (vi) any reduction in the Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount after any such Letter of Credit may have been drawn
upon; provided, however, that in the event any such Mandatory Borrowing should
be less than the minimum amount for borrowings of Revolving Loans otherwise
provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for its own account an administrative fee of $500. In the event that any
Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required
above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code), then each such Lender hereby agrees that
it shall forthwith fund (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise
have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from the Borrower on or
after such date and prior to such purchase) its Participation Interests in the
outstanding LOC Obligations; provided, further, that in the event any Lender
shall fail to fund its Participation Interest on the day the Mandatory Borrowing
would otherwise have occurred, then the amount of such Lender's unfunded
Participation Interest therein shall bear interest payable by such Lender to the
Issuing Lender upon demand, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
Business Days of such date, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at a rate
equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

         (f) Modification, Extension. The issuance of any supplement,
modification, amendment, renewal, or extension to any Letter of Credit shall,
for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as the issuance of a
new Letter of Credit hereunder.

         (g) Uniform Customs and Practices. The Issuing Lender shall have the
Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits, as published as of the date of issue by the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "UCP"), in which case the UCP may be incorporated therein and
deemed in all respects to be a part thereof.

         (h) Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict between
this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of credit
application), this Credit Agreement shall control.

         2.3 Swingline Loan Subfacility.

         (a) Swingline Commitment. During the Commitment Period, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender, in its individual capacity,
agrees to make certain revolving credit loans to the Borrower (each a "Swingline
Loan" and, collectively, the "Swingline Loans") for the purposes hereinafter set
forth; provided, however, (i) the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans
outstanding at any time shall not exceed FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ($15,000,000)
(the "Swingline Committed Amount"), and (ii) the Total Outstandings at any time
shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. Swingline Loans
hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

         (b) Swingline Loan Borrowings.

              (i) Notice of Borrowing and Disbursement. The Swingline Lender
         will make Swingline Loans available to the Borrower on any Business Day
         upon request made by the Borrower not later than 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte,
         North Carolina time) on such Business Day. A notice of request for
         Swingline Loan borrowing shall be made in the form of Schedule
         2.1(b)(i) with appropriate modifications. Swingline Loan borrowings
         hereunder shall be made in minimum amounts of $100,000 and in integral
         amounts of $100,000 in excess thereof.

              (ii) Repayment of Swingline Loans. Each Swingline Loan borrowing
         shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Swingline Lender
         may, at any time, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent, demand repayment of its
         Swingline Loans by way of a Revolving Loan borrowing, in which case the
         Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan borrowing
         comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans in the amount of such
         Swingline Loans; provided, however, that, in the following
         circumstances, any such demand shall also be deemed to have been given
         one Business Day prior to each of (i) the Maturity Date, (ii) the
         occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 8.1(e), (iii)
         upon acceleration of the Credit Party Obligations hereunder, whether on
         account of an Event of Default described in Section 8.1(e) or any other
         Event of Default, and (iv) the exercise of remedies in accordance with
         the provisions of Section 8.2 hereof (each such Revolving Loan
         borrowing made on account of any such deemed request therefore as
         provided herein being hereinafter referred to as "Mandatory
         Borrowing"). Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make such
         Revolving Loans promptly upon any such request or deemed request on
         account of each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner
         specified in the preceding sentence and on the same such date
         notwithstanding (I) the amount of Mandatory Borrowing may not comply
         with the minimum amount for borrowings of Revolving Loans otherwise
         required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions specified in Section
         4.2 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default or an Event of Default
         then exists, (IV) failure of any such request or deemed request for
         Revolving Loans to be made by the time otherwise required in Section
         2.1(b)(i), (V) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (VI) any
         reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount or termination of the
         Revolving Commitments immediately prior to such Mandatory



                                       28
<PAGE>

         Borrowing or contemporaneously therewith. In the event that any
         Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise
         required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the
         commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code), then each
         Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date
         the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for
         any payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior
         to such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such participations in the
         outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause each such
         Lender to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon its
         respective Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to
         any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 8.2), provided
         that (A) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the
         account of the Swingline Lender until the date as of which the
         respective participation is purchased, and (B) at the time any purchase
         of participations pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the
         purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Swingline Lender
         interest on the principal amount of such participation purchased for
         each day from and including the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing
         would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for
         such participation, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
         Business Days of the date of the Mandatory Borrowing, the Federal Funds
         Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

         (c) Interest on Swingline Loans. Subject to the provisions of Section
3.9, Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage for Revolving Loans that are
Alternate Base Rate Loans. Interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date.

         (d) Swingline Note. If requested by the Swingline Lender, the Swingline
Loans shall be evidenced by a duly executed Swingline Note of the Borrower to
the Swingline Lender substantially in the form of Schedule 2.3(d).


                                    SECTION 3
                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

         3.1 Default Rate.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall, upon the election of the Required Lenders (except with respect to an
Event of Default occurring under Section 8.1(e), in which case such interest
rate increase shall be immediate), bear interest, payable on demand, at a per
annum rate 2% greater than the interest rate which would otherwise be applicable
(or if no rate is applicable, whether in respect of interest, fees or other
amounts, then 2% greater than the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
Percentage).



                                       29
<PAGE>

         3.2 Extension and Conversion.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
expressly provided otherwise in this Credit Agreement, LIBOR Rate Loans may be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans only on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans may be extended, and Alternate
Base Rate Loans may be converted into LIBOR Rate Loans, only if the conditions
in Section 4.2 have been satisfied and (iii) Loans extended as, or converted
into, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition of
"Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum amounts
as provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii). Any request for extension or conversion of a
LIBOR Rate Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed
to be a request for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension or
conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of
Extension/Conversion (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M. on the Business Day of, in the case of
the conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan into a Alternate Base Rate Loan, and on the
third Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a LIBOR Rate Loan
as, or conversion of a Alternate Base Rate Loan into, a LIBOR Rate Loan, the
date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying (A) the date of the
proposed extension or conversion, (B) the Loans to be so extended or converted,
(C) the types of Loans into which such Loans are to be converted and, if
appropriate, (D) the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each
request for extension or conversion shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters specified in Section
4.2. In the event the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any
LIBOR Rate Loan in accordance with this Section 3.2, or any such conversion or
extension is not permitted or required by this Section 3.2, then such LIBOR Rate
Loan shall be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each
Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed extension or
conversion affecting any Loan.

         3.3 Voluntary Repayments and Mandatory Prepayments.

         (a) Voluntary Repayments. Revolving Loans may be repaid in whole or in
part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) LIBOR Rate Loans may be
repaid only upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, and Alternate Base Rate Loans may be repaid only upon at
least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice to the Administrative Agent,
(ii) repayments of LIBOR Rate Loans must be accompanied by payment of any
amounts owing under Section 3.12, and (iii) partial repayments shall be in
minimum principal amount of $5,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000
in excess thereof.

         (b) Mandatory Prepayments. If at any time, the Total Outstandings at
such time shall exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, the Borrower
shall immediately make a payment on the Loans in an amount sufficient to
eliminate such excess.

         (c) Application. Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, voluntary
repayments and mandatory prepayments made hereunder shall be applied first to
Alternate Base Rate Loans,



                                       30
<PAGE>

then to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities, and then
(after all Revolving Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral account in
respect of LOC Obligations. Amounts repaid hereunder may be reborrowed in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

         3.4 Termination and Reduction of Commitments

         (a) Voluntary Reductions. The unused portion of the Aggregate Revolving
Committed Amount may be terminated or permanently reduced by the Borrower in
whole or in part upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent; provided that (i) after giving effect to any voluntary
reduction, the Total Outstandings at such time shall not exceed the Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced, and (ii) partial reductions shall be in
minimum principal amounts of $5,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000
in excess thereof.

         (b) Maturity Date. The Revolving Commitment, the Swingline Commitment
and the LOC Commitment shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

         3.5 Fees.

         (a) Commitment Fee. In consideration of the Commitments, the Borrower
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders
holding Commitments a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") in an amount equal
to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the average daily unused amount of the
Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. For purposes of computation of the
Commitment Fee, LOC Obligations shall be considered usage of the Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount but Swingline Loans shall not be considered usage of
the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. The Commitment Fee shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on the 15th day following the last day of each calendar
quarter for the prior calendar quarter.

         (b) Letter of Credit Fees. In consideration of the LOC Commitments, the
Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender a fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee")
equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the average daily maximum amount
available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit from the date of issuance to
the date of expiration. In addition to such Letter of Credit Fee, the Issuing
Lender may charge, and retain for its own account without sharing by the other
Lenders, an additional fronting fee (the "Fronting Fee") of one-eighth of one
percent (0.125%) per annum on the average daily maximum amount available to be
drawn under each such Letter of Credit issued by it. The Fronting Fee shall be
payable on the 15th day following the end of the calendar quarter during which a
Letter of Credit has been issued. The Issuing Lender shall promptly pay over to
the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders (including the
Issuing Lender) the Letter of Credit Fee. The Letter of Credit Fee shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day following the last day of each
calendar quarter for the prior calendar quarter.

         (c) Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the Letter of Credit Fees
payable pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing
Lender for its own account without sharing by the other Lenders the reasonable
and customary charges from time to time of the


                                       31
<PAGE>

Issuing Lender with respect to the amendment, transfer, administration,
cancellation and conversion of, and drawings under, such Letters of Credit
(collectively, the "Issuing Lender Fees").

         (d) Administrative Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent the annual administrative fee as described in the Fee
Letter.

         3.6 Computation of Interest and Fees.

         (a) Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate Base Rate
Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365
days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days elapsed. All other fees,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent
shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each
determination of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof.
Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the
Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the
day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective. The
Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change.

         (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Credit Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent
in determining any interest rate.

         (c) It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to conform
to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time
in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Credit Parties are hereby
limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all
such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited
to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any Credit Party Obligations),
shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under
this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum
nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible
construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest
would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such
construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such
interest shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount
permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any
amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value
which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which
would apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurous amount,
an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall,
without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on
the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the
other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been
excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand
payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit



                                       32
<PAGE>

Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not
otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to
charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All
interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or
extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such
indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by
applicable law.

         3.7 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.

         (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction of the
Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment
Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment under this Credit Agreement or any Note
shall be applied (i) first, to any Fees then due and owing, (ii) second, to
interest then due and owing in respect of the Notes of the Borrower and (iii)
third, to principal then due and owing hereunder and under the Notes of the
Borrower. Each payment on account of the Commitment Fees or the Letter of Credit
Fees shall be made pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts due and
owing. Each payment (other than voluntary repayments and mandatory prepayments)
by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans
shall be made pro rata according to the respective amounts due and owing
hereunder. Each voluntary repayment and mandatory prepayment on account of
principal of the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.3. All
payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of
principal, interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or
counterclaim (except as provided in Section 3.13(b)) and shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the Administrative
Agent's office specified in Section 11.2 in Dollars and in immediately available
funds not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date when due. The Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto promptly upon
receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments
on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business
Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and,
with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the
then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan
becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such
extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which
event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

         (b) Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or
received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit
Party Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit
Documents shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

              FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
         expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of
         the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the
         Lenders under the Credit Documents;



                                       33
<PAGE>

              SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent;

              THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
         expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of
         each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the
         Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

              FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
         consisting of accrued fees and interest and including with respect to
         any Hedging Agreement between any Credit Party and any Hedging
         Agreement Provider, any fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments
         due under such Hedging Agreement and any interest accrued thereon;

              FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the
         Credit Party Obligations including, without limitation, the payment or
         cash collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations and payment
         of the outstanding principal amount arising under any Hedging Agreement
         between any Credit Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender,
         to the extent such Hedging Agreement is permitted by Section 7.1(e),
         any breakage, termination or other payments due under such Hedging
         Agreement and any interest accrued thereon;

              SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other obligations
         which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or
         otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH"
         above; and

              SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be
         lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

         In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in
         the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to
         the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an
         amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the
         then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to
         the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts
         available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH"
         and "SIXTH" above and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available
         for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to
         the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such
         amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral
         account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from
         time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B)
         then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other
         obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above
         in the manner provided in this Section 3.7. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing terms of this Section 3.7, only payments under the Guaranty
         with respect to Hedging Agreements with a Hedging Agreement Provider
         shall be applied to obligations under any Hedging Agreement.

         3.8 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

         (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be made by such Lender (which notice
shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make the
proceeds of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such proceeds available to the
Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance
upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact
made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be
able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does
not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and
the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover
from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding
amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the
date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per
annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the
applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender
at the Federal Funds Rate.

         (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any payment is due from it hereunder
(which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that the Borrower does not intend
to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has
made such payment when due, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon
such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to each Lender on
such payment date an amount equal to the portion of such assumed payment to
which such Lender is entitled hereunder, and if the Borrower has not in fact
made such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand,
repay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to such Lender. If
such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent on a date after the date such
amount was made available to such Lender, such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect of each day
from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent at a
per annum rate equal to, if repaid to the Administrative Agent within two (2)
days from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent,
the Federal Funds Rate and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base
Rate.

         (c) A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to the Borrower
or any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this Section 3.8 shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

         3.9 Inability to Determine Interest Rate.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if (i)
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do
not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period, or (ii) the Required


                                       35
<PAGE>

Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the
Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR Tranche during such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such
determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower, and the Lenders at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period. Unless the
Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such
telephone notice that it wishes to rescind or modify its request regarding such
LIBOR Rate Loans, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans
shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans and any Loans that were requested to
be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall remain as or be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until any such notice has been
withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as,
continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so
affected.

         3.10 Illegality.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender shall
make it unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make or maintain
LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement or to obtain in the
interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the funds with
which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such Lender
hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such shall
forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall give notice that the
condition or situation which gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist,
and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall
be converted on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans or within
such earlier period as required by law to Alternate Base Rate Loans. The
Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay any Lender, upon its demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct
costs (but not including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender
including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate
Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 3.10 submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to
the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender
agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its
LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be
payable pursuant to this Section 3.10; provided, however, that such efforts
shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal
or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be
material.

         3.11 Requirements of Law.

         (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in
the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:



                                       36
<PAGE>

              (i) shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever
         with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of
         taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for
         changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);

              (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
         deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
         deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans
         or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
         any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the
         determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or

              (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or the Letters of Credit or to reduce any
amount receivable hereunder or under any Note (other than costs or reductions
relating to taxes which shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.13 hereof),
then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its
demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such
additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such Lender reasonably deems
to be material as determined by such Lender with respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans
or Letters of Credit. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 3.11 submitted by such Lender, through the
Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including
reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to
avoid or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to
this paragraph of this Section 3.11; provided, however, that such efforts shall
not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or
regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material.

         (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption of
or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank
or Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's
capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such
corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably
deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material, then from time to
time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall
pay to such Lender such additional amount as shall be certified by such Lender
as being required to compensate it for such reduction. Such a certificate as to
any additional amounts payable under this Section 3.11 submitted by a Lender
(which certificate shall include a description of the basis for the
computation), through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.



                                       37
<PAGE>

         (c) The agreements in this Section 3.11 shall survive the termination
of this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

         3.12 Indemnity.

         The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold such
Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment of the
principal amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in accordance with
the terms hereof, (b) default by the Borrower in accepting a borrowing after the
Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, (c) default by
the Borrower in making any repayment after the Borrower has given a notice in
accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a
repayment or prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is
not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, in each case
including, but not limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or
fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to
maintain its Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 3.12 submitted by any Lender, through the
Administrative Agent, to the Borrower (which certificate must be delivered to
the Administrative Agent within thirty (30) days following such default,
repayment, prepayment or conversion) shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. The agreements in this Section 3.12 shall survive termination of
this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

         3.13 Taxes.

         (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note will
be, except to the extent required by law and except as provided in Section
3.13(b), made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other
charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any Governmental
Authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein
with respect to such payments (but excluding (i) any tax imposed on or measured
by the net income or profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal
office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any subdivision
thereof or therein, (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed by the United States
or any similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction in which the Borrower is
located and (iii) any taxes that would not have been imposed but for a
connection between a Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such tax other than a
connection arising solely from entering into this Credit Agreement or any other
Credit Documents) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with
respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as "Taxes"). If any
Taxes are required by law to be withheld or deducted by the Borrower from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note, (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due
under this Credit Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction
for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for
herein or in such Note, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions or
withholdings and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with


                                       38
<PAGE>

applicable law. The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as
practicable after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to
applicable law certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and required
by law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower. If liability
for Taxes is asserted against a Lender, the Lender shall provide notice to the
Borrower of such liability, and the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless
such Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount
of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender. A Lender's failure to
provide notice to the Borrower shall not relieve the Borrower of any of its
obligations under the preceding sentence, however, notwithstanding the
foregoing, where notice is not given within 120 days after the Lender receives
written notice of the assertion of Taxes and the Borrower does not otherwise
have notice of such assertion, no indemnification shall be required for
penalties, additions to Taxes, expenses and interest accruing on such Taxes from
the date 120 days after the receipt by the Lender of written notice of the
assertion of such Taxes until thirty (30) days after the date such notice was
actually received by the Borrower. Each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Borrower in seeking a refund of any such Tax payment, which,
in the opinion of the independent certified accountants to the Borrower, has not
been correctly or legally asserted. In the event that an administrative or
judicial proceeding is commenced involving any Lender which, if determined
adversely to it, would result in the payment of Taxes, such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower and shall cooperate with and assist the Borrower to
reduce or recover amounts with respect to such Taxes.

         (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of
a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Credit
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.6 (unless the respective Lender was already a
Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date
of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) if the Lender is a "bank"
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, two accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI (or successor forms) (or, in the case of a partnership, an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8IMY with appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8
of its Partners attached) certifying such Lender's entitlement to a complete
exemption from United States federal withholding tax with respect to payments to
be made under this Credit Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is
not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI as set forth in clause (i) above,
or (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.13 (any such
certificate, a "3.13 Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) (or,
in the case of a partnership, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY with
appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8 of its Partners attached)
certifying such Lender's entitlement to an exemption from United States federal
withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this
Credit Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that it
will deliver upon the Borrower's request updated versions of the foregoing, as
applicable, whenever the previous certification has become obsolete or
inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms as may be
required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States federal withholding tax
with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement and any Note.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary



                                       39
<PAGE>

contained in Section 3.13(a), but subject to the immediately succeeding
sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do
so by law, to deduct or withhold Taxes imposed by the United States (or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest,
fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which is
not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code) for United States federal income tax purposes to the extent that such
Lender has not provided to the Borrower United States Internal Revenue Service
Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and
(y) the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.13(a) hereof to
indemnify or gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of Taxes
imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Borrower
the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 3.13(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than
interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such
Forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or
elsewhere in this Section 3.13, the Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts
and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 3.13(a) (without
regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or
withholding) in respect of any Taxes deducted or withheld by it as described in
the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes after the Closing
Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or
withholding of Taxes; provided, however, that if a Lender is able to avoid or
reduce such Taxes by complying with applicable information reporting,
certification or identification requirements, such Lender must comply with such
requirements to obtain the benefits of this sentence.

         (c) Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable
efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to
minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section
3.13; provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on
such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by
such Lender in its sole discretion to be material.

         (d) If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant to this Section
3.13 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax liabilities on account of such
payment; provided that such Lender shall have no obligation to use such
reasonable efforts if either (i) it is in an excess foreign tax credit position
or (ii) it believes in good faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a
refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it. In the event that
such Lender receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the
Borrower an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net
tax benefit obtained by such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower.
In the event that no refund or credit is obtained with respect to the Borrower's
payments to such Lender pursuant to this Section 3.13, then such Lender shall
upon request provide a certification that such Lender has not received a refund
or credit for such payments. Nothing contained in this Section 3.13 shall
require a Lender to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the
amount of any tax benefit or any other amount or the basis of its determination
referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 3.13 to the
Borrower or any other party.



                                       40
<PAGE>

         (e) The agreements in this Section 3.13 shall survive the termination
of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

         3.14 Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.

         (a) In addition to its other obligations under Section 2.2, the
Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and hold the Issuing Lender
harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages,
losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that
the Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or
indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit, except to the extent
resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the
Issuing Lender or (ii) the failure of the Issuing Lender to honor a drawing
under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or
wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or
governmental authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called "Government
Acts").

         (b) As between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall
assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof. The Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i) the
form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any
or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii)
the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon
a Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or
otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of
technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document required in order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the
proceeds thereof; and (vii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the
control of the Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, any Government
Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the
Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

         (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing
Lender, under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related
certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing
Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower. It is the intention of the
parties that this Credit Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and
indemnify the Issuing Lender against any and all risks involved in the issuance
of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower,
including, without limitation, any and all risks of the acts or omissions,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any Government Authority. The Issuing Lender
shall not, in any way, be liable for any failure by the Issuing Lender or anyone
else to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any Government
Acts or any other cause beyond the control of the Issuing Lender.



                                       41
<PAGE>

         (d) Nothing in this Section 3.14 is intended to limit the reimbursement
obligation of the Borrower contained in Section 2.2 hereof. The obligations of
the Borrower under this Section 3.14 shall survive the termination of this
Credit Agreement. No act or omissions of any current or prior beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Issuing
Lender to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Credit Agreement.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
3.14, the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify any Issuing Lender in
respect of any liability incurred by such Issuing Lender arising out of the
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender, as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

         3.15 Replacement of Lenders; Other Limitations.

         (a) If any Lender shall petition the Borrower for any increased cost or
amounts under Section 3.10 or 3.11(a) or shall notify the Borrower that its
obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans has been suspended under Section
3.11(b) (any such Lender being hereinafter referred to as a "Replaced Lender"),
then the Borrower may, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, at the Borrower's expense, within sixty (60) days of
receipt of such petition or notice and upon at least five (5) Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent and such Replaced Lender, designate a
replacement lender (a "Replacement Lender") acceptable to the Administrative
Agent in its reasonable discretion (except if the Replacement Lender is an
existing Lender), to which such Replaced Lender shall, subject to its receipt
(unless a later date for the remittance thereof shall be agreed upon by the
Borrower and the Replaced Lender) of all amounts owed to such Replaced Lender
under Section 3.11(a) or 3.11(b), assign all (but not less than all) of its
rights, obligations, Loans and Commitment hereunder; provided that (x) all
amounts owed to such Replaced Lender by the Borrower (except liabilities which
by the terms hereof survive the payment in full of the Loans and termination of
this Credit Agreement) shall be paid in full as of the date of such assignment
and (y) on the date of such assignment, such Replacement Lender shall have paid
such Replaced Lender an amount equal to the greater of the (i) par value or (ii)
fair market value of the outstanding principal amount of such Replaced Lender's
Loans and/or Commitments hereunder, as the case may be. Upon any assignment by
any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.15 becoming effective, the Replacement
Lender shall thereupon be deemed to be a "Lender" for all purposes of this
Credit Agreement and such Replaced Lender shall thereupon cease to be a "Lender"
for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and shall have no further rights or
obligations hereunder (other than pursuant to Sections 3.10, 3.11(a) and 3.11(b)
while such Replaced Lender was a Lender).

         (b) If any Lender shall petition the Borrower for any increased cost or
amounts under Section 3.11 more than ninety (90) days after such Lender had
knowledge of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such increased costs or
amounts, the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse such Lender for
amounts incurred prior to the date on which the Borrower receives such petition
for increased costs or amounts (provided that if the event giving rise to the
increased costs or amounts is retroactive, then the ninety (90) day period
referenced above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect).

                                    SECTION 5

         5.2 No Material Adverse Change.

         Since July 31, 2004, there has been no development or event which has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.3 Organization; Existence.

         Each Credit Party (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the
corporate or other necessary power and authority, and the legal right to own and
operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct
the business in which it is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a
foreign entity and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where
its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.4 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.

         Each Credit Party has the corporate or other necessary power and
authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Credit
Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate or other
action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party. No consent or authorization of, filing with,
notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person is required in connection with acceptance of extensions of credit
by the Borrower or the making of the guaranties hereunder or with the execution,
delivery or performance of any Credit Documents by the Credit Parties (other
than those which have been obtained) or with the validity or enforceability of
any Credit Document against the Credit Parties. Each Credit Document to which it
is a party constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each Credit
Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles.

         5.5 Conflict.

         The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds of the Loans will not (a)
violate any Requirement of Law applicable to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (except those as to which waivers or consents have been obtained),
(b) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under (i) the
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of such
Person, (ii) any material indenture, material agreement or other material
instrument to which such Person is a party or by which any of its properties may
be bound or (iii) any approval of any Governmental Authority relating to such
Person, or (c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of
Law.



                                       47
<PAGE>

         5.6 No Material Litigation.

         No claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Credit Parties, threatened by or against any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any of their respective properties which (a) relates to
the Credit Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or (b) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.7 No Default.

         No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         5.8 Taxes.

         Each of the Credit Parties and its Subsidiaries has filed, or caused to
be filed, all tax returns (federal, state, local and foreign) required to be
filed and paid (a) all amounts of taxes shown thereon to be due (including
interest and penalties) and (b) all other taxes, fees, assessments and other
governmental charges (including mortgage recording taxes, documentary stamp
taxes and intangibles taxes) owing by it, except for such taxes (i) which are
not yet delinquent or (ii) that are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings, and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in
accordance with GAAP. Neither any of the Credit Parties nor any of its
Subsidiaries are aware as of the Closing Date of any proposed tax assessments
against it or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.9 ERISA.

         Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has
occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code, except to the extent that any such occurrence or failure to comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred resulting in any liability
that has remained underfunded, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefits under each
Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did
not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount which, as determined in
accordance with GAAP, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity is currently
subject to any liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.10 Governmental Regulations, Etc.

         (a) No part of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder will be used,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin
stock" within the meaning of Regulation U, or for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying or trading in any securities. No Indebtedness being reduced or retired
out of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder was or will be incurred for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of
Regulation U or any "margin security" within the meaning of Regulation T.
"Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not constitute more than
25% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries. Neither the execution and delivery hereof by the Borrower, nor the
performance by it of any of the transactions contemplated by this Credit
Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect use of the
proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
regulations issued pursuant thereto, or Regulation T, U or X.

         (b) None of the Credit Parties is (i) an "investment company"
registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and is not controlled by such a company, or (ii) a "holding
company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a "holding company", within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         5.11 Subsidiaries.

         5.12 Use of Proceeds.

         The Extensions of Credit will be used solely (a) to refinance certain
existing Indebtedness, including the Existing Credit Agreement, (b) to provide
general working capital, (c) for Permitted Acquisitions and (d) for other
general corporate purposes.

         5.13 Compliance with Laws; Contractual Obligations.

         Each Credit Party and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Credit Parties is in default under or with
respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.14 Accuracy and Completeness of Information.

         All factual information heretofore, contemporaneously or hereafter
furnished by or on behalf of the Credit Parties in writing to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender for purposes of or in connection with this Credit Agreement
or any other Credit Document, or any transaction



                                       49

respects as of the date stated therein and not incomplete by omitting to state

expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect which fact has not been set forth
herein, in the financial statements of the Credit Parties furnished to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, or in any certificate, opinion or other
written statement made or furnished by the Credit Parties to the Administrative
Agent and/or the Lenders.

         5.15 Environmental Matters.

         (a) Except where such violation or liability could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and to the best knowledge of the
Credit Parties, the facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by any
of the Credit Parties and the Subsidiaries (the "Properties") do not contain any
Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or concentrations which (i)
constitute a violation of, or (ii) have resulted in liability under, any
Environmental Law.

         (b) Except where such violation could not reasonably be expected to

Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the business operated by any
of the Credit Parties (the "Business").

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth on Schedule
5.15, none of the Credit Parties or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of, or otherwise become aware of, any violation, alleged

applicable Environmental Law.

         (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.15, no judicial proceeding or
governmental or administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of any
Credit Party, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which any of the Credit
Parties is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or the
Business, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders,
administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial
directives outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the
Properties or the Business.

<PAGE>

         (f) Except where such violation or liability could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth on Schedule
5.15, there has been no release or threat of release of Materials of
Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or arising from or related to

manner requiring remediation under Environmental Laws.

         5.16 Solvency.

going concern basis, exceeds all probable liabilities, including those to be
incurred pursuant to this Credit Agreement. None of the Credit Parties (a) has
unreasonably small capital in relation to the business in which it is or

States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any
enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto or (c) the Patriot Act

person described in section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order or (ii) to the best of
its knowledge, engages in any dealings or transactions, or is otherwise

Person or a Sanctioned Country.

                                    SECTION 6
                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         The Credit Parties covenant and agree that on the Closing Date, and so

Lenders shall, by written notice to the Borrower take any of the following

                                    SECTION 9
                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

         9.1 Appointment.

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Wachovia as the
Administrative Agent of such Lender under this Credit Agreement, and each such
Lender irrevocably authorizes Wachovia, as the Administrative Agent for such
Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Credit
Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Credit Agreement,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Credit
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Credit Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

         9.2 Delegation of Duties.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Credit Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled
to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may appoint one of its
affiliates as its agent to perform the functions of the Administrative Agent
hereunder relating to the advancing



                                       65
<PAGE>

of funds to the Borrower and distribution of funds to the Lenders and to perform
such other related functions of the Administrative Agent hereunder as are
reasonably incidental to such functions.

         9.3 Exculpatory Provisions.

         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Credit Agreement (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any Credit Party or any officer thereof contained in this Credit Agreement or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Credit Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Credit Documents or for any failure
of any Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance by any Credit Party
of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit Agreement,
or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Credit Party.

         9.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes unless (a) a written notice of assignment, negotiation
or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent and (b)
the Administrative Agent shall have received the written agreement of such
assignee to be bound hereby as fully and to the same extent as if such assignee
were an original Lender party hereto, in each case in form satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Credit Agreement unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under any of the Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders or all of the Lenders, as may be required under this Credit Agreement,
and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.



                                       66
<PAGE>

         9.5 Notice of Default.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders except to the extent that
this Credit Agreement expressly requires that such action be taken, or not
taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders,
or all of the Lenders, as the case may be.

         9.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and made its own decision
to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Credit Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may
come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         9.7 Indemnification.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity
hereunder (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit Parties and without
limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the



                                       67
<PAGE>

date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 9.7, from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which
may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the
payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit
Document or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from
the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable
judgment. The agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of
this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

         9.8 Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.

         The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as
though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit
Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

         9.9 Successor Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty
(30) days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. If the Administrative
Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement and the
other Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the
Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be
approved by the Borrower (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers
and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent"
shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval,
and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to
this Credit Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Section 9.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement.

         9.10 Other Agents, Arrangers and Managers.

         None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the front page or
signature pages of this Credit Agreement as "Syndication Agent," "Lead Arranger"
or "Book Manager" shall have



                                       68
<PAGE>

any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Credit Agreement other than, in the case of the Syndication Agent, those
applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not
relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified
in deciding to enter into this Credit Agreement or in taking or not taking
action hereunder.


                                   SECTION 10
                                    GUARANTY

         10.1 The Guaranty.

         In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and
any Hedging Agreement Provider to enter into any Hedging Agreement and to extend
credit hereunder and thereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be
received by the Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder and any
Hedging Agreement, each of the Guarantors hereby agrees with the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders as follows: the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably jointly and severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely
as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, of any and all indebtedness of the Borrower owed to
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Hedging Agreement Providers. If
any or all of the indebtedness becomes due and payable hereunder or under any
Hedging Agreement with a Hedging Agreement Provider, each Guarantor
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders, the Hedging Agreement Providers, or order, or demand, together with
any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders or the Hedging Agreement Providers in collecting any of the
Credit Party Obligations. The word "indebtedness" is used in this Article in its
most comprehensive sense and includes any and all advances, debts, obligations
and liabilities of the Borrower and the Guarantors, including specifically all
Credit Party Obligations, arising in connection with this Credit Agreement, the
other Credit Documents or Hedging Agreement with a Hedging Agreement Provider,
in each case, heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such indebtedness is
from time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter increased or incurred,
whether the Borrower and the Guarantors may be liable individually or jointly
with others, whether or not recovery upon such indebtedness may be or hereafter
become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether or not such
indebtedness may be or hereafter become otherwise enforceable.

         Each Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby
confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the
obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance for the purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance
Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or
state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the
obligations of each Guarantor



                                       69
<PAGE>

under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will
result in the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting
a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

         10.2 Bankruptcy.

         Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders and any Hedging Agreement Provider
whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the
events specified in Section 8.1(e), and unconditionally promises to pay such
Credit Party Obligations to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Lenders and to any such Hedging Agreement Provider, or order, on demand, in
lawful money of the United States. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to
the extent that the Borrower or a Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer
of an interest in any property to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
Hedging Agreement Provider, which payment or transfer or any part thereof is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, or
otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be repaid to the Borrower or a
Guarantor, the estate of the Borrower or a Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the
obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.

         10.3 Nature of Liability.

         The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent
of any security for or other guaranty of the Credit Party Obligations of the
Borrower whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any
other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or
impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by
any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such
other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase,
decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Hedging Agreement Provider on the
Credit Party Obligations that the Administrative Agent, such Lenders or such
Hedging Agreement Provider repay the Borrower pursuant to court order in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief
proceeding, and each of the Guarantors waives any right to the deferral or
modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.

         10.4 Independent Obligation.

         The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of any other Guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not
action is brought against any other Guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not
any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.



                                       70
<PAGE>

         10.5 Authorization.

         Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and each Hedging Agreement Provider without notice or demand (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or
impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise,
extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or
otherwise change the terms of the Credit Party Obligations or any part thereof
in accordance with this Credit Agreement and any Hedging Agreement, as
applicable, including any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon,
(b) take and hold security from any Guarantor or any other party for the payment
of this Guaranty or the Credit Party Obligations and exchange, enforce waive and
release any such security, (c) apply such security and direct the order or
manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their
discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute any one or more
endorsers, Guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors.

         10.6 Reliance.

         It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any
Hedging Agreement Providers to inquire into the capacity or powers of the
Borrower or the officers, directors, members, partners or agents acting or
purporting to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in
reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed
hereunder.

         10.7 Waiver.

         (a) Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Hedging Agreement Provider to (i)
proceed against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other party, (ii)
proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other
Guarantor or any other party, or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the
Administrative Agent's, any Lender's or any Hedging Agreement Provider's power
whatsoever. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of
any defense of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other party other than
payment in full of the Credit Party Obligations, including without limitation
any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other
Guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Credit Party
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Credit Party
Obligations. The Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may, at their
election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any
such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by
applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent
and any Lender may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any
security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any
Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Credit Party Obligations have been
paid in full. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such
election by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, even though such
election operates to impair or extinguish any right of



                                       71
<PAGE>

reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against
the Borrower or any other party or any security.

         (b) Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for
performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of
nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of
this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
Additional Credit Party Obligations. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility
for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and
assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Credit Party Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which
such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor
of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.

         (c) Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise any
rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of
this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders or the Hedging Agreement
Provider against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower owing to the Lenders or such Hedging Agreement
Provider (collectively, the "Other Parties") and all contractual, statutory or
common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other
Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until
such time as the Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in full, no
Credit Document or Hedging Agreement with a Hedging Agreement Provider remains
in effect and the Commitments have been terminated. Each of the Guarantors
hereby further agrees not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy
which the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Hedging Agreement Provider
now have or may hereafter have against any Other Party, any endorser or any
other guarantor of all or any part of the Credit Party Obligations of the
Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or
collateral given to or for the benefit of the Lenders and/or the Hedging
Agreement Providers to secure payment of the Credit Party Obligations of the
Borrower until such time as the Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in
full, no Credit Document or Hedging Agreement with a Hedging Agreement Provider
remains in effect and the Commitments have been terminated.

         10.8 Limitation on Enforcement.

         The Lenders and the Hedging Agreement Providers agree that this
Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting
upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (only with respect to obligations
under the applicable Hedging Agreement entered into with such Hedging Agreement
Provider) and that no Lender or Hedging Agreement Provider shall have any right
individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood
and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders under the terms of this Credit Agreement
and for the benefit of any Hedging Agreement Provider under any Hedging
Agreement provided by such Hedging Agreement Provider. The Lenders and the
Hedging Agreement Providers further agree that this Guaranty may not be enforced
against any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Guarantors.

         10.9 Confirmation of Payment.

         The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after
payment of the Credit Party Obligations which are the subject of this Guaranty
and termination of the Commitments relating thereto, confirm to the Borrower,
the Guarantors or any other Person that the Credit Party Obligations have been
paid in full and the Commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the
provisions of Section 10.2.


                                   SECTION 11
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1 Amendments and Waivers.

         Neither this Credit Agreement, nor any of the other Credit Documents,
nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified
except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.1. The Required
Lenders may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower
written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit
Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Credit Agreement or
the other Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders
or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and
conditions as the Required Lenders may specify in such instrument, any of the
requirements of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any
Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no
such waiver and no such amendment, waiver, supplement, modification or release
shall:

              (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity
         of any Loan or Note, or reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee
         payable hereunder (except in connection with a waiver of interest at
         the increased post-default rate) or extend the scheduled date of any
         payment thereof or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of
         any Lender's Commitment, in each case without the written consent of
         each Lender directly affected thereby; or

              (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 11.1
         or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
         Lenders, without the written consent of all the Lenders; or

              (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 9
         without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent; or

              (iv) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from
         their obligations under the Guaranty (excluding for purposes hereof the
         release of a Guarantor by a sale, transfer, disposition or otherwise to
         the extent permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 7.4) without the
         written consent of all of the Lenders; or



                                       73
<PAGE>

              (v) amend, modify or waive the Lender approval requirements
         of any provision of the Credit Documents which at such time requires
         the consent, approval or request of the Required Lenders or all
         Lenders, as the case may be, without the written consent of the
         Required Lenders or of all of the Lenders, as the case may be; or

              (vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of the Credit
         Documents affecting the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent,
         the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender under any Credit Document
         without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Lender and/or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, in addition to the
         Lenders required hereinabove to take such action; or

              (vii) amend or modify the definition of Credit Party
         Obligations without the written consent of each Lender and each Hedging
         Agreement Provider directly affected thereby; or

              (viii) amend, modify or waive the order in which the Credit
         Party Obligations are paid in Section 3.7(b) without the written
         consent of each Lender and each Hedging Agreement Provider directly
         affected thereby.

         Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and any
such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the
Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event
of Default permanently waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing;
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of
Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

         Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent of
the Borrower shall not be required for any amendment, modification or waiver of
the provisions of Section 9 (other than the provisions of Section 9.9);
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent will provide written notice to
the Borrower of any such amendment, modification or waiver. In addition, the
Borrower and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to modify
this Credit Agreement by unilaterally amending or supplementing Schedule 2.1(a)
from time to time in the manner requested by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in order to reflect any assignments or transfers of the
Loans as provided for hereunder; provided further, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of any such modification to
the Borrower and each Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a
Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

         11.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

         No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

         11.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement and the Notes
and the making of the Loans; provided that all such representations and
warranties shall terminate on the date upon which the Commitments have been
terminated and all Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full.

         11.5 Payment of Expenses and Taxes.

         The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree (a) to pay or reimburse
the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger for all their reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development,
preparation, negotiation, printing and execution of, and any amendment,
supplement or modification to, this Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith,
and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, together with the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to
the Administrative Agent and the Lead



                                       76
<PAGE>

Arranger, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for
all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or
preservation of any rights under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel to the Administrative Agent and to the Lenders, and (c) on demand, to
pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from,
any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect
to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other similar
taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection
with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of
the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification
of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, the Credit Documents and
any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and
the Administrative Agent and their Affiliates harmless from and against, any and
all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of the Credit Documents and any such other documents and the use,
or proposed use, of proceeds of the Loans (all of the foregoing, collectively,
the "indemnified liabilities"); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not
have any obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with
respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any such Lender, as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment. The
agreements in this Section 11.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans, Notes and
all other Credit Party Obligations.

         11.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Lenders.

         (a) This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future
holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns, except that
the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents without the prior written
consent of each Lender.

         (b) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other
entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender, and/or any
other interest of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a
Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
under this Credit Agreement to the other parties to this Credit Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for
all purposes under this Credit Agreement, and the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement. No Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the
Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such
amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note
in which such Participant is participating, or reduce the stated rate or extend
the time of payment of interest or fees thereon (except in connection with a
waiver of



                                       77
<PAGE>

interest at the increased post-default rate) or reduce the principal amount
thereof, or increase the amount of the Participant's participation over the
amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default
or Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
participation, and that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted
without consent of any Participant if the Participant's participation is not
increased as a result thereof), (ii) release any of the Guarantors from its
obligations under the Guaranty, or (iii) consent to the assignment or transfer
by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement. In the case of any such participation, the Participant shall not have
any rights under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the
Participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be
those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the
Participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder
shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; provided
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10, 3.11,
3.12 and 11.5 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans
outstanding from time to time; provided further, that no Participant shall be
entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount
of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant
had no such transfer occurred.

         (c) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time, sell or assign to any Lender, or
any Affiliate or Related Fund thereof and, with the consent of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower (in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), or to one or more additional banks or financial
institutions or entities ("Purchasing Lenders"), all or any part of its rights
and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the Notes in minimum amounts of
$5,000,000 with respect to its Commitment and Loans (or, if less, the entire
amount of such Lender's Commitment and Loans), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer
Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Lender, such transferor Lender (and, to
the extent required above, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower), and
delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the
Register; provided that any sale or assignment to an existing Lender, or
Affiliate or Related Fund thereof, shall not require the consent of the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower nor shall any such sale or assignment be
subject to the minimum assignment amounts specified herein. Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the Transfer Effective Date
specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Lender
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement,
be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case
of a Commitment Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining portion of a
transferor Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such
transferor Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided, however, that such
Lender shall still be entitled to any indemnification rights hereunder). Such
Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Credit Agreement to
the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising
from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights
and obligations of such



                                       78
<PAGE>

transferor Lender under this Credit Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the
Transfer Effective Date specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the
Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for
the Notes delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement new Notes to the order of such Purchasing Lender in an
amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement and, unless the transferor Lender has not retained a
Commitment hereunder, new Notes to the order of the transferor Lender in an
amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be
dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes replaced
thereby.

         (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in Section 11.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it
and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to
each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive,
in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the
owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Credit Agreement.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (e) Upon its receipt of a duly executed Commitment Transfer Supplement,
together with payment to the Administrative Agent by the transferor Lender or
the Purchasing Lender, as agreed between them, of a registration and processing
fee of $3,500 for each Purchasing Lender listed in such Commitment Transfer
Supplement and the Notes subject to such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the
Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt
notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

         (f) The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant
or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any
and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning the
Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on
behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement or which has been
delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with such
Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries prior to
becoming a party to this Credit Agreement, in each case subject to Section
11.15.

         (g) At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 11.5 to a
Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States
person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for United
States federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall provide
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue
Service Forms (and, if applicable, a 3.13 Certificate) described in Section
3.13.

         (h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or assigning
any of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including, without limitation,
any right to payment of principal and interest under any Note) to any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable laws.



                                       79

         11.7 Adjustments; Set-off.

         (a) Each Lender agrees that if any Lender (a "Benefited Lender") shall
at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 8.1(e), or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any
such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect
of such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such Benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such
portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits
of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each Lender so
purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

         (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by
law (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off), each Lender shall
have the right, without prior notice to any Credit Party, any such notice being
expressly waived by the Credit Parties to the extent permitted by applicable
law, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, to setoff and appropriate and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any
currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent,
matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or
agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party, or any
part thereof in such amounts as such Lender may elect, against and on account of
the obligations and liabilities of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties to
such Lender hereunder and claims of every nature and description of such Lender
against the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, in any currency, whether
arising hereunder, under the Notes or under any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein, as such Lender may elect, whether or not such
Lender has made any demand for payment and although such obligations,
liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. The aforesaid right of
set-off may be exercised by such Lender against any Credit Party or against any
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of any such
Credit Party, or against anyone else claiming through or against any such Credit
Party or any such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor,
notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the applicable Credit Party and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.
