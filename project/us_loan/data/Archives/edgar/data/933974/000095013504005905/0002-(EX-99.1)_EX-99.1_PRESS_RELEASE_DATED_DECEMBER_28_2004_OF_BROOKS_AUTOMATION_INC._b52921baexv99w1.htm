<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Brooks Automation Announces Accelerated Vesting of Certain Underwater Stock Options</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CHELMSFORD, MA, Dec. 28, 2004 &#151; Brooks Automation, Inc (NASDAQ: BRKS), which develops and
produces hardware, software and systems that enable manufacturing efficiencies for the
semiconductor and other complex manufacturing industries, today announced it has accelerated the
vesting of certain unvested stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible
participants under the Company&#146;s various stock option plans, other than its 1993 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan, which had exercise prices that were under water as of market close on
December&nbsp;23, 2004 . Options to purchase approximately 1.3&nbsp;million shares became
exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration. The Company is taking this action
because it may produce a more favorable impact on the Company&#146;s results from operations in light of
the recent announcement of the effectiveness of FAS123&#174; later in 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Safe Harbor Statement under Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Some statements in
this press release are forward-looking statements made under Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and
uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause Brooks to experience financial results that
differ materially from our expectations. These statements are based on current management
expectations and analysis. These forward-looking statements include all statements regarding the
accounting treatment for stock options, the estimated impact of the acceleration of vesting on
compensation expense or otherwise and all statements other than those made solely with respect to
historical fact. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are
not limited to, the possibility that the acceleration of vesting referred to in this release will
be determined to be &#147;non-substantive&#148;; with the result that the Company will be required to
recognize share-based compensation expense in amounts that may be greater or less than those
specified above in the quarterly period ended December&nbsp;31 or in future periods and which may
require a restatement of previously reported earnings; the possibility that subsequent
pronouncements or interpretations of the FASB or other regulatory bodies may alter the accounting
treatment prescribed for stock options; as well as other risk factors detailed in the Company&#146;s
filings with the SEC, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q. As a result we can provide no assurance that our future results will not be
materially different from those projected, which could materially, adversely affect the Company&#146;s
results of operations and market price of its common stock. The Company undertakes no obligation to
revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
