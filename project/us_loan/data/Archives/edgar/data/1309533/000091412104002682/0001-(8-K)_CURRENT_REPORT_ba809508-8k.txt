30-B-3, Class 15-B-1, Class 15-B-2 and Class 15-B-3 (the "Offered
Certificates"), having an aggregate original principal balance of
$245,860,452.00. The Offered Certificates were issued pursuant to a Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, dated November 29, 2004, among the Registrant, Bank of

"Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto. Mortgage

consisting principally of four pools of fixed interest rate, conventional,
monthly pay, fully-amortizing, one- to four-family residential first mortgage
loans. The remaining undivided interests in the Trust are evidenced by the
Private Certificates distributions on which are subordinated to distributions on
the Offered Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement. Distributions of interest and in reduction of principal balance on
any Distribution Date will be made to the extent that the related Pool
Distribution Amount is sufficient therefor.

            An elections will be made to treat the Trust as a REMIC for federal
income tax purposes (the "REMIC"). The Class 1-CB-1, Class 2-CB-1, Class 2-CB-2,
