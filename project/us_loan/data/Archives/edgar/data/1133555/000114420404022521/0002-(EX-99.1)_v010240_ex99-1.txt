                             [Husker Ag Letterhead]



December 17, 2004

Dear Member:

We are providing this letter to assist you with your year-end tax planning.

As a reminder, Husker Ag is taxed as a partnership. Therefore, the Company's
2004 taxable income will be allocated among the members on a pro-rata basis. The
Company's tax preparer, using information provided by us, has calculated the
Company's projected taxable income for 2004 along with other relevant items.
These projected amounts are listed below on a per unit basis:

                                                                        Amount
                                                                       Per Unit
                                                                       --------

     Estimated Taxable Income                                           $673.00

     Estimated Federal Tax Credit for Ethanol used as a Fuel            $ 97.00

     Estimated Nebraska Add-Back for Bonus Depreciation                 $ 12.00

YOU ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE AMOUNTS SHOWN ABOVE ARE  ESTIMATES.  WHILE WE BELIEVE
THAT THESE AMOUNTS ARE REASONABLY ACCURATE, THE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY
DIFFERENT FROM OUR PROJECTIONS.  In addition,  the information  provided in this
letter is simply an overview of some of the tax issues our members should review
and  consider.  They may or may not be  applicable  to your tax  situation.  You
should  contact  your  tax  adviser  if you  have any  questions  regarding  the
information provided in this letter.

The following are some of the tax issues related to your ownership in Husker Ag:

      1. The Company's taxable income is allocated to all of its members whether
or not Husker Ag makes any distributions during the year.

      2. The amount of  distributions  made by Husker Ag to our  members  during
2004 does not affect, in any way, the estimated taxable income per unit reported
above.

      3. The distributions  made by Husker Ag to the members during the year are
generally not taxable -- unless the amount received  exceeds your adjusted basis
in the Company.

      4. All members,  including those who are not Nebraska residents, will once
again be required to file Nebraska income tax returns for 2004.

      5. The federal tax credit for ethanol  used as a fuel is a credit based on
the Company's qualified ethanol fuel production.  This is a tax credit which may
be available to offset a member's federal income taxes.  Please contact your tax
adviser to  determine  whether  you are  eligible  for this tax  credit.  In the
alternative,  you should review IRS Form 6478 and Publication 378 for additional
information regarding this credit.

      6. The Nebraska  "add-back for bonus  depreciation"  must be added to your
Nebraska  income  tax  return  as  additional  taxable  income.  Therefore,  the
estimated  share of the Company's  taxable  income for your Nebraska  income tax
return is $685.00 per unit ($673.00 + $12.00 = $685.00).

      7. If any member of Husker Ag is a partnership,  S corporation,  estate or
trust,  then the  numbers  shown  above  must be  divided  among  the  partners,
shareholders or beneficiaries as appropriate.

      8. The  estimated  numbers  reported  above have been  calculated on a per
unit, full year  equivalency.  In other words, if some or all of your membership
units were  transferred  to you during 2004,  your portion of these amounts will
generally be proportional to the length of time that you owned such units during
2004.

These  discussions and conclusions are based on the facts as stated and existing
authorities as of the date of this letter. The estimated amounts could change as
a result of changes in the applicable laws and regulations. The Company is under
no obligation to update this letter if such changes occur.

Kind regards,
