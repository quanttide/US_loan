<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests not voted either in favor of or against the merger are effectively counted against the merger. However, approximately 91% of all votes cast by limited
partners not affiliated with NTS&nbsp;Realty or any of the Existing Partnerships were voted in favor of the merger. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTS&nbsp;Realty
also jointly announced with NTS-Properties&nbsp;III and NTS-Properties&nbsp;IV that limited partners holding in excess of fifty percent
(50%) of the outstanding limited partnership interests in each of NTS-Properties&nbsp;III and NTS-Properties IV voted in favor of amending their respective limited
partnership agreements. The purpose of the amendments is to cause NTS-Properties&nbsp;III and NTS-Properties&nbsp;IV to be subject to the Georgia Revised Uniform Limited
Partnership Act and the Kentucky Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, respectively, thus effectively permitting the merger to occur. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
spokesperson for NTS&nbsp;Realty explained that the merger is expected to occur on December&nbsp;28, 2004, shortly after trading on the American Stock Exchange closes at 4:00
eastern time. NTS&nbsp;Realty expects that its limited partnership units will be able to be traded on the American Stock Exchange beginning on or about December&nbsp;29, 2004, on a
"when-issued" basis, as described in its press release dated December&nbsp;17, 2004. NTS&nbsp;Realty will issue a subsequent press release announcing, among other things, the final net
asset value for each Existing Partnership and the number of NTS&nbsp;Realty's limited partnership units to be issued for interests in each Existing Partnership. However, after the merger has
occurred, but prior to the time that NTS&nbsp;Realty's limited partnership units are able to be traded on the American Stock Exchange, NTS&nbsp;Realty will deliver to its transfer agent
information regarding the number of its limited partnership units allocated among the limited partners of the Existing Partnerships. The limited partners may contact NTS&nbsp;Realty's transfer agent
at (800)&nbsp;780-7441 to receive information regarding the number of NTS&nbsp;Realty's limited partnership units that they own after the merger occurs. </FONT></P>
