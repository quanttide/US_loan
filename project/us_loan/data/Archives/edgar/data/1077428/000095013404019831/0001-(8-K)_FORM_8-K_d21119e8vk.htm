<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the new employment agreements has a two-year term, subject to renewal, and has a
compensation package that includes a base salary, bonus and participation in our discretionary
incentive bonus plan for key executives. As part of his compensation, each of the executives is
also eligible to participate in our 1999 Omnibus Stock Plan and is entitled to participate in the
benefit programs generally available to our employees as well as those specifically available to
our executive employees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of each employment agreement provide for severance payments to an executive upon
termination of his employment by us on 30&nbsp;days notice without cause or termination by the executive
for good reason. Upon termination without cause or upon resignation for good reason, the executive
is entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits:

salary for the remaining employment term or twelve months salary and to continued medical insurance
benefits, at our expense, for twelve months. The agreement does not provide for severance for
termination of the executive by us with cause or by the executive without good reason; however,
upon such a termination or resignation, the executive is entitled to salary earned before the
effective date of termination or resignation, accrued but unpaid vacation benefits and previously
authorized but unreimbursed business expenses.

an executive subsequently is terminated either (1)&nbsp;by us or the successor entity without cause or
(2)&nbsp;by the executive for good reason, during the period beginning 90&nbsp;days before and ending one
year after, the change of control event, the executive is entitled to receive a lump sum payment
equal to 250% of the executive&#146;s base salary and any bonuses paid to the executive during the two
years preceding the change of control. This change of control payment is in lieu of any other
amounts to which the executive would be entitled under his employment agreement. In addition, the
executive will receive, for 24&nbsp;months following his termination, continued health and welfare
benefits no less favorable than the benefits to which he was entitled prior the change of control.

ability to be engaged or involved in a competing state or national bank with a principal place of
business in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma or Louisiana during his employment and for the twelve month

agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Bartholow and contains substantially similar terms as our employment agreements

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, we entered into indemnification agreements with each of Messrs.&nbsp;Grant,
Jones, Cargill and Bartholow. These agreements require us to indemnify each of these executives
against liabilities they may incur as a result of their service as an officer or director of us or
our subsidiary, Texas Capital Bank, N.A. The agreements also require us to advance expenses
incurred by an executive in connection with any proceeding for which the executive is entitled to
indemnification. We must make these advancements within 30&nbsp;days of a request from an executive,
and the advances are interest and security free and without regard to the executive&#146;s ability to
repay.

our Chief Financial Officer and one of our directors, and replaced it with the employment agreement
described above so that all of the members of our executive management team would have similar
employment terms for internal record keeping and consistency purposes. Mr.&nbsp;Bartholow consented to
the termination of his prior employment agreement and we did not incur any material penalties as a
result of the termination of Mr.&nbsp;Bartholow&#146;s prior employment agreement. The terms of Mr.
Bartholow&#146;s prior employment agreement were substantially similar to those of his new employment
agreement described above, other than the terms relating to severance.
