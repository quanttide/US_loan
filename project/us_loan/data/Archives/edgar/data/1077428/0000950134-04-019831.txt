compensation package that includes a base salary, bonus and participation in our discretionary
incentive bonus plan for key executives. As part of his compensation, each of the executives is
also eligible to participate in our 1999 Omnibus Stock Plan and is entitled to participate in the
benefit programs generally available to our employees as well as those specifically available to
our executive employees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of each employment agreement provide for severance payments to an executive upon
termination of his employment by us on 30&nbsp;days notice without cause or termination by the executive

is entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits:

salary for the remaining employment term or twelve months salary and to continued medical insurance
benefits, at our expense, for twelve months. The agreement does not provide for severance for
termination of the executive by us with cause or by the executive without good reason; however,
upon such a termination or resignation, the executive is entitled to salary earned before the
effective date of termination or resignation, accrued but unpaid vacation benefits and previously
authorized but unreimbursed business expenses.

an executive subsequently is terminated either (1)&nbsp;by us or the successor entity without cause or
(2)&nbsp;by the executive for good reason, during the period beginning 90&nbsp;days before and ending one
year after, the change of control event, the executive is entitled to receive a lump sum payment
equal to 250% of the executive&#146;s base salary and any bonuses paid to the executive during the two
years preceding the change of control. This change of control payment is in lieu of any other
amounts to which the executive would be entitled under his employment agreement. In addition, the
executive will receive, for 24&nbsp;months following his termination, continued health and welfare
benefits no less favorable than the benefits to which he was entitled prior the change of control.

agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Bartholow and contains substantially similar terms as our employment agreements

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, we entered into indemnification agreements with each of Messrs.&nbsp;Grant,
Jones, Cargill and Bartholow. These agreements require us to indemnify each of these executives
against liabilities they may incur as a result of their service as an officer or director of us or
our subsidiary, Texas Capital Bank, N.A. The agreements also require us to advance expenses
incurred by an executive in connection with any proceeding for which the executive is entitled to
indemnification. We must make these advancements within 30&nbsp;days of a request from an executive,
and the advances are interest and security free and without regard to the executive&#146;s ability to
repay.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;20, 2004, we terminated our existing employment agreement with Peter B. Bartholow,
our Chief Financial Officer and one of our directors, and replaced it with the employment agreement
described above so that all of the members of our executive management team would have similar
employment terms for internal record keeping and consistency purposes. Mr.&nbsp;Bartholow consented to
the termination of his prior employment agreement and we did not incur any material penalties as a
result of the termination of Mr.&nbsp;Bartholow&#146;s prior employment agreement. The terms of Mr.
Bartholow&#146;s prior employment agreement were substantially similar to those of his new employment
agreement described above, other than the terms relating to severance.

<DESCRIPTION>EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT - JOSEPH M. GRANT
<TEXT>
<PAGE>

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.1

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      This Executive Employment Agreement (this "Agreement"), effective on the
date hereof, is entered into in Dallas, Texas, by and between Texas Capital
Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business
located at 2100 McKinney Avenue, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas, 75201 ("Employer"),
and Joseph M. Grant ("Executive").

      In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, Employer and
Executive, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.    Employment Relationship. Employer hereby employs Executive, and Executive
      hereby accepts such employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth in
      this Agreement. Such employment relationship shall continue for the stated
      term of this Agreement, as described in Section 8 hereof, unless earlier
      terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

2.    Position and Responsibilities of Executive. Executive shall be employed as
      Chairman and Chief Executive Officer with job responsibilities related
      thereto, and such job responsibilities may be expanded at the sole
      discretion of the Board of Directors of Employer ("Board"). Executive
      shall devote such time, skill and attention to the business of Employer as
      shall be required for the efficient management thereof, and shall manage
      and supervise such business, and shall devote his full time best efforts
      to the faithful performance of his duties on behalf of Employer, provided,
      however, Executive may engage in appropriate civic, charitable or
      religious activities and devote a reasonable amount of time to private
      investments or boards or other activities provided that such activities do
      not interfere or conflict with the Executive's responsibilities to
      Employer and are not likely to be contrary to Employer's interests.
      Executive shall also perform such other duties, and may have job
      responsibilities and titles modified from time to time as may be requested
      by the Board, provided such duties are generally consistent with the level
      of the Executive's current duties. Executive's duties shall be performed
      at Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas. The location at which Executive
      performs his duties shall not be relocated more than fifty (50) miles from
      Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas on the date hereof, without
      Executive's written consent. Executive shall not engage in any employment
      of any kind or undertake any role or position, whether or not for
      compensation, with any person or entity during the term of this Agreement
      without advance approval of the Executive Committee of the Board, except
      as otherwise noted above.

3.    Compensation. For all services rendered by Executive pursuant to this
      Agreement, Employer shall pay to Executive, and Executive shall accept as
      full compensation hereunder the following:

      a.    Salary. Executive shall receive a salary of $300,000 per year
            payable by Employer in semi-monthly amounts. Executive's salary
            shall be subject to all appropriate federal and state withholding
            taxes and shall be payable in accordance with the normal payroll
            procedures of Employer. Employer shall not reduce Executive's salary
            without Executive's written consent. Employer agrees to

                                       1
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            consider increasing such base salary at least annually during the
            Initial Employment Term and any Renewal Term (as those terms are
            defined herein), but shall not be obligated to effectuate such an
            increase.

      b.    Benefits and Perquisites. Executive shall be entitled to participate
            in the benefit plans provided by Employer for all employees
            generally, and for executive employees of Employer. Employer shall
            be entitled to change or terminate such plans in its sole
            discretion. The parties acknowledge that at the initial date of this
            Agreement the fringe benefits provided to Executive include a
            corporate 401(k) plan, health, dental, life, short and long-term
            disability insurance, and reimbursement of certain expenses in
            accordance with the policies and procedures of Employer.

      c.    Discretionary Bonuses. The Board shall establish an incentive bonus
            plan for its key executives based on various targets and performance
            criteria to be established by the Board. Executive shall be
            permitted to participate in such plan. The evaluation of the
            performance of Executive as measured by the applicable targets and
            the awarding of applicable bonuses, if any, shall be at the sole
            discretion of the Board. The annual discretionary bonus may be
            awarded in whole or in part, based on the level of incentive bonus
            plan performance criteria achieved by Executive, in the sole
            judgement of the Board. If Executive terminates this Agreement
            without Good Reason, as defined in Section 5(d), or if Employer
            terminates this Agreement at any time for Cause, as defined in
            Section 5(b), Executive will not be paid any Discretionary Bonus, in
            whole or in part.

      d.    Equity Compensation. Employer establishes equity-based incentives
            for its executives from time to time pursuant to its 1999 Omnibus
            Stock Plan and, potentially, such other equity compensation programs
            as may be adopted by Employer in the future (collectively, the
            "Plan"). Employer may, but is not obligated to, make grants of
            equity-based incentive compensation to Executive pursuant to the
            terms of such Plan.

4.    Protective Covenants. Executive recognizes that his employment by Employer
      is one of the highest trust and confidence because (i) Executive has
      become and/or in the future will become familiar with critical aspects of
      Employer's business during the period of his employment with Employer,
      (ii) certain information of which Executive will gain knowledge during his
      employment by Employer is proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret
      information and is of special and peculiar value to Employer, and (iii) if
      any such proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information were
      imparted to or became known by any person, including Executive, engaging
      in a business in competition with that of Employer, hardship, loss and
      irreparable injury and damage could result to Employer, the measurement of
      which would be difficult if not impossible to ascertain. Executive further
      acknowledges that Employer has developed unique concepts, lending
      practices, sales presentations, marketing programs, marketing strategies,
      business practices, methods of operation, pricing information, cost
      information, trademarks, licenses, technical information, proprietary
      information, computer software programs,

                                       2
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      tapes and disks concerning its operations systems, customer lists,
      customer leads, documents identifying past, present and future customers,
      customer profile and preference data, hiring and training methods,
      investment policies, financial and other confidential, proprietary and/or
      trade secret information concerning its operations and expansion plans
      ("Confidential Information"). Therefore, Executive agrees that it is
      necessary for Employer to protect its business and that of its affiliates
      from such damage, and Executive further agrees that the following
      covenants constitute a reasonable and appropriate means, consistent with
      the best interest of both Executive and Employer, to protect Employer or
      its affiliates against damage due to loss or disclosure of Confidential
      Information and shall apply to and be binding upon Executive as provided
      herein:

      a.    Confidential Information. Employer agrees to provide Executive with
            some or all of its Confidential Information (as defined above)
            during the term of this Agreement (as set forth in Section 8 below).
            Executive recognizes that his position with Employer is one of the
            highest trust and confidence by reason of Executive's access to and
            contact with certain Confidential Information of Employer. Executive
            agrees and covenants that, except as may be required by Employer in
            connection with this Agreement, or with the prior written consent of
            Employer, Executive shall not, either during the term of this
            Agreement or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, use for
            Executive's own benefit or for the benefit of another, or disclose,
            disseminate, or distribute to another, except as directed by
            Employer or as required for the performance of Executive's duties on
            behalf of Employer, any Confidential Information (whether or not
            acquired, learned, obtained, or developed by Executive alone or in
            conjunction with others) of Employer or of others with whom Employer
            has a business relationship, provided, however that this restriction
            shall not apply to truthful testimony given under oath in a legal
            proceeding by Executive pursuant to a properly issued subpoena if
            Executive provides timely notice of such subpoena to Employer. All
            Confidential Information, and all memoranda, notes, records,
            drawings, documents, or other writings whatsoever made, compiled,
            acquired, or received by Executive at any time during his employment
            with Employer, including during the term of this Agreement, arising
            out of, in connection with, or related to any activity or business
            of Employer, including, but not limited to, the customers,
            suppliers, or others with whom Employer has a business relationship,
            the arrangements of Employer with such parties, and the pricing and
            expansion policies and strategy of Employer, are, and shall continue
            to be, the sole and exclusive property of Employer and shall,
            together with all copies thereof, and any and all documents
            constituting or relating to Employer's Confidential Information, be
            delivered to Employer by Executive immediately, without demand, upon
            the termination of this Agreement, or at any time upon Employer's
            demand.

                  Executive acknowledges that Employer would not employ
            Executive or provide Executive access to Employer's Confidential
            Information and proprietary information but for Executive's
            covenants and promises contained in this Section 4.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                  Executive represents and warrants that he is not bound by any
            agreement with any prior employer or other party that will be
            breached by execution and performance of this Agreement, or which
            would otherwise prevent him from performing his duties with Employer
            as set forth in this Agreement. Executive represents and warrants
            that he has not retained any copies of proprietary or confidential
            information of any prior employer, and he will not use or rely on
            any confidential and proprietary information of any prior employer
            in carrying out his duties for Employer.

      b.    Covenant Not to Compete. In consideration of the numerous mutual
            promises and agreements contained in this Agreement between Employer
            and Executive, including, without limitation, those involving
            Confidential Information, and in order to protect Employer's
            Confidential Information and to reduce the likelihood of irreparable
            damage which would occur in the event such information is provided
            to or used by a competitor of Employer, Executive agrees that during
            his employment and for an additional period of twelve (12) months
            immediately following the termination of his employment, whether
            voluntary or involuntary (the "Noncompetition Term"), not to,
            directly or indirectly, either through any form of ownership or as
            an individual, director, officer, principal, agent, employee,
            employer, adviser, consultant, shareholder, partner, member, or in
            any individual or representative capacity whatsoever, without the
            prior written consent of Employer (which consent may be withheld in
            its sole discretion), (i) compete for or solicit business for or on
            behalf of any person or business entity operating a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services with a place of
            business in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana;
            (ii) own, operate, participate in, undertake any employment with or
            have any interest in any entity with a place of business in Texas,
            New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana related to the
            operation of a state or national bank or company providing similar
            services, except owning publicly traded stock for investment
            purposes only in which Executive owns less than 5%, (iii) compete
            for or solicit business related to the operation of a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services from any
            customer of Employer (or its successors by merger); or (iv) use in
            any competition, solicitation, or marketing effort any Confidential
            Information, any proprietary list, or any information concerning
            customers of Employer.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that the geographic boundaries,
            scope of prohibited activities and the time duration of the
            provisions of this Section 4 are reasonable and are no broader than
            are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of
            Employer. This noncompetition provision shall survive the
            termination of Executive's employment and can only be revoked or
            modified by a writing signed by the parties that specifically states
            an intent to revoke or modify this provision. Executive acknowledges
            that Employer would not employ him or provide him with access to its
            Confidential Information but for his covenants or promises contained
            in this Section.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                  Employer and Executive agree and stipulate that the agreements
            and covenants not to compete contained in this Section 4 hereof are
            fair and reasonable in light of all of the facts and circumstances
            of the relationship between Executive and Employer; however,
            Executive and Employer are aware that in certain circumstances
            courts have refused to enforce certain terms of agreements not to
            compete. Therefore, in furtherance of, and not in derogation of the
            provisions of this Section 4, Employer and Executive agree that in
            the event a court should decline to enforce any terms of any of the
            provisions of this Section 4, that Section 4 shall be deemed to be
            modified or reformed to restrict Executive's competition with
            Employer or its affiliates to the maximum extent, as to time,
            geography and business scope, which the court shall find
            enforceable; provided, however, in no event shall the provisions of
            this Section 4 be deemed to be more restrictive to Executive than
            those contained herein.

                  Executive agrees that during the Noncompetition Term, he shall
            immediately notify Employer in writing of any employment, work or
            business he undertakes with or on behalf of any person (including
            himself) or entity.

      c.    Non-Solicitation. Executive agrees that during his employment, and
            for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of his
            employment, for whatever reason, that neither he nor any individual,
            partner(s), limited partnership, corporation or other entity or
            business with which he is in any way affiliated, including, without
            limitation, any partner, limited partner, member, director, officer,
            shareholder, employee, or agent of any such entity or business, will
            (i) request, induce or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly,
            any employee of Employer to terminate their employment with Employer
            or (ii) employ any person who as of the date of this Agreement was,
            or after such date, is an employee of Employer. Executive further
            agrees that during the period beginning with the commencement of
            Executive's employment with Employer and ending twelve (12) months
            after the termination of Executive's employment with Employer, for
            whatever reason, he shall not, directly or indirectly, as an
            individual, employee, agent, consultant, stockholder, director,
            partner or in any other individual or representative capacity of
            Employer or of any other person, entity or business, solicit or
            encourage any present or future customer, supplier, contractor,
            partner or investor of Employer to terminate, limit or otherwise
            alter his, her or its relationship with Employer.

      d.    Work Product. For purposes of this Section 4, "Work Product" shall
            mean all intellectual property rights, including all trade secrets,
            U.S. and international copyrights, patentable inventions,
            discoveries and other intellectual property rights in any
            programming, design, documentation, technology, or other work
            product that is created in connection with Executive's work. In
            addition, all rights in any preexisting programming, design,
            documentation, technology, or other Work Product provided to
            Employer during Executive's employment shall automatically become
            part of the Work Product hereunder, whether or not it arises
            specifically out of Executive's "Work." For purposes of this
            Agreement, "Work"

                                       5
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            shall mean (i) any direct assignments and required performance by or
            for Employer, and (ii) any other productive output that relates to
            the business of Employer and is produced during the course of
            Executive's employment or engagement by Employer. For this purpose,
            Work may be considered present even after normal working hours, away
            from Employer's premises, on an unsupervised basis, alone or with
            others. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Board, this
            Agreement shall apply to all Work Product created in connection with
            all Work conducted before or after the date of this Agreement.

                  Employer shall own all rights in the Work Product. To this
            end, all Work Product shall be considered work made for hire for
            Employer. If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law or
            agreement, be considered Work made by Executive for hire for
            Employer (or if ownership of all rights therein do not otherwise
            vest exclusively in Employer immediately), Executive agrees to
            assign, and upon creation thereof does hereby automatically assign,
            without further consideration, the ownership thereof to Employer.
            Executive hereby irrevocably relinquishes for the benefit of
            Employer and its assigns any moral rights in the Work Product
            recognized by applicable law. Employer shall have the right to
            obtain and hold, in whatever name or capacity it selects,
            copyrights, registrations, and any other protection available in the
            Work Product.

                  Executive agrees to perform upon the request of Employer,
            during or after Executive's Work or employment, such further acts as
            may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend
            Employer's ownership of the Work Product, including by (i)
            executing, acknowledging, and delivering any requested affidavits
            and documents of assignment and conveyance, (ii) obtaining and/or
            aiding in the enforcement of copyrights, trade secrets, and (if
            applicable) patents with respect to the Work Product in any
            countries, and (iii) providing testimony in connection with any
            proceeding affecting the rights of Employer in any Work Product. In
            the event that Executive is required to perform the services
            described in this paragraph after his employment with the Employer
            has terminated, Executive will be reasonably compensated for actual
            time spent providing such services.

                  Executive warrants that his Work for Employer does not and
            will not in any way conflict with any obligations Executive may have
            with any prior employer or contractor. Executive also agrees to
            develop all Work Product in a manner that avoids even the appearance
            of infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights.

      e.    Survival of Covenants. Each covenant of Executive set forth in this
            Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
            Executive's employment for any reason and shall be construed as an
            agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and
            the existence of any claim or cause of action of Executive against
            Employer whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise shall not
            constitute a defense to the enforcement by Employer of said
            covenant.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            No modification or waiver of any covenant contained in this Section
            4 shall be valid unless such waiver or modification is approved in
            writing by the Board.

      f.    Remedies. In the event of a breach, violation or threatened breach
            or violation by Executive of any provision of this Section 4,
            Executive agrees that Employer shall be entitled to relief by
            temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent
            injunction or otherwise, in addition to other legal and equitable
            relief to which it may be entitled, including any and all monetary
            damages which Employer may incur as a result of said breach,
            violation or threatened breach or violation. Employer may pursue any
            remedy available to it concurrently or consecutively in any order as
            to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the
            pursuit of one of such remedies at any time will not be deemed an
            election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other of
            such remedies as to such breach, violation, or threatened breach or
            violation, or as to any other breach, violation, or threatened
            breach or violation.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that Executive's agreement to be
            bound by the protective covenants set forth in this Section 4 was a
            material inducement for Employer entering into this Agreement,
            agreeing to pay Executive the compensation and benefits set forth
            herein, and providing Executive with Employer's Confidential
            Information and other proprietary information.

5.    Termination. The employment relationship between Executive and Employer
      created hereunder shall terminate before the expiration of the stated term
      of this Agreement upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:

      a.    Death or Permanent Disability. The employment relationship shall be
            terminated effective on the death or permanent disability of
            Executive. However, Executive shall be entitled to leaves of absence
            from Employer in accordance with the policy of Employer generally
            applicable to executives for illness or temporary disabilities for a
            period or periods not exceeding three (3) months in any calendar
            year, and his status as an Executive shall continue during such
            periods. However, if Executive qualifies for short-term disability
            payments under Employer's standard short-term disability plan during
            such leave, Executive shall apply to receive such short-term
            disability payments. Employer shall supplement such short term
            disability payments so that Executive receives such monthly amounts
            when combined with the short term disability payments to equal
            Executive's monthly compensation as set forth in Section 3(a) of
            this Agreement. If Executive is incapacitated due to physical or
            mental illness and such incapacity prevents Executive from
            satisfactorily performing his duties for Employer on a full time
            basis for six (6) months or more, Executive shall be deemed to have
            experienced a permanent disability and Employer may terminate this
            Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon the death or
            permanent disability of Executive, Executive or his estate (as the
            case may be) shall be entitled to compensation as provided in
            Sections 6(a), (b) and (c) below.

      b.    Termination for Cause. The following events, which for purposes of
            this Agreement shall constitute "Cause" for termination:

            i.    Any act of fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement by
                  Executive with respect to any aspect of Employer's business;

            ii.   The breach by Executive of any provision of Sections 1, 2 or 4
                  of this Agreement (including but not limited to a refusal to
                  follow lawful directives of the Board, the Chief Executive
                  Officer or their designees which are not inconsistent with the
                  duties of Executive's position and the provisions of this
                  Agreement);

            iii.  The conviction of Executive by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction of a felony or of a crime involving moral
                  turpitude;

            iv.   The intentional and material breach by Executive of any
                  non-disclosure or non-competition/non-solicitation provision
                  of any agreement to which Executive and Employer or any of its
                  subsidiaries are parties;

            v.    The intentional failure by Executive to perform in all
                  material respects his duties and responsibilities (other than
                  as a result of death or disability) and the failure of
                  Executive to cure the same in all material respects within
                  fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from the Chief
                  Executive Officer or his designee;

            vi.   The illegal use of drugs by Executive during the term of this
                  Agreement that, in the determination of the Board,
                  substantially interferes with Executive's performance of his
                  duties hereunder;

            vii.  Acceptance of employment with any other employer except upon
                  written permission of the Board; or

            viii. The breach by Executive of his fiduciary duty to Employer.

            Employer shall provide Executive with a written notice of
            termination, which can be provided on the date of termination. In
            the event Executive's employment is terminated for Cause hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b) and (c) below.

      c.    Termination by Employer with Notice. Employer may terminate this
            Agreement without Cause at any time upon thirty (30) days written
            notice to Executive, during which period Executive shall not be
            required to perform any services for Employer other than to assist
            Employer in training his successor and generally preparing for an
            orderly transition; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Executive shall be
            entitled to compensation upon such termination as provided in
            Section 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

      d.    Termination by Executive For Good Reason. Executive shall be
            entitled to terminate this Agreement at any time for Good Reason.
            For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
            occurrence of any of the following events:

            i.    Without his express written consent, the assignment of
                  Executive to a position functionally inferior to his position
                  with Employer on the date of this Agreement;

            ii.   The change of the location where Executive is based to a
                  location which is more than fifty (50) miles from his present
                  location without Executive's written consent; or

            iii.  A reduction by Employer in Executive's base salary as in
                  effect on the date hereof, unless such reduction is a
                  proportionate reduction of the compensation of Executive and
                  all other senior officers of Employer as a part of a
                  company-wide effort to enhance the financial condition of
                  Employer.

            Executive shall give Employer thirty (30) business days notice of an
            intent to terminate this Agreement for "Good Reason" as defined in
            this Section 5(d), and provide Employer with ten (10) business days
            after receipt of such notice from Executive to remedy the alleged
            violation of Subsections 5(d)(i), (ii) or (iii). In the event
            Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

6.    Compensation Upon Termination. Upon the termination of Executive's
      employment under this Agreement before the expiration of the stated term
      hereof for any reason, Executive shall be entitled to:

      a.    the salary earned by him before the effective date of termination as
            provided in Section 3(a) hereof (including salary payable during any
            applicable notice period), prorated on the basis of the number of
            full days of service rendered by Executive during the salary payment
            period to the effective date of termination;

      b.    any accrued, but unpaid, vacation benefits; and

      c.    any previously authorized but unreimbursed business expenses.

      If Executive's employment hereunder terminates because of the death or
      permanent disability of Executive, Executive shall be entitled to the
      lesser of (i) the balance of Executive's base salary (as set forth in
      Section 3(a) above), if any, remaining in the term of this Agreement or
      (ii) twelve (12) months' base salary. In addition, in the event of
      Executive's permanent disability, Executive shall receive continued
      medical insurance

                                       9

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      benefits, at Employer's expense, for a period of twelve (12) months from
      the date of the termination of this Agreement. All amounts that may be due
      to Executive under this Section 6 or Section 5(a) shall be paid to him or
      his administrators, personal representatives, heirs and legatees, as may
      be appropriate.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or other
      plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the time of
      termination of his employment, Executive's rights and benefits under each
      such plan shall be determined in accordance with the terms, conditions,
      and limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
      Executive which may then be in effect.

      d.    Additional Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination Without Cause,
            With Notice or for Good Reason. If Executive's employment hereunder
            terminates without "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), with
            notice pursuant to Section 5(c) above, or for "Good Reason" (as
            defined in Section 5(d) above) Employer shall, upon Executive's
            execution of a general release of claims in favor of Employer,
            provide to Executive in addition to the amounts set forth in
            Subsections 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) above:

            i.    a cash payment equal to the greater of (y) Executive's base
                  salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any, remaining
                  in the term of Executive's Agreement or (z) twelve (12)
                  months' base salary;

            ii.   a cash payment equal to the average annual cash bonus paid to
                  Executive for the two (2) full bonus plan years immediately
                  preceding the date Executive's employment terminates; and

            iii.  continued medical insurance benefits, at Employer's expense,
                  for a period of twelve (12) months.

            Employer shall pay the severance amounts referenced in Section
            6(d)(i) in equal semi-monthly installments for a period of twelve
            (12) months ("Severance Period") in accordance with Employer's
            regular payroll practices. Executive shall have no obligation to
            mitigate any severance obligation of Employer under this Agreement
            by seeking new employment. Employer shall not be entitled to set off
            or reduce any severance payments owed to Executive under this
            Agreement by the amount of earnings or benefits received by
            Executive in future employment. The provisions of Sections 4, 5 and
            6 hereof shall survive the termination of the employment
            relationship hereunder and this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or
            other plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the
            time of termination of his employment, Executive's rights and
            benefits under each such plan shall be determined in accordance with
            the terms, conditions, and limitations of the plan and any separate
            agreement executed by Executive which may then be in effect.

      e.    If, during the Severance Period, Executive is in breach of his
            post-employment covenants contained in Section 4 of this Agreement,
            Employer shall not be obligated to pay any severance payments
            referenced herein, Employer's severance obligations shall terminate
            and expire, and Employer shall have no further obligations to
            Executive hereunder from and after the date of such breach and shall
            have all other rights and remedies available under this Agreement or
            any other agreement and at law or in equity.

7.    Compensation Upon Change in Control.

      a.    For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of Employer
            shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as:

            i.    any "person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
                  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
                  "Exchange Act")) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as
                  defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of voting securities of Employer representing more
                  than 50% of Employer's outstanding voting securities or rights
                  to acquire such securities except for any voting securities
                  issued or purchased under any employee benefit plan of
                  Employer or its subsidiaries; or

            ii.   individuals who constitute the Board on the date hereof (the
                  "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least
                  a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a
                  director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was
                  approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors
                  comprising the Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for
                  election by Employer's stockholders was approved by a
                  Nominating Committee solely composed of members which are
                  Incumbent Board members, shall be, for purposes of this clause
                  (ii), considered as though he were a member of the Incumbent
                  Board; or

            iii.  a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all
                  or substantially all of the assets of Employer or similar
                  transaction occurs or is effectuated in which Employer is not
                  the resulting entity; provided, however, that such an event
                  listed above will be deemed to have occurred or to have been
                  effectuated upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals
                  not including the lapse of any required waiting periods; or

            iv.   the Board determines in its sole discretion that a Change in
                  Control has occurred.

      b.    Benefits Upon Change in Control.

            i.    Severance Benefits. If Executive's employment with Employer is
                  terminated (A) by Employer (or by the acquiring or successor
                  business

                  entity following a Change of Control) other than for "Cause"
                  (as defined in Section 5(b) above), death or permanent
                  disability, or (B) by Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined
                  in Section 5(d) above) in either event within a period
                  beginning ninety (90) days before, and ending one (1) year
                  after, the date of a Change of Control (the "Change Period"),
                  Executive shall receive a cash severance benefit in an amount
                  equal to the sum of 250% of Executive's average annual cash
                  base salary and bonus in effect for the two (2) years
                  immediately preceding the Change of Control.

                  In addition, for twenty four (24) months following the date of
                  termination of Executive's employment in circumstances in
                  which a severance payment is due under this Section 7(b),
                  Employer shall provide Executive, at Employer's expense,
                  health and other welfare benefits that are not less favorable
                  to Executive than those to which he was entitled immediately
                  prior to the Change in Control. Provided however, Employer
                  shall have no obligation to provide Executive with any
                  severance compensation under this Section 7 if Executive is in
                  breach or violation of any of the covenants contained in
                  Section 4, which are applicable to Executive at the time of
                  the severance payment.

            ii.   Form of Payment. The amount of the severance benefit provided
                  in Section 7(c)(i) hereof shall be paid to Executive in a lump
                  sum within thirty (30) days of Executive's termination, unless
                  such payment must be delayed so as to avoid classification as
                  "deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

            iii.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7, in the
                  event that:

                  (aa)  the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or
                        afforded to Executive, which are deemed to be parachute
                        payments as defined in Code Section 280G or any
                        successor thereof, (the "Termination Benefits") would be
                        deemed to include an "excess parachute payment" under
                        Code Section 280G; and

                  (bb)  if such Termination Benefits were reduced to an amount
                        (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is one
                        dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3)
                        times Executive's "base amount," as determined in
                        accordance with Code Section 280G and the Non-Triggering
                        Amount less the product of the marginal rate of any
                        applicable state and federal income tax and the
                        Non-Triggering Amount would be greater than the
                        aggregate value of the Termination Benefits (without
                        such reduction) minus (a) the amount of tax required to
                        be paid by Executive thereon by Code Section 4999 and
                        further minus (b) the product of the Termination
                        Benefits and the marginal rate of any applicable state

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                        and federal income tax, then the Termination Benefits
                        shall be reduced to the Non-Triggering Amount. The
                        allocation of the reduction required hereby among the
                        Termination Benefits shall be determined by Executive.

            iv.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock
                  options or other plans or programs in which Executive is
                  participating at the time of termination of his employment,
                  Executive's rights and benefits under each such plan shall be
                  determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
                  limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
                  Executive which may then be in effect.

      c.    No Mitigation or Offset. Executive shall not be required to mitigate
            the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 of this
            Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. Employer shall
            not be entitled to set off or reduce any severance payments owed to
            Executive under this Section 7 by the amount of earnings or benefits
            received by Executive in future employment.

8.    Term. This Agreement shall be binding and enforceable against Employer and
      Executive immediately upon its execution by both such parties. The stated
      term of this Agreement and the employment relationship created hereunder
      shall begin on December 20, 2004, and shall remain in effect for two (2)
      years thereafter, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 5
      hereof (the "Initial Employment Term"). This Agreement shall be
      automatically renewed for successive one (1) year terms after the Initial
      Employment Term ("Renewal Term"), unless terminated by either party at
      least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Employment Period
      or any Renewal Term.

      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
      parties' respective rights and obligations under Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7
      shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the
      termination of Executive's employment for any reason whatsoever.

9.    Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
      enforce its rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
      by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise
      all other rights existing in its favor. Notwithstanding Section 10 below,
      the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an
      adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and
      that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or
      equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
      injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the
      provisions of this Agreement.

10.   Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
      Agreement or relating to Executive's rights, compensation and
      responsibilities as an Executive, excluding any claims based on violations
      of Section 4, shall be determined by arbitration in Dallas County, Texas
      in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then
      in effect. The arbitration shall be submitted to a single arbitrator

                                       13

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      selected in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's
      procedures then in effect for the selection of employment arbitrators. The
      parties shall split the cost of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
      the authority to award any remedy that could be awarded by a court of
      competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses and fees
      associated with such arbitration. This Section 10 shall survive
      termination of this Agreement for any reason.

11.   Non-Disparagement. Executive and Employer agree not to make any statements
      that disparage the reputation of (i) Employer, its products, services or
      employees, or (ii) Executive. Executive and Employer further acknowledge
      and agree that any breach or violation of this non-disparagement provision
      shall entitle Executive or Employer to seek injunctive relief to prevent
      any future breaches of this provision and/or to sue the other party on
      this Agreement for the immediate recovery of any damages caused by such
      breach. For purposes of this provision, Employer's obligation shall be
      limited to the Executive Committee of the Board and executives who are
      members of the Employer's Senior Policy Committee.

12.   Assignment. This Agreement is personal to Executive and may not be
      assigned in any way by Executive without the prior written consent of
      Employer. This Agreement shall not be assignable or delegable by Employer,
      other than to an affiliate of Employer; provided, however, that in the
      event of the acquisition, merger or consolidation of Employer, the
      obligations of Employer hereunder shall be binding upon the surviving or
      resulting entity of such acquisition, merger or consolidation. The rights
      and obligations under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
      shall be binding upon the heirs, legatees, administrators and personal
      representatives of Executive and upon the successors, representatives and
      assigns of Employer.

13.   Severability and Reformation. The parties hereto intend all provisions of
      this Agreement to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If,
      however, any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid,
      or unenforceable under present or future law, such provision shall be
      fully severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
      such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision were never a part
      hereof, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect
      and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
      provision or by its severance. In lieu of such illegal, invalid or
      unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of
      this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
      terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
      possible, and Employer and Executive hereby request the court to whom
      disputes relating to this Agreement are submitted to reform the otherwise
      unenforceable covenant in accordance with this Section 13.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      This Executive Employment Agreement (this "Agreement"), effective on the
date hereof, is entered into in Dallas, Texas, by and between Texas Capital
Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business
located at 2100 McKinney Avenue, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas, 75201 ("Employer"),
and George F. Jones, Jr. ("Executive").

      In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, Employer and
Executive, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.    Employment Relationship. Employer hereby employs Executive, and Executive
      hereby accepts such employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth in
      this Agreement. Such employment relationship shall continue for the stated
      term of this Agreement, as described in Section 8 hereof, unless earlier
      terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

2.    Position and Responsibilities of Executive. Executive shall be employed as
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Texas Capital Bank, N.A. with job
      responsibilities related thereto, and such job responsibilities may be
      expanded at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer or the
      Board of Directors of Employer ("Board"). Executive shall devote such
      time, skill and attention to the business of Employer as shall be required
      for the efficient management thereof, and shall manage and supervise such
      business, and shall devote his full time best efforts to the faithful
      performance of his duties on behalf of Employer, provided, however,
      Executive may engage in appropriate civic, charitable or religious
      activities and devote a reasonable amount of time to private investments
      or boards or other activities provided that such activities do not
      interfere or conflict with the Executive's responsibilities to Employer
      and are not likely to be contrary to Employer's interests. Executive shall
      also perform such other duties, and may have job responsibilities and
      titles modified from time to time as may be requested by the Chief
      Executive Officer and/or the Board, provided such duties are generally
      consistent with the level of the Executive's current duties. Executive's
      duties shall be performed at Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas. The
      location at which Executive performs his duties shall not be relocated
      more than fifty (50) miles from Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas on the
      date hereof, without Executive's written consent. Executive shall not
      engage in any employment of any kind or undertake any role or position,
      whether or not for compensation, with any person or entity during the term
      of this Agreement without advance written approval of the Chief Executive
      Officer, who shall give notice of Executive's any such request to the
      Executive Committee of the Board, except as otherwise noted above.

3.    Compensation. For all services rendered by Executive pursuant to this
      Agreement, Employer shall pay to Executive, and Executive shall accept as
      full compensation hereunder the following:

      a.    Salary. Executive shall receive a salary of $275,000 per year
            payable by Employer in semi-monthly amounts. Executive's salary
            shall be subject to all appropriate federal and state withholding
            taxes and shall be payable in accordance

                                       1

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            with the normal payroll procedures of Employer. Employer shall not
            reduce Executive's salary without Executive's written consent.
            Employer agrees to consider increasing such base salary at least
            annually during the Initial Employment Term and any Renewal Term (as
            those terms are defined herein), but shall not be obligated to
            effectuate such an increase.

      b.    Benefits and Perquisites. Executive shall be entitled to participate
            in the benefit plans provided by Employer for all employees
            generally, and for executive employees of Employer. Employer shall
            be entitled to change or terminate such plans in its sole
            discretion. The parties acknowledge that at the initial date of this
            Agreement the fringe benefits provided to Executive include a
            corporate 401(k) plan, health, dental, life, short and long-term
            disability insurance, and reimbursement of certain expenses in
            accordance with the policies and procedures of Employer.

      c.    Discretionary Bonuses. The Board shall establish an incentive bonus
            plan for its key executives based on various targets and performance
            criteria to be established by the Board. Executive shall be
            permitted to participate in such plan. The evaluation of the
            performance of Executive as measured by the applicable targets and
            the awarding of applicable bonuses, if any, shall be at the sole
            discretion of the Board. The annual discretionary bonus may be
            awarded in whole or in part, based on the level of incentive bonus
            plan performance criteria achieved by Executive, in the sole
            judgement of the Board. If Executive terminates this Agreement
            without Good Reason, as defined in Section 5(d), or if Employer
            terminates this Agreement at any time for Cause, as defined in
            Section 5(b), Executive will not be paid any Discretionary Bonus, in
            whole or in part.

      d.    Equity Compensation. Employer establishes equity-based incentives
            for its executives from time to time pursuant to its 1999 Omnibus
            Stock Plan and, potentially, such other equity compensation programs
            as may be adopted by Employer in the future (collectively, the
            "Plan"). Employer may, but is not obligated to, make grants of
            equity-based incentive compensation to Executive pursuant to the
            terms of such Plan.

4.    Protective Covenants. Executive recognizes that his employment by Employer
      is one of the highest trust and confidence because (i) Executive has
      become and/or in the future will become familiar with critical aspects of
      Employer's business during the period of his employment with Employer,
      (ii) certain information of which Executive will gain knowledge during his
      employment by Employer is proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret
      information and is of special and peculiar value to Employer, and (iii) if
      any such proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information were
      imparted to or became known by any person, including Executive, engaging
      in a business in competition with that of Employer, hardship, loss and
      irreparable injury and damage could result to Employer, the measurement of
      which would be difficult if not impossible to ascertain. Executive further
      acknowledges that Employer has developed unique concepts, lending
      practices, sales presentations, marketing programs, marketing strategies,
      business

      practices, methods of operation, pricing information, cost information,
      trademarks, licenses, technical information, proprietary information,
      computer software programs, tapes and disks concerning its operations
      systems, customer lists, customer leads, documents identifying past,
      present and future customers, customer profile and preference data, hiring
      and training methods, investment policies, financial and other
      confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information concerning its
      operations and expansion plans ("Confidential Information"). Therefore,
      Executive agrees that it is necessary for Employer to protect its business
      and that of its affiliates from such damage, and Executive further agrees
      that the following covenants constitute a reasonable and appropriate
      means, consistent with the best interest of both Executive and Employer,
      to protect Employer or its affiliates against damage due to loss or
      disclosure of Confidential Information and shall apply to and be binding
      upon Executive as provided herein:

      a.    Confidential Information. Employer agrees to provide Executive with
            some or all of its Confidential Information (as defined above)
            during the term of this Agreement (as set forth in Section 8 below).
            Executive recognizes that his position with Employer is one of the
            highest trust and confidence by reason of Executive's access to and
            contact with certain Confidential Information of Employer. Executive
            agrees and covenants that, except as may be required by Employer in
            connection with this Agreement, or with the prior written consent of
            Employer, Executive shall not, either during the term of this
            Agreement or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, use for
            Executive's own benefit or for the benefit of another, or disclose,
            disseminate, or distribute to another, except as directed by
            Employer or as required for the performance of Executive's duties on
            behalf of Employer, any Confidential Information (whether or not
            acquired, learned, obtained, or developed by Executive alone or in
            conjunction with others) of Employer or of others with whom Employer
            has a business relationship, provided, however that this restriction
            shall not apply to truthful testimony given under oath in a legal
            proceeding by Executive pursuant to a properly issued subpoena if
            Executive provides timely notice of such subpoena to Employer. All
            Confidential Information, and all memoranda, notes, records,
            drawings, documents, or other writings whatsoever made, compiled,
            acquired, or received by Executive at any time during his employment
            with Employer, including during the term of this Agreement, arising
            out of, in connection with, or related to any activity or business
            of Employer, including, but not limited to, the customers,
            suppliers, or others with whom Employer has a business relationship,
            the arrangements of Employer with such parties, and the pricing and
            expansion policies and strategy of Employer, are, and shall continue
            to be, the sole and exclusive property of Employer and shall,
            together with all copies thereof, and any and all documents
            constituting or relating to Employer's Confidential Information, be
            delivered to Employer by Executive immediately, without demand, upon
            the termination of this Agreement, or at any time upon Employer's
            demand.

                  Executive acknowledges that Employer would not employ
            Executive or provide Executive access to Employer's Confidential
            Information and proprietary

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            information but for Executive's covenants and promises contained in
            this Section 4.

                  Executive represents and warrants that he is not bound by any
            agreement with any prior employer or other party that will be
            breached by execution and performance of this Agreement, or which
            would otherwise prevent him from performing his duties with Employer
            as set forth in this Agreement. Executive represents and warrants
            that he has not retained any copies of proprietary or confidential
            information of any prior employer, and he will not use or rely on
            any confidential and proprietary information of any prior employer
            in carrying out his duties for Employer.

      b.    Covenant Not to Compete. In consideration of the numerous mutual
            promises and agreements contained in this Agreement between Employer
            and Executive, including, without limitation, those involving
            Confidential Information, and in order to protect Employer's
            Confidential Information and to reduce the likelihood of irreparable
            damage which would occur in the event such information is provided
            to or used by a competitor of Employer, Executive agrees that during
            his employment and for an additional period of twelve (12) months
            immediately following the termination of his employment, whether
            voluntary or involuntary (the "Noncompetition Term"), not to,
            directly or indirectly, either through any form of ownership or as
            an individual, director, officer, principal, agent, employee,
            employer, adviser, consultant, shareholder, partner, member, or in
            any individual or representative capacity whatsoever, without the
            prior written consent of Employer (which consent may be withheld in
            its sole discretion), (i) compete for or solicit business for or on
            behalf of any person or business entity operating a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services with a place of
            business in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana;
            (ii) own, operate, participate in, undertake any employment with or
            have any interest in any entity with a place of business in Texas,
            New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana related to the
            operation of a state or national bank or company providing similar
            services, except owning publicly traded stock for investment
            purposes only in which Executive owns less than 5%, (iii) compete
            for or solicit business related to the operation of a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services from any
            customer of Employer (or its successors by merger); or (iv) use in
            any competition, solicitation, or marketing effort any Confidential
            Information, any proprietary list, or any information concerning
            customers of Employer.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that the geographic boundaries,
            scope of prohibited activities and the time duration of the
            provisions of this Section 4 are reasonable and are no broader than
            are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of
            Employer. This noncompetition provision shall survive the
            termination of Executive's employment and can only be revoked or
            modified by a writing signed by the parties that specifically states
            an intent to revoke or modify this provision. Executive acknowledges
            that Employer would not employ him or

                                       4
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            provide him with access to its Confidential Information but for his
            covenants or promises contained in this Section.

                  Employer and Executive agree and stipulate that the agreements
            and covenants not to compete contained in this Section 4 hereof are
            fair and reasonable in light of all of the facts and circumstances
            of the relationship between Executive and Employer; however,
            Executive and Employer are aware that in certain circumstances
            courts have refused to enforce certain terms of agreements not to
            compete. Therefore, in furtherance of, and not in derogation of the
            provisions of this Section 4, Employer and Executive agree that in
            the event a court should decline to enforce any terms of any of the
            provisions of this Section 4, that Section 4 shall be deemed to be
            modified or reformed to restrict Executive's competition with
            Employer or its affiliates to the maximum extent, as to time,
            geography and business scope, which the court shall find
            enforceable; provided, however, in no event shall the provisions of
            this Section 4 be deemed to be more restrictive to Executive than
            those contained herein.

                  Executive agrees that during the Noncompetition Term, he shall
            immediately notify Employer in writing of any employment, work or
            business he undertakes with or on behalf of any person (including
            himself) or entity.

      c.    Non-Solicitation. Executive agrees that during his employment, and
            for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of his
            employment, for whatever reason, that neither he nor any individual,
            partner(s), limited partnership, corporation or other entity or
            business with which he is in any way affiliated, including, without
            limitation, any partner, limited partner, member, director, officer,
            shareholder, employee, or agent of any such entity or business, will
            (i) request, induce or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly,
            any employee of Employer to terminate their employment with Employer
            or (ii) employ any person who as of the date of this Agreement was,
            or after such date, is an employee of Employer. Executive further
            agrees that during the period beginning with the commencement of
            Executive's employment with Employer and ending twelve (12) months
            after the termination of Executive's employment with Employer, for
            whatever reason, he shall not, directly or indirectly, as an
            individual, employee, agent, consultant, stockholder, director,
            partner or in any other individual or representative capacity of
            Employer or of any other person, entity or business, solicit or
            encourage any present or future customer, supplier, contractor,
            partner or investor of Employer to terminate, limit or otherwise
            alter his, her or its relationship with Employer.

      d.    Work Product. For purposes of this Section 4, "Work Product" shall
            mean all intellectual property rights, including all trade secrets,
            U.S. and international copyrights, patentable inventions,
            discoveries and other intellectual property rights in any
            programming, design, documentation, technology, or other work
            product that is created in connection with Executive's work. In
            addition, all rights in any preexisting programming, design,
            documentation, technology, or other

                                       5

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            Work Product provided to Employer during Executive's employment
            shall automatically become part of the Work Product hereunder,
            whether or not it arises specifically out of Executive's "Work." For
            purposes of this Agreement, "Work" shall mean (i) any direct
            assignments and required performance by or for Employer, and (ii)
            any other productive output that relates to the business of Employer
            and is produced during the course of Executive's employment or
            engagement by Employer. For this purpose, Work may be considered
            present even after normal working hours, away from Employer's
            premises, on an unsupervised basis, alone or with others. Unless
            otherwise approved in writing by the Board, this Agreement shall
            apply to all Work Product created in connection with all Work
            conducted before or after the date of this Agreement.

                  Employer shall own all rights in the Work Product. To this
            end, all Work Product shall be considered work made for hire for
            Employer. If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law or
            agreement, be considered Work made by Executive for hire for
            Employer (or if ownership of all rights therein do not otherwise
            vest exclusively in Employer immediately), Executive agrees to
            assign, and upon creation thereof does hereby automatically assign,
            without further consideration, the ownership thereof to Employer.
            Executive hereby irrevocably relinquishes for the benefit of
            Employer and its assigns any moral rights in the Work Product
            recognized by applicable law. Employer shall have the right to
            obtain and hold, in whatever name or capacity it selects,
            copyrights, registrations, and any other protection available in the
            Work Product.

                  Executive agrees to perform upon the request of Employer,
            during or after Executive's Work or employment, such further acts as
            may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend
            Employer's ownership of the Work Product, including by (i)
            executing, acknowledging, and delivering any requested affidavits
            and documents of assignment and conveyance, (ii) obtaining and/or
            aiding in the enforcement of copyrights, trade secrets, and (if
            applicable) patents with respect to the Work Product in any
            countries, and (iii) providing testimony in connection with any
            proceeding affecting the rights of Employer in any Work Product. In
            the event that Executive is required to perform the services
            described in this paragraph after his employment with the Employer
            has terminated, Executive will be reasonably compensated for actual
            time spent providing such services.

                  Executive warrants that his Work for Employer does not and
            will not in any way conflict with any obligations Executive may have
            with any prior employer or contractor. Executive also agrees to
            develop all Work Product in a manner that avoids even the appearance
            of infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights.

      e.    Survival of Covenants. Each covenant of Executive set forth in this
            Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
            Executive's employment for any reason and shall be construed as an
            agreement independent of any other

                                       6
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause
            of action of Executive against Employer whether predicated on this
            Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a defense to the
            enforcement by Employer of said covenant. No modification or waiver
            of any covenant contained in this Section 4 shall be valid unless
            such waiver or modification is approved in writing by the Board.

      f.    Remedies. In the event of a breach, violation or threatened breach
            or violation by Executive of any provision of this Section 4,
            Executive agrees that Employer shall be entitled to relief by
            temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent
            injunction or otherwise, in addition to other legal and equitable
            relief to which it may be entitled, including any and all monetary
            damages which Employer may incur as a result of said breach,
            violation or threatened breach or violation. Employer may pursue any
            remedy available to it concurrently or consecutively in any order as
            to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the
            pursuit of one of such remedies at any time will not be deemed an
            election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other of
            such remedies as to such breach, violation, or threatened breach or
            violation, or as to any other breach, violation, or threatened
            breach or violation.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that Executive's agreement to be
            bound by the protective covenants set forth in this Section 4 was a
            material inducement for Employer entering into this Agreement,
            agreeing to pay Executive the compensation and benefits set forth
            herein, and providing Executive with Employer's Confidential
            Information and other proprietary information.

5.    Termination. The employment relationship between Executive and Employer
      created hereunder shall terminate before the expiration of the stated term
      of this Agreement upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:

      a.    Death or Permanent Disability. The employment relationship shall be
            terminated effective on the death or permanent disability of
            Executive. However, Executive shall be entitled to leaves of absence
            from Employer in accordance with the policy of Employer generally
            applicable to executives for illness or temporary disabilities for a
            period or periods not exceeding three (3) months in any calendar
            year, and his status as an Executive shall continue during such
            periods. However, if Executive qualifies for short-term disability
            payments under Employer's standard short-term disability plan during
            such leave, Executive shall apply to receive such short-term
            disability payments. Employer shall supplement such short term
            disability payments so that Executive receives such monthly amounts
            when combined with the short term disability payments to equal
            Executive's monthly compensation as set forth in Section 3(a) of
            this Agreement. If Executive is incapacitated due to physical or
            mental illness and such incapacity prevents Executive from
            satisfactorily performing his duties for Employer on a full time
            basis for six (6) months or more, Executive shall be deemed to have
            experienced a permanent disability and Employer may terminate this
            Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon the death or
            permanent disability of

            Executive, Executive or his estate (as the case may be) shall be

            below.

      b.    Termination for Cause. The following events, which for purposes of
            this Agreement shall constitute "Cause" for termination:

            i.    Any act of fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement by
                  Executive with respect to any aspect of Employer's business;

            ii.   The breach by Executive of any provision of Sections 1, 2 or 4
                  of this Agreement (including but not limited to a refusal to
                  follow lawful directives of the Board, the Chief Executive
                  Officer or their designees which are not inconsistent with the
                  duties of Executive's position and the provisions of this
                  Agreement);

            iii.  The conviction of Executive by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction of a felony or of a crime involving moral
                  turpitude;

            iv.   The intentional and material breach by Executive of any
                  non-disclosure or non-competition/non-solicitation provision
                  of any agreement to which Executive and Employer or any of its
                  subsidiaries are parties;

            v.    The intentional failure by Executive to perform in all
                  material respects his duties and responsibilities (other than
                  as a result of death or disability) and the failure of
                  Executive to cure the same in all material respects within
                  fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from the Chief
                  Executive Officer or his designee;

            vi.   The illegal use of drugs by Executive during the term of this
                  Agreement that, in the determination of the Board,
                  substantially interferes with Executive's performance of his
                  duties hereunder;

            vii.  Acceptance of employment with any other employer except upon
                  written permission of the Board; or

            viii. The breach by Executive of his fiduciary duty to Employer.

            Employer shall provide Executive with a written notice of
            termination, which can be provided on the date of termination. In
            the event Executive's employment is terminated for Cause hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b) and (c) below.

      c.    Termination by Employer with Notice. Employer may terminate this
            Agreement without Cause at any time upon thirty (30) days written
            notice to Executive, during which period Executive shall not be
            required to perform any services for Employer other than to assist
            Employer in training his successor and generally

            preparing for an orderly transition; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
            Executive shall be entitled to compensation upon such termination as
            provided in Section 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

      d.    Termination by Executive For Good Reason. Executive shall be
            entitled to terminate this Agreement at any time for Good Reason.
            For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
            occurrence of any of the following events:

            i.    Without his express written consent, the assignment of
                  Executive to a position functionally inferior to his position
                  with Employer on the date of this Agreement;

            ii.   The change of the location where Executive is based to a
                  location which is more than fifty (50) miles from his present
                  location without Executive's written consent; or

            iii.  A reduction by Employer in Executive's base salary as in
                  effect on the date hereof, unless such reduction is a
                  proportionate reduction of the compensation of Executive and
                  all other senior officers of Employer as a part of a
                  company-wide effort to enhance the financial condition of
                  Employer.

            Executive shall give Employer thirty (30) business days notice of an
            intent to terminate this Agreement for "Good Reason" as defined in
            this Section 5(d), and provide Employer with ten (10) business days
            after receipt of such notice from Executive to remedy the alleged
            violation of Subsections 5(d)(i), (ii) or (iii). In the event
            Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

6.    Compensation Upon Termination. Upon the termination of Executive's
      employment under this Agreement before the expiration of the stated term
      hereof for any reason, Executive shall be entitled to:

      a.    the salary earned by him before the effective date of termination as
            provided in Section 3(a) hereof (including salary payable during any
            applicable notice period), prorated on the basis of the number of
            full days of service rendered by Executive during the salary payment
            period to the effective date of termination;

      b.    any accrued, but unpaid, vacation benefits; and

      c.    any previously authorized but unreimbursed business expenses.

      If Executive's employment hereunder terminates because of the death or
      permanent disability of Executive, Executive shall be entitled to the
      lesser of (i) the balance of

                                       9

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      Executive's base salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any,
      remaining in the term of this Agreement or (ii) twelve (12) months' base
      salary. In addition, in the event of Executive's permanent disability,
      Executive shall receive continued medical insurance benefits, at
      Employer's expense, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of
      the termination of this Agreement. All amounts that may be due to
      Executive under this Section 6 or Section 5(a) shall be paid to him or his
      administrators, personal representatives, heirs and legatees, as may be
      appropriate.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or other
      plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the time of
      termination of his employment, Executive's rights and benefits under each
      such plan shall be determined in accordance with the terms, conditions,
      and limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
      Executive which may then be in effect.

      d.    Additional Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination Without Cause,
            With Notice or for Good Reason. If Executive's employment hereunder
            terminates without "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), with
            notice pursuant to Section 5(c) above, or for "Good Reason" (as
            defined in Section 5(d) above) Employer shall, upon Executive's
            execution of a general release of claims in favor of Employer,
            provide to Executive in addition to the amounts set forth in
            Subsections 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) above:

            i.    a cash payment equal to the greater of (y) Executive's base
                  salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any, remaining
                  in the term of Executive's Agreement or (z) twelve (12)
                  months' base salary;

            ii.   a cash payment equal to the average annual cash bonus paid to
                  Executive for the two (2) full bonus plan years immediately
                  preceding the date Executive's employment terminates; and

            iii.  continued medical insurance benefits, at Employer's expense,
                  for a period of twelve (12) months.

            Employer shall pay the severance amounts referenced in Section
            6(d)(i) in equal semi-monthly installments for a period of twelve
            (12) months ("Severance Period") in accordance with Employer's
            regular payroll practices. Executive shall have no obligation to
            mitigate any severance obligation of Employer under this Agreement
            by seeking new employment. Employer shall not be entitled to set off
            or reduce any severance payments owed to Executive under this
            Agreement by the amount of earnings or benefits received by
            Executive in future employment. The provisions of Sections 4, 5 and
            6 hereof shall survive the termination of the employment
            relationship hereunder and this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or
            other plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the
            time of termination of his employment, Executive's rights and
            benefits under each such plan shall be

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations
            of the plan and any separate agreement executed by Executive which
            may then be in effect.

      e.    If, during the Severance Period, Executive is in breach of his
            post-employment covenants contained in Section 4 of this Agreement,
            Employer shall not be obligated to pay any severance payments
            referenced herein, Employer's severance obligations shall terminate
            and expire, and Employer shall have no further obligations to
            Executive hereunder from and after the date of such breach and shall
            have all other rights and remedies available under this Agreement or
            any other agreement and at law or in equity.

7.    Compensation Upon Change in Control.

      a.    For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of Employer
            shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as:

            i.    any "person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
                  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
                  "Exchange Act")) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as
                  defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of voting securities of Employer representing more
                  than 50% of Employer's outstanding voting securities or rights
                  to acquire such securities except for any voting securities
                  issued or purchased under any employee benefit plan of
                  Employer or its subsidiaries; or

            ii.   individuals who constitute the Board on the date hereof (the
                  "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least
                  a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a
                  director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was
                  approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors
                  comprising the Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for
                  election by Employer's stockholders was approved by a
                  Nominating Committee solely composed of members which are
                  Incumbent Board members, shall be, for purposes of this clause
                  (ii), considered as though he were a member of the Incumbent
                  Board; or

            iii.  a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all
                  or substantially all of the assets of Employer or similar
                  transaction occurs or is effectuated in which Employer is not
                  the resulting entity; provided, however, that such an event
                  listed above will be deemed to have occurred or to have been
                  effectuated upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals
                  not including the lapse of any required waiting periods; or

            iv.   the Board determines in its sole discretion that a Change in
                  Control has occurred.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      b.    Benefits Upon Change in Control.

            i.    Severance Benefits. If Executive's employment with Employer is
                  terminated (A) by Employer (or by the acquiring or successor
                  business entity following a Change of Control) other than for
                  "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), death or permanent
                  disability, or (B) by Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined
                  in Section 5(d) above) in either event within a period
                  beginning ninety (90) days before, and ending one (1) year
                  after, the date of a Change of Control (the "Change Period"),
                  Executive shall receive a cash severance benefit in an amount
                  equal to the sum of 250% of Executive's average annual cash
                  base salary and bonus in effect for the two (2) years
                  immediately preceding the Change of Control.

                  In addition, for twenty four (24) months following the date of
                  termination of Executive's employment in circumstances in
                  which a severance payment is due under this Section 7(b),
                  Employer shall provide Executive, at Employer's expense,
                  health and other welfare benefits that are not less favorable
                  to Executive than those to which he was entitled immediately
                  prior to the Change in Control. Provided however, Employer
                  shall have no obligation to provide Executive with any
                  severance compensation under this Section 7 if Executive is in
                  breach or violation of any of the covenants contained in
                  Section 4, which are applicable to Executive at the time of
                  the severance payment.

            ii.   Form of Payment. The amount of the severance benefit provided
                  in Section 7(c)(i) hereof shall be paid to Executive in a lump
                  sum within thirty (30) days of Executive's termination, unless
                  such payment must be delayed so as to avoid classification as
                  "deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

            iii.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7, in the
                  event that:

                  (aa)  the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or
                        afforded to Executive, which are deemed to be parachute
                        payments as defined in Code Section 280G or any
                        successor thereof, (the "Termination Benefits") would be
                        deemed to include an "excess parachute payment" under
                        Code Section 280G; and

                  (bb)  if such Termination Benefits were reduced to an amount
                        (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is one
                        dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3)
                        times Executive's "base amount," as determined in
                        accordance with Code Section 280G and the Non-Triggering
                        Amount less the product of the marginal rate of any
                        applicable state and federal income tax and the
                        Non-Triggering Amount would be greater than the
                        aggregate

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                        value of the Termination Benefits (without such
                        reduction) minus (a) the amount of tax required to be
                        paid by Executive thereon by Code Section 4999 and
                        further minus (b) the product of the Termination
                        Benefits and the marginal rate of any applicable state
                        and federal income tax, then the Termination Benefits
                        shall be reduced to the Non-Triggering Amount. The
                        allocation of the reduction required hereby among the
                        Termination Benefits shall be determined by Executive.

            iv.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock
                  options or other plans or programs in which Executive is
                  participating at the time of termination of his employment,
                  Executive's rights and benefits under each such plan shall be
                  determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
                  limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
                  Executive which may then be in effect.

      c.    No Mitigation or Offset. Executive shall not be required to mitigate
            the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 of this
            Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. Employer shall
            not be entitled to set off or reduce any severance payments owed to
            Executive under this Section 7 by the amount of earnings or benefits
            received by Executive in future employment.

8.    Term. This Agreement shall be binding and enforceable against Employer and
      Executive immediately upon its execution by both such parties. The stated
      term of this Agreement and the employment relationship created hereunder
      shall begin on December 20, 2004, and shall remain in effect for two (2)
      years thereafter, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 5
      hereof (the "Initial Employment Term"). This Agreement shall be
      automatically renewed for successive one (1) year terms after the Initial
      Employment Term ("Renewal Term"), unless terminated by either party at
      least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Employment Period
      or any Renewal Term.

      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
      parties' respective rights and obligations under Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7
      shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the
      termination of Executive's employment for any reason whatsoever.

9.    Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
      enforce its rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
      by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise
      all other rights existing in its favor. Notwithstanding Section 10 below,
      the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an
      adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and
      that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or
      equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
      injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the
      provisions of this Agreement.

10.   Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
      Agreement or relating to Executive's rights, compensation and
      responsibilities as an Executive, excluding any claims based on violations
      of Section 4, shall be determined by arbitration in Dallas County, Texas
      in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then
      in effect. The arbitration shall be submitted to a single arbitrator
      selected in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's
      procedures then in effect for the selection of employment arbitrators. The
      parties shall split the cost of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
      the authority to award any remedy that could be awarded by a court of
      competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses and fees
      associated with such arbitration. This Section 10 shall survive
      termination of this Agreement for any reason.

11.   Non-Disparagement. Executive and Employer agree not to make any statements
      that disparage the reputation of (i) Employer, its products, services or
      employees, or (ii) Executive. Executive and Employer further acknowledge
      and agree that any breach or violation of this non-disparagement provision
      shall entitle Executive or Employer to seek injunctive relief to prevent
      any future breaches of this provision and/or to sue the other party on
      this Agreement for the immediate recovery of any damages caused by such
      breach. For purposes of this provision, Employer's obligation shall be
      limited to the Executive Committee of the Board and executives who are
      members of the Employer's Senior Policy Committee.

12.   Assignment. This Agreement is personal to Executive and may not be
      assigned in any way by Executive without the prior written consent of
      Employer. This Agreement shall not be assignable or delegable by Employer,
      other than to an affiliate of Employer; provided, however, that in the
      event of the acquisition, merger or consolidation of Employer, the
      obligations of Employer hereunder shall be binding upon the surviving or
      resulting entity of such acquisition, merger or consolidation. The rights
      and obligations under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
      shall be binding upon the heirs, legatees, administrators and personal
      representatives of Executive and upon the successors, representatives and
      assigns of Employer.

13.   Severability and Reformation. The parties hereto intend all provisions of
      this Agreement to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If,
      however, any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid,
      or unenforceable under present or future law, such provision shall be
      fully severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
      such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision were never a part
      hereof, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect
      and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
      provision or by its severance. In lieu of such illegal, invalid or
      unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of
      this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
      terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
      possible, and Employer and Executive hereby request the court to whom
      disputes relating to this Agreement are submitted to reform the otherwise
      unenforceable covenant in accordance with this Section 13.

<PAGE>

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.3

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      This Executive Employment Agreement (this "Agreement"), effective on the
date hereof, is entered into in Dallas, Texas, by and between Texas Capital
Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business
located at 2100 McKinney Avenue, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas, 75201 ("Employer"),
and C. Keith Cargill ("Executive").

      In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, Employer and
Executive, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.    Employment Relationship. Employer hereby employs Executive, and Executive
      hereby accepts such employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth in
      this Agreement. Such employment relationship shall continue for the stated
      term of this Agreement, as described in Section 8 hereof, unless earlier
      terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

2.    Position and Responsibilities of Executive. Executive shall be employed as
      Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer with job
      responsibilities related thereto, and such job responsibilities may be
      expanded at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer or the
      Board of Directors of Employer ("Board"). Executive shall devote such
      time, skill and attention to the business of Employer as shall be required
      for the efficient management thereof, and shall manage and supervise such
      business, and shall devote his full time best efforts to the faithful
      performance of his duties on behalf of Employer, provided, however,
      Executive may engage in appropriate civic, charitable or religious
      activities and devote a reasonable amount of time to private investments
      or boards or other activities provided that such activities do not
      interfere or conflict with the Executive's responsibilities to Employer
      and are not likely to be contrary to Employer's interests. Executive shall
      also perform such other duties, and may have job responsibilities and
      titles modified from time to time as may be requested by the Chief
      Executive Officer and/or the Board, provided such duties are generally
      consistent with the level of the Executive's current duties. Executive's
      duties shall be performed at Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas. The
      location at which Executive performs his duties shall not be relocated
      more than fifty (50) miles from Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas on the
      date hereof, without Executive's written consent. Executive shall not
      engage in any employment of any kind or undertake any role or position,
      whether or not for compensation, with any person or entity during the term
      of this Agreement without advance written approval of the Chief Executive
      Officer, who shall give notice of Executive's any such request to the
      Executive Committee of the Board, except as otherwise noted above.

3.    Compensation. For all services rendered by Executive pursuant to this
      Agreement, Employer shall pay to Executive, and Executive shall accept as
      full compensation hereunder the following:

      a.    Salary. Executive shall receive a salary of $250,000 per year
            payable by Employer in semi-monthly amounts. Executive's salary
            shall be subject to all appropriate federal and state withholding
            taxes and shall be payable in accordance

                                       1
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            with the normal payroll procedures of Employer. Employer shall not
            reduce Executive's salary without Executive's written consent.
            Employer agrees to consider increasing such base salary at least
            annually during the Initial Employment Term and any Renewal Term (as
            those terms are defined herein), but shall not be obligated to
            effectuate such an increase.

      b.    Benefits and Perquisites. Executive shall be entitled to participate
            in the benefit plans provided by Employer for all employees
            generally, and for executive employees of Employer. Employer shall
            be entitled to change or terminate such plans in its sole
            discretion. The parties acknowledge that at the initial date of this
            Agreement the fringe benefits provided to Executive include a
            corporate 401(k) plan, health, dental, life, short and long-term
            disability insurance, and reimbursement of certain expenses in
            accordance with the policies and procedures of Employer.

      c.    Discretionary Bonuses. The Board shall establish an incentive bonus
            plan for its key executives based on various targets and performance
            criteria to be established by the Board. Executive shall be
            permitted to participate in such plan. The evaluation of the
            performance of Executive as measured by the applicable targets and
            the awarding of applicable bonuses, if any, shall be at the sole
            discretion of the Board. The annual discretionary bonus may be
            awarded in whole or in part, based on the level of incentive bonus
            plan performance criteria achieved by Executive, in the sole
            judgement of the Board. If Executive terminates this Agreement
            without Good Reason, as defined in Section 5(d), or if Employer
            terminates this Agreement at any time for Cause, as defined in
            Section 5(b), Executive will not be paid any Discretionary Bonus, in
            whole or in part.

      d.    Equity Compensation. Employer establishes equity-based incentives
            for its executives from time to time pursuant to its 1999 Omnibus
            Stock Plan and, potentially, such other equity compensation programs
            as may be adopted by Employer in the future (collectively, the
            "Plan"). Employer may, but is not obligated to, make grants of
            equity-based incentive compensation to Executive pursuant to the
            terms of such Plan.

4.    Protective Covenants. Executive recognizes that his employment by Employer
      is one of the highest trust and confidence because (i) Executive has
      become and/or in the future will become familiar with critical aspects of
      Employer's business during the period of his employment with Employer,
      (ii) certain information of which Executive will gain knowledge during his
      employment by Employer is proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret
      information and is of special and peculiar value to Employer, and (iii) if
      any such proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information were
      imparted to or became known by any person, including Executive, engaging
      in a business in competition with that of Employer, hardship, loss and
      irreparable injury and damage could result to Employer, the measurement of
      which would be difficult if not impossible to ascertain. Executive further
      acknowledges that Employer has developed unique concepts, lending
      practices, sales presentations, marketing programs, marketing strategies,
      business

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      practices, methods of operation, pricing information, cost information,
      trademarks, licenses, technical information, proprietary information,
      computer software programs, tapes and disks concerning its operations
      systems, customer lists, customer leads, documents identifying past,
      present and future customers, customer profile and preference data, hiring
      and training methods, investment policies, financial and other
      confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information concerning its
      operations and expansion plans ("Confidential Information"). Therefore,
      Executive agrees that it is necessary for Employer to protect its business
      and that of its affiliates from such damage, and Executive further agrees
      that the following covenants constitute a reasonable and appropriate
      means, consistent with the best interest of both Executive and Employer,
      to protect Employer or its affiliates against damage due to loss or
      disclosure of Confidential Information and shall apply to and be binding
      upon Executive as provided herein:

      a.    Confidential Information. Employer agrees to provide Executive with
            some or all of its Confidential Information (as defined above)
            during the term of this Agreement (as set forth in Section 8 below).
            Executive recognizes that his position with Employer is one of the
            highest trust and confidence by reason of Executive's access to and
            contact with certain Confidential Information of Employer. Executive
            agrees and covenants that, except as may be required by Employer in
            connection with this Agreement, or with the prior written consent of
            Employer, Executive shall not, either during the term of this
            Agreement or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, use for
            Executive's own benefit or for the benefit of another, or disclose,
            disseminate, or distribute to another, except as directed by
            Employer or as required for the performance of Executive's duties on
            behalf of Employer, any Confidential Information (whether or not
            acquired, learned, obtained, or developed by Executive alone or in
            conjunction with others) of Employer or of others with whom Employer
            has a business relationship, provided, however that this restriction
            shall not apply to truthful testimony given under oath in a legal
            proceeding by Executive pursuant to a properly issued subpoena if
            Executive provides timely notice of such subpoena to Employer. All
            Confidential Information, and all memoranda, notes, records,
            drawings, documents, or other writings whatsoever made, compiled,
            acquired, or received by Executive at any time during his employment
            with Employer, including during the term of this Agreement, arising
            out of, in connection with, or related to any activity or business
            of Employer, including, but not limited to, the customers,
            suppliers, or others with whom Employer has a business relationship,
            the arrangements of Employer with such parties, and the pricing and
            expansion policies and strategy of Employer, are, and shall continue
            to be, the sole and exclusive property of Employer and shall,
            together with all copies thereof, and any and all documents
            constituting or relating to Employer's Confidential Information, be
            delivered to Employer by Executive immediately, without demand, upon
            the termination of this Agreement, or at any time upon Employer's
            demand.

                  Executive acknowledges that Employer would not employ
            Executive or provide Executive access to Employer's Confidential
            Information and proprietary

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            information but for Executive's covenants and promises contained in
            this Section 4.

                  Executive represents and warrants that he is not bound by any
            agreement with any prior employer or other party that will be
            breached by execution and performance of this Agreement, or which
            would otherwise prevent him from performing his duties with Employer
            as set forth in this Agreement. Executive represents and warrants
            that he has not retained any copies of proprietary or confidential
            information of any prior employer, and he will not use or rely on
            any confidential and proprietary information of any prior employer
            in carrying out his duties for Employer.

      b.    Covenant Not to Compete. In consideration of the numerous mutual
            promises and agreements contained in this Agreement between Employer
            and Executive, including, without limitation, those involving
            Confidential Information, and in order to protect Employer's
            Confidential Information and to reduce the likelihood of irreparable
            damage which would occur in the event such information is provided
            to or used by a competitor of Employer, Executive agrees that during
            his employment and for an additional period of twelve (12) months
            immediately following the termination of his employment, whether
            voluntary or involuntary (the "Noncompetition Term"), not to,
            directly or indirectly, either through any form of ownership or as
            an individual, director, officer, principal, agent, employee,
            employer, adviser, consultant, shareholder, partner, member, or in
            any individual or representative capacity whatsoever, without the
            prior written consent of Employer (which consent may be withheld in
            its sole discretion), (i) compete for or solicit business for or on
            behalf of any person or business entity operating a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services with a place of
            business in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana;
            (ii) own, operate, participate in, undertake any employment with or
            have any interest in any entity with a place of business in Texas,
            New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana related to the
            operation of a state or national bank or company providing similar
            services, except owning publicly traded stock for investment
            purposes only in which Executive owns less than 5%, (iii) compete
            for or solicit business related to the operation of a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services from any
            customer of Employer (or its successors by merger); or (iv) use in
            any competition, solicitation, or marketing effort any Confidential
            Information, any proprietary list, or any information concerning
            customers of Employer.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that the geographic boundaries,
            scope of prohibited activities and the time duration of the
            provisions of this Section 4 are reasonable and are no broader than
            are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of
            Employer. This noncompetition provision shall survive the
            termination of Executive's employment and can only be revoked or
            modified by a writing signed by the parties that specifically states
            an intent to revoke or modify this provision. Executive acknowledges
            that Employer would not employ him or

                                       4

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            provide him with access to its Confidential Information but for his
            covenants or promises contained in this Section.

                  Employer and Executive agree and stipulate that the agreements
            and covenants not to compete contained in this Section 4 hereof are
            fair and reasonable in light of all of the facts and circumstances
            of the relationship between Executive and Employer; however,
            Executive and Employer are aware that in certain circumstances
            courts have refused to enforce certain terms of agreements not to
            compete. Therefore, in furtherance of, and not in derogation of the
            provisions of this Section 4, Employer and Executive agree that in
            the event a court should decline to enforce any terms of any of the
            provisions of this Section 4, that Section 4 shall be deemed to be
            modified or reformed to restrict Executive's competition with
            Employer or its affiliates to the maximum extent, as to time,
            geography and business scope, which the court shall find
            enforceable; provided, however, in no event shall the provisions of
            this Section 4 be deemed to be more restrictive to Executive than
            those contained herein.

                  Executive agrees that during the Noncompetition Term, he shall
            immediately notify Employer in writing of any employment, work or
            business he undertakes with or on behalf of any person (including
            himself) or entity.

      c.    Non-Solicitation. Executive agrees that during his employment, and
            for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of his
            employment, for whatever reason, that neither he nor any individual,
            partner(s), limited partnership, corporation or other entity or
            business with which he is in any way affiliated, including, without
            limitation, any partner, limited partner, member, director, officer,
            shareholder, employee, or agent of any such entity or business, will
            (i) request, induce or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly,
            any employee of Employer to terminate their employment with Employer
            or (ii) employ any person who as of the date of this Agreement was,
            or after such date, is an employee of Employer. Executive further
            agrees that during the period beginning with the commencement of
            Executive's employment with Employer and ending twelve (12) months
            after the termination of Executive's employment with Employer, for
            whatever reason, he shall not, directly or indirectly, as an
            individual, employee, agent, consultant, stockholder, director,
            partner or in any other individual or representative capacity of
            Employer or of any other person, entity or business, solicit or
            encourage any present or future customer, supplier, contractor,
            partner or investor of Employer to terminate, limit or otherwise
            alter his, her or its relationship with Employer.

      d.    Work Product. For purposes of this Section 4, "Work Product" shall
            mean all intellectual property rights, including all trade secrets,
            U.S. and international copyrights, patentable inventions,
            discoveries and other intellectual property rights in any
            programming, design, documentation, technology, or other work
            product that is created in connection with Executive's work. In
            addition, all rights in any preexisting programming, design,
            documentation, technology, or other

                                       5

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            Work Product provided to Employer during Executive's employment
            shall automatically become part of the Work Product hereunder,
            whether or not it arises specifically out of Executive's "Work." For
            purposes of this Agreement, "Work" shall mean (i) any direct
            assignments and required performance by or for Employer, and (ii)
            any other productive output that relates to the business of Employer
            and is produced during the course of Executive's employment or
            engagement by Employer. For this purpose, Work may be considered
            present even after normal working hours, away from Employer's
            premises, on an unsupervised basis, alone or with others. Unless
            otherwise approved in writing by the Board, this Agreement shall
            apply to all Work Product created in connection with all Work
            conducted before or after the date of this Agreement.

                  Employer shall own all rights in the Work Product. To this
            end, all Work Product shall be considered work made for hire for
            Employer. If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law or
            agreement, be considered Work made by Executive for hire for
            Employer (or if ownership of all rights therein do not otherwise
            vest exclusively in Employer immediately), Executive agrees to
            assign, and upon creation thereof does hereby automatically assign,
            without further consideration, the ownership thereof to Employer.
            Executive hereby irrevocably relinquishes for the benefit of
            Employer and its assigns any moral rights in the Work Product
            recognized by applicable law. Employer shall have the right to
            obtain and hold, in whatever name or capacity it selects,
            copyrights, registrations, and any other protection available in the
            Work Product.

                  Executive agrees to perform upon the request of Employer,
            during or after Executive's Work or employment, such further acts as
            may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend
            Employer's ownership of the Work Product, including by (i)
            executing, acknowledging, and delivering any requested affidavits
            and documents of assignment and conveyance, (ii) obtaining and/or
            aiding in the enforcement of copyrights, trade secrets, and (if
            applicable) patents with respect to the Work Product in any
            countries, and (iii) providing testimony in connection with any
            proceeding affecting the rights of Employer in any Work Product. In
            the event that Executive is required to perform the services
            described in this paragraph after his employment with the Employer
            has terminated, Executive will be reasonably compensated for actual
            time spent providing such services.

                  Executive warrants that his Work for Employer does not and
            will not in any way conflict with any obligations Executive may have
            with any prior employer or contractor. Executive also agrees to
            develop all Work Product in a manner that avoids even the appearance
            of infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights.

      e.    Survival of Covenants. Each covenant of Executive set forth in this
            Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
            Executive's employment for any reason and shall be construed as an
            agreement independent of any other

                                       6
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause
            of action of Executive against Employer whether predicated on this
            Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a defense to the
            enforcement by Employer of said covenant. No modification or waiver
            of any covenant contained in this Section 4 shall be valid unless
            such waiver or modification is approved in writing by the Board.

      f.    Remedies. In the event of a breach, violation or threatened breach
            or violation by Executive of any provision of this Section 4,
            Executive agrees that Employer shall be entitled to relief by
            temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent
            injunction or otherwise, in addition to other legal and equitable
            relief to which it may be entitled, including any and all monetary
            damages which Employer may incur as a result of said breach,
            violation or threatened breach or violation. Employer may pursue any
            remedy available to it concurrently or consecutively in any order as
            to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the
            pursuit of one of such remedies at any time will not be deemed an
            election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other of
            such remedies as to such breach, violation, or threatened breach or
            violation, or as to any other breach, violation, or threatened
            breach or violation.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that Executive's agreement to be
            bound by the protective covenants set forth in this Section 4 was a
            material inducement for Employer entering into this Agreement,
            agreeing to pay Executive the compensation and benefits set forth
            herein, and providing Executive with Employer's Confidential
            Information and other proprietary information.

5.    Termination. The employment relationship between Executive and Employer
      created hereunder shall terminate before the expiration of the stated term
      of this Agreement upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:

      a.    Death or Permanent Disability. The employment relationship shall be
            terminated effective on the death or permanent disability of
            Executive. However, Executive shall be entitled to leaves of absence
            from Employer in accordance with the policy of Employer generally
            applicable to executives for illness or temporary disabilities for a
            period or periods not exceeding three (3) months in any calendar
            year, and his status as an Executive shall continue during such
            periods. However, if Executive qualifies for short-term disability
            payments under Employer's standard short-term disability plan during
            such leave, Executive shall apply to receive such short-term
            disability payments. Employer shall supplement such short term
            disability payments so that Executive receives such monthly amounts
            when combined with the short term disability payments to equal
            Executive's monthly compensation as set forth in Section 3(a) of
            this Agreement. If Executive is incapacitated due to physical or
            mental illness and such incapacity prevents Executive from
            satisfactorily performing his duties for Employer on a full time
            basis for six (6) months or more, Executive shall be deemed to have
            experienced a permanent disability and Employer may terminate this
            Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon the death or
            permanent disability of

            Executive, Executive or his estate (as the case may be) shall be
            entitled to compensation as provided in Sections 6(a), (b) and (c)
            below.

      b.    Termination for Cause. The following events, which for purposes of
            this Agreement shall constitute "Cause" for termination:

            i.    Any act of fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement by
                  Executive with respect to any aspect of Employer's business;

            ii.   The breach by Executive of any provision of Sections 1, 2 or 4
                  of this Agreement (including but not limited to a refusal to
                  follow lawful directives of the Board, the Chief Executive
                  Officer or their designees which are not inconsistent with the
                  duties of Executive's position and the provisions of this
                  Agreement);

            iii.  The conviction of Executive by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction of a felony or of a crime involving moral
                  turpitude;

            iv.   The intentional and material breach by Executive of any
                  non-disclosure or non-competition/non-solicitation provision
                  of any agreement to which Executive and Employer or any of its
                  subsidiaries are parties;

            v.    The intentional failure by Executive to perform in all
                  material respects his duties and responsibilities (other than
                  as a result of death or disability) and the failure of
                  Executive to cure the same in all material respects within
                  fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from the Chief
                  Executive Officer or his designee;

            vi.   The illegal use of drugs by Executive during the term of this
                  Agreement that, in the determination of the Board,
                  substantially interferes with Executive's performance of his
                  duties hereunder;

            vii.  Acceptance of employment with any other employer except upon
                  written permission of the Board; or

            viii. The breach by Executive of his fiduciary duty to Employer.

            Employer shall provide Executive with a written notice of
            termination, which can be provided on the date of termination. In
            the event Executive's employment is terminated for Cause hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b) and (c) below.

      c.    Termination by Employer with Notice. Employer may terminate this
            Agreement without Cause at any time upon thirty (30) days written
            notice to Executive, during which period Executive shall not be
            required to perform any services for Employer other than to assist
            Employer in training his successor and generally

                                       8

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            preparing for an orderly transition; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
            Executive shall be entitled to compensation upon such termination as
            provided in Section 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

      d.    Termination by Executive For Good Reason. Executive shall be
            entitled to terminate this Agreement at any time for Good Reason.
            For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
            occurrence of any of the following events:

            i.    Without his express written consent, the assignment of
                  Executive to a position functionally inferior to his position
                  with Employer on the date of this Agreement;

            ii.   The change of the location where Executive is based to a
                  location which is more than fifty (50) miles from his present
                  location without Executive's written consent; or

            iii.  A reduction by Employer in Executive's base salary as in
                  effect on the date hereof, unless such reduction is a
                  proportionate reduction of the compensation of Executive and
                  all other senior officers of Employer as a part of a
                  company-wide effort to enhance the financial condition of
                  Employer.

            Executive shall give Employer thirty (30) business days notice of an
            intent to terminate this Agreement for "Good Reason" as defined in
            this Section 5(d), and provide Employer with ten (10) business days
            after receipt of such notice from Executive to remedy the alleged
            violation of Subsections 5(d)(i), (ii) or (iii). In the event
            Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

6.    Compensation Upon Termination. Upon the termination of Executive's
      employment under this Agreement before the expiration of the stated term
      hereof for any reason, Executive shall be entitled to:

      a.    the salary earned by him before the effective date of termination as
            provided in Section 3(a) hereof (including salary payable during any
            applicable notice period), prorated on the basis of the number of
            full days of service rendered by Executive during the salary payment
            period to the effective date of termination;

      b.    any accrued, but unpaid, vacation benefits; and

      c.    any previously authorized but unreimbursed business expenses.

      If Executive's employment hereunder terminates because of the death or
      permanent disability of Executive, Executive shall be entitled to the
      lesser of (i) the balance of

                                       9
<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      Executive's base salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any,
      remaining in the term of this Agreement or (ii) twelve (12) months' base
      salary. In addition, in the event of Executive's permanent disability,
      Executive shall receive continued medical insurance benefits, at
      Employer's expense, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of
      the termination of this Agreement. All amounts that may be due to
      Executive under this Section 6 or Section 5(a) shall be paid to him or his
      administrators, personal representatives, heirs and legatees, as may be
      appropriate.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or other
      plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the time of
      termination of his employment, Executive's rights and benefits under each
      such plan shall be determined in accordance with the terms, conditions,
      and limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
      Executive which may then be in effect.

      d.    Additional Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination Without Cause,
            With Notice or for Good Reason. If Executive's employment hereunder
            terminates without "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), with
            notice pursuant to Section 5(c) above, or for "Good Reason" (as
            defined in Section 5(d) above) Employer shall, upon Executive's
            execution of a general release of claims in favor of Employer,
            provide to Executive in addition to the amounts set forth in
            Subsections 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) above:

            i.    a cash payment equal to the greater of (y) Executive's base
                  salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any, remaining
                  in the term of Executive's Agreement or (z) twelve (12)
                  months' base salary;

            ii.   a cash payment equal to the average annual cash bonus paid to
                  Executive for the two (2) full bonus plan years immediately
                  preceding the date Executive's employment terminates; and

            iii.  continued medical insurance benefits, at Employer's expense,
                  for a period of twelve (12) months.

            Employer shall pay the severance amounts referenced in Section
            6(d)(i) in equal semi-monthly installments for a period of twelve
            (12) months ("Severance Period") in accordance with Employer's
            regular payroll practices. Executive shall have no obligation to
            mitigate any severance obligation of Employer under this Agreement
            by seeking new employment. Employer shall not be entitled to set off
            or reduce any severance payments owed to Executive under this
            Agreement by the amount of earnings or benefits received by
            Executive in future employment. The provisions of Sections 4, 5 and
            6 hereof shall survive the termination of the employment
            relationship hereunder and this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or
            other plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the
            time of termination of his employment, Executive's rights and
            benefits under each such plan shall be

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations
            of the plan and any separate agreement executed by Executive which
            may then be in effect.

      e.    If, during the Severance Period, Executive is in breach of his
            post-employment covenants contained in Section 4 of this Agreement,
            Employer shall not be obligated to pay any severance payments
            referenced herein, Employer's severance obligations shall terminate
            and expire, and Employer shall have no further obligations to
            Executive hereunder from and after the date of such breach and shall
            have all other rights and remedies available under this Agreement or
            any other agreement and at law or in equity.

7.    Compensation Upon Change in Control.

      a.    For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of Employer
            shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as:

            i.    any "person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
                  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
                  "Exchange Act")) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as
                  defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of voting securities of Employer representing more
                  than 50% of Employer's outstanding voting securities or rights
                  to acquire such securities except for any voting securities
                  issued or purchased under any employee benefit plan of
                  Employer or its subsidiaries; or

            ii.   individuals who constitute the Board on the date hereof (the
                  "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least
                  a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a
                  director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was
                  approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors
                  comprising the Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for
                  election by Employer's stockholders was approved by a
                  Nominating Committee solely composed of members which are
                  Incumbent Board members, shall be, for purposes of this clause
                  (ii), considered as though he were a member of the Incumbent
                  Board; or

            iii.  a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all
                  or substantially all of the assets of Employer or similar
                  transaction occurs or is effectuated in which Employer is not
                  the resulting entity; provided, however, that such an event
                  listed above will be deemed to have occurred or to have been
                  effectuated upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals
                  not including the lapse of any required waiting periods; or

            iv.   the Board determines in its sole discretion that a Change in
                  Control has occurred.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      b.    Benefits Upon Change in Control.

            i.    Severance Benefits. If Executive's employment with Employer is
                  terminated (A) by Employer (or by the acquiring or successor
                  business entity following a Change of Control) other than for
                  "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), death or permanent
                  disability, or (B) by Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined
                  in Section 5(d) above) in either event within a period
                  beginning ninety (90) days before, and ending one (1) year
                  after, the date of a Change of Control (the "Change Period"),
                  Executive shall receive a cash severance benefit in an amount
                  equal to the sum of 250% of Executive's average annual cash
                  base salary and bonus in effect for the two (2) years
                  immediately preceding the Change of Control.

                  In addition, for twenty four (24) months following the date of
                  termination of Executive's employment in circumstances in
                  which a severance payment is due under this Section 7(b),
                  Employer shall provide Executive, at Employer's expense,
                  health and other welfare benefits that are not less favorable
                  to Executive than those to which he was entitled immediately
                  prior to the Change in Control. Provided however, Employer
                  shall have no obligation to provide Executive with any
                  severance compensation under this Section 7 if Executive is in
                  breach or violation of any of the covenants contained in
                  Section 4, which are applicable to Executive at the time of
                  the severance payment.

            ii.   Form of Payment. The amount of the severance benefit provided
                  in Section 7(c)(i) hereof shall be paid to Executive in a lump
                  sum within thirty (30) days of Executive's termination, unless
                  such payment must be delayed so as to avoid classification as
                  "deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

            iii.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7, in the
                  event that:

                  (aa)  the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or
                        afforded to Executive, which are deemed to be parachute
                        payments as defined in Code Section 280G or any
                        successor thereof, (the "Termination Benefits") would be
                        deemed to include an "excess parachute payment" under
                        Code Section 280G; and

                  (bb)  if such Termination Benefits were reduced to an amount
                        (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is one
                        dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3)
                        times Executive's "base amount," as determined in
                        accordance with Code Section 280G and the Non-Triggering
                        Amount less the product of the marginal rate of any
                        applicable state and federal income tax and the
                        Non-Triggering Amount would be greater than the
                        aggregate

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                        value of the Termination Benefits (without such
                        reduction) minus (a) the amount of tax required to be
                        paid by Executive thereon by Code Section 4999 and
                        further minus (b) the product of the Termination
                        Benefits and the marginal rate of any applicable state
                        and federal income tax, then the Termination Benefits
                        shall be reduced to the Non-Triggering Amount. The
                        allocation of the reduction required hereby among the
                        Termination Benefits shall be determined by Executive.

            iv.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock
                  options or other plans or programs in which Executive is
                  participating at the time of termination of his employment,
                  Executive's rights and benefits under each such plan shall be
                  determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
                  limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
                  Executive which may then be in effect.

      c.    No Mitigation or Offset. Executive shall not be required to mitigate
            the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 of this
            Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. Employer shall
            not be entitled to set off or reduce any severance payments owed to
            Executive under this Section 7 by the amount of earnings or benefits
            received by Executive in future employment.

8.    Term. This Agreement shall be binding and enforceable against Employer and
      Executive immediately upon its execution by both such parties. The stated
      term of this Agreement and the employment relationship created hereunder
      shall begin on December 20, 2004, and shall remain in effect for two (2)
      years thereafter, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 5
      hereof (the "Initial Employment Term"). This Agreement shall be
      automatically renewed for successive one (1) year terms after the Initial
      Employment Term ("Renewal Term"), unless terminated by either party at
      least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Employment Period
      or any Renewal Term.

      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
      parties' respective rights and obligations under Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7
      shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the
      termination of Executive's employment for any reason whatsoever.

9.    Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
      enforce its rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
      by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise
      all other rights existing in its favor. Notwithstanding Section 10 below,
      the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an
      adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and
      that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or
      equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
      injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the
      provisions of this Agreement.

10.   Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
      Agreement or relating to Executive's rights, compensation and
      responsibilities as an Executive, excluding any claims based on violations
      of Section 4, shall be determined by arbitration in Dallas County, Texas
      in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then
      in effect. The arbitration shall be submitted to a single arbitrator
      selected in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's
      procedures then in effect for the selection of employment arbitrators. The
      parties shall split the cost of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
      the authority to award any remedy that could be awarded by a court of
      competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses and fees
      associated with such arbitration. This Section 10 shall survive
      termination of this Agreement for any reason.

11.   Non-Disparagement. Executive and Employer agree not to make any statements
      that disparage the reputation of (i) Employer, its products, services or
      employees, or (ii) Executive. Executive and Employer further acknowledge
      and agree that any breach or violation of this non-disparagement provision
      shall entitle Executive or Employer to seek injunctive relief to prevent
      any future breaches of this provision and/or to sue the other party on
      this Agreement for the immediate recovery of any damages caused by such
      breach. For purposes of this provision, Employer's obligation shall be
      limited to the Executive Committee of the Board and executives who are
      members of the Employer's Senior Policy Committee.

12.   Assignment. This Agreement is personal to Executive and may not be
      assigned in any way by Executive without the prior written consent of
      Employer. This Agreement shall not be assignable or delegable by Employer,
      other than to an affiliate of Employer; provided, however, that in the
      event of the acquisition, merger or consolidation of Employer, the
      obligations of Employer hereunder shall be binding upon the surviving or
      resulting entity of such acquisition, merger or consolidation. The rights
      and obligations under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
      shall be binding upon the heirs, legatees, administrators and personal
      representatives of Executive and upon the successors, representatives and
      assigns of Employer.

13.   Severability and Reformation. The parties hereto intend all provisions of
      this Agreement to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If,
      however, any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid,
      or unenforceable under present or future law, such provision shall be
      fully severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
      such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision were never a part
      hereof, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect
      and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
      provision or by its severance. In lieu of such illegal, invalid or
      unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of
      this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
      terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
      possible, and Employer and Executive hereby request the court to whom
      disputes relating to this Agreement are submitted to reform the otherwise
      unenforceable covenant in accordance with this Section 13.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                         EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      This Executive Employment Agreement (this "Agreement"), effective on the
date hereof, is entered into in Dallas, Texas, by and between Texas Capital
Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business
located at 2100 McKinney Avenue, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas, 75201 ("Employer"),
and Peter B. Bartholow ("Executive").

      In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, Employer and
Executive, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.    Employment Relationship. Employer hereby employs Executive, and Executive
      hereby accepts such employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth in
      this Agreement. Such employment relationship shall continue for the stated
      term of this Agreement, as described in Section 8 hereof, unless earlier
      terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

2.    Position and Responsibilities of Executive. Executive shall be employed as
      Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer with job
      responsibilities related thereto, and such job responsibilities may be
      expanded at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer or the
      Board of Directors of Employer ("Board"). Executive shall devote such
      time, skill and attention to the business of Employer as shall be required
      for the efficient management thereof, and shall manage and supervise such
      business, and shall devote his full time best efforts to the faithful
      performance of his duties on behalf of Employer, provided, however,
      Executive may engage in appropriate civic, charitable or religious
      activities and devote a reasonable amount of time to private investments
      or boards or other activities provided that such activities do not
      interfere or conflict with the Executive's responsibilities to Employer
      and are not likely to be contrary to Employer's interests. Executive shall
      also perform such other duties, and may have job responsibilities and
      titles modified from time to time as may be requested by the Chief
      Executive Officer and/or the Board, provided such duties are generally
      consistent with the level of the Executive's current duties. Executive's
      duties shall be performed at Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas. The
      location at which Executive performs his duties shall not be relocated
      more than fifty (50) miles from Employer's offices in Dallas, Texas on the
      date hereof, without Executive's written consent. Executive shall not
      engage in any employment of any kind or undertake any role or position,
      whether or not for compensation, with any person or entity during the term
      of this Agreement without advance written approval of the Chief Executive
      Officer, who shall give notice of Executive's any such request to the
      Executive Committee of the Board, except as otherwise noted above.

3.    Compensation. For all services rendered by Executive pursuant to this
      Agreement, Employer shall pay to Executive, and Executive shall accept as
      full compensation hereunder the following:

      a.    Salary. Executive shall receive a salary of $250,000 per year
            payable by Employer in semi-monthly amounts. Executive's salary
            shall be subject to all appropriate federal and state withholding
            taxes and shall be payable in accordance

                                       1

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            with the normal payroll procedures of Employer. Employer shall not
            reduce Executive's salary without Executive's written consent.
            Employer agrees to consider increasing such base salary at least
            annually during the Initial Employment Term and any Renewal Term (as
            those terms are defined herein), but shall not be obligated to
            effectuate such an increase.

      b.    Benefits and Perquisites. Executive shall be entitled to participate
            in the benefit plans provided by Employer for all employees
            generally, and for executive employees of Employer. Employer shall
            be entitled to change or terminate such plans in its sole
            discretion. The parties acknowledge that at the initial date of this
            Agreement the fringe benefits provided to Executive include a
            corporate 401(k) plan, health, dental, life, short and long-term
            disability insurance, and reimbursement of certain expenses in
            accordance with the policies and procedures of Employer.

      c.    Discretionary Bonuses. The Board shall establish an incentive bonus
            plan for its key executives based on various targets and performance
            criteria to be established by the Board. Executive shall be
            permitted to participate in such plan. The evaluation of the
            performance of Executive as measured by the applicable targets and
            the awarding of applicable bonuses, if any, shall be at the sole
            discretion of the Board. The annual discretionary bonus may be
            awarded in whole or in part, based on the level of incentive bonus
            plan performance criteria achieved by Executive, in the sole
            judgement of the Board. If Executive terminates this Agreement
            without Good Reason, as defined in Section 5(d), or if Employer
            terminates this Agreement at any time for Cause, as defined in
            Section 5(b), Executive will not be paid any Discretionary Bonus, in
            whole or in part.

      d.    Equity Compensation. Employer establishes equity-based incentives
            for its executives from time to time pursuant to its 1999 Omnibus
            Stock Plan and, potentially, such other equity compensation programs
            as may be adopted by Employer in the future (collectively, the
            "Plan"). Employer may, but is not obligated to, make grants of
            equity-based incentive compensation to Executive pursuant to the
            terms of such Plan.

4.    Protective Covenants. Executive recognizes that his employment by Employer
      is one of the highest trust and confidence because (i) Executive has
      become and/or in the future will become familiar with critical aspects of
      Employer's business during the period of his employment with Employer,
      (ii) certain information of which Executive will gain knowledge during his
      employment by Employer is proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret
      information and is of special and peculiar value to Employer, and (iii) if
      any such proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information were
      imparted to or became known by any person, including Executive, engaging
      in a business in competition with that of Employer, hardship, loss and
      irreparable injury and damage could result to Employer, the measurement of
      which would be difficult if not impossible to ascertain. Executive further
      acknowledges that Employer has developed unique concepts, lending
      practices, sales presentations, marketing programs, marketing strategies,
      business

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      practices, methods of operation, pricing information, cost information,
      trademarks, licenses, technical information, proprietary information,
      computer software programs, tapes and disks concerning its operations
      systems, customer lists, customer leads, documents identifying past,
      present and future customers, customer profile and preference data, hiring
      and training methods, investment policies, financial and other
      confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information concerning its
      operations and expansion plans ("Confidential Information"). Therefore,
      Executive agrees that it is necessary for Employer to protect its business
      and that of its affiliates from such damage, and Executive further agrees
      that the following covenants constitute a reasonable and appropriate
      means, consistent with the best interest of both Executive and Employer,
      to protect Employer or its affiliates against damage due to loss or
      disclosure of Confidential Information and shall apply to and be binding
      upon Executive as provided herein:

      a.    Confidential Information. Employer agrees to provide Executive with
            some or all of its Confidential Information (as defined above)
            during the term of this Agreement (as set forth in Section 8 below).
            Executive recognizes that his position with Employer is one of the
            highest trust and confidence by reason of Executive's access to and
            contact with certain Confidential Information of Employer. Executive
            agrees and covenants that, except as may be required by Employer in
            connection with this Agreement, or with the prior written consent of
            Employer, Executive shall not, either during the term of this
            Agreement or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, use for
            Executive's own benefit or for the benefit of another, or disclose,
            disseminate, or distribute to another, except as directed by
            Employer or as required for the performance of Executive's duties on
            behalf of Employer, any Confidential Information (whether or not
            acquired, learned, obtained, or developed by Executive alone or in
            conjunction with others) of Employer or of others with whom Employer
            has a business relationship, provided, however that this restriction
            shall not apply to truthful testimony given under oath in a legal
            proceeding by Executive pursuant to a properly issued subpoena if
            Executive provides timely notice of such subpoena to Employer. All
            Confidential Information, and all memoranda, notes, records,
            drawings, documents, or other writings whatsoever made, compiled,
            acquired, or received by Executive at any time during his employment
            with Employer, including during the term of this Agreement, arising
            out of, in connection with, or related to any activity or business
            of Employer, including, but not limited to, the customers,
            suppliers, or others with whom Employer has a business relationship,
            the arrangements of Employer with such parties, and the pricing and
            expansion policies and strategy of Employer, are, and shall continue
            to be, the sole and exclusive property of Employer and shall,
            together with all copies thereof, and any and all documents
            constituting or relating to Employer's Confidential Information, be
            delivered to Employer by Executive immediately, without demand, upon
            the termination of this Agreement, or at any time upon Employer's
            demand.

                  Executive acknowledges that Employer would not employ
            Executive or provide Executive access to Employer's Confidential
            Information and proprietary

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            information but for Executive's covenants and promises contained in
            this Section 4.

                  Executive represents and warrants that he is not bound by any
            agreement with any prior employer or other party that will be
            breached by execution and performance of this Agreement, or which
            would otherwise prevent him from performing his duties with Employer
            as set forth in this Agreement. Executive represents and warrants
            that he has not retained any copies of proprietary or confidential
            information of any prior employer, and he will not use or rely on
            any confidential and proprietary information of any prior employer
            in carrying out his duties for Employer.

      b.    Covenant Not to Compete. In consideration of the numerous mutual
            promises and agreements contained in this Agreement between Employer
            and Executive, including, without limitation, those involving
            Confidential Information, and in order to protect Employer's
            Confidential Information and to reduce the likelihood of irreparable
            damage which would occur in the event such information is provided
            to or used by a competitor of Employer, Executive agrees that during
            his employment and for an additional period of twelve (12) months
            immediately following the termination of his employment, whether
            voluntary or involuntary (the "Noncompetition Term"), not to,
            directly or indirectly, either through any form of ownership or as
            an individual, director, officer, principal, agent, employee,
            employer, adviser, consultant, shareholder, partner, member, or in
            any individual or representative capacity whatsoever, without the
            prior written consent of Employer (which consent may be withheld in
            its sole discretion), (i) compete for or solicit business for or on
            behalf of any person or business entity operating a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services with a place of
            business in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana;
            (ii) own, operate, participate in, undertake any employment with or
            have any interest in any entity with a place of business in Texas,
            New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana related to the
            operation of a state or national bank or company providing similar
            services, except owning publicly traded stock for investment
            purposes only in which Executive owns less than 5%, (iii) compete
            for or solicit business related to the operation of a state or
            national bank or company providing similar services from any
            customer of Employer (or its successors by merger); or (iv) use in
            any competition, solicitation, or marketing effort any Confidential
            Information, any proprietary list, or any information concerning
            customers of Employer.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that the geographic boundaries,
            scope of prohibited activities and the time duration of the
            provisions of this Section 4 are reasonable and are no broader than
            are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of
            Employer. This noncompetition provision shall survive the
            termination of Executive's employment and can only be revoked or
            modified by a writing signed by the parties that specifically states
            an intent to revoke or modify this provision. Executive acknowledges
            that Employer would not employ him or

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            provide him with access to its Confidential Information but for his
            covenants or promises contained in this Section.

                  Employer and Executive agree and stipulate that the agreements
            and covenants not to compete contained in this Section 4 hereof are
            fair and reasonable in light of all of the facts and circumstances
            of the relationship between Executive and Employer; however,
            Executive and Employer are aware that in certain circumstances
            courts have refused to enforce certain terms of agreements not to
            compete. Therefore, in furtherance of, and not in derogation of the
            provisions of this Section 4, Employer and Executive agree that in
            the event a court should decline to enforce any terms of any of the
            provisions of this Section 4, that Section 4 shall be deemed to be
            modified or reformed to restrict Executive's competition with
            Employer or its affiliates to the maximum extent, as to time,
            geography and business scope, which the court shall find
            enforceable; provided, however, in no event shall the provisions of
            this Section 4 be deemed to be more restrictive to Executive than
            those contained herein.

                  Executive agrees that during the Noncompetition Term, he shall
            immediately notify Employer in writing of any employment, work or
            business he undertakes with or on behalf of any person (including
            himself) or entity.

      c.    Non-Solicitation. Executive agrees that during his employment, and
            for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of his
            employment, for whatever reason, that neither he nor any individual,
            partner(s), limited partnership, corporation or other entity or
            business with which he is in any way affiliated, including, without
            limitation, any partner, limited partner, member, director, officer,
            shareholder, employee, or agent of any such entity or business, will
            (i) request, induce or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly,
            any employee of Employer to terminate their employment with Employer
            or (ii) employ any person who as of the date of this Agreement was,
            or after such date, is an employee of Employer. Executive further
            agrees that during the period beginning with the commencement of
            Executive's employment with Employer and ending twelve (12) months
            after the termination of Executive's employment with Employer, for
            whatever reason, he shall not, directly or indirectly, as an
            individual, employee, agent, consultant, stockholder, director,
            partner or in any other individual or representative capacity of
            Employer or of any other person, entity or business, solicit or
            encourage any present or future customer, supplier, contractor,
            partner or investor of Employer to terminate, limit or otherwise
            alter his, her or its relationship with Employer.

      d.    Work Product. For purposes of this Section 4, "Work Product" shall
            mean all intellectual property rights, including all trade secrets,
            U.S. and international copyrights, patentable inventions,
            discoveries and other intellectual property rights in any
            programming, design, documentation, technology, or other work
            product that is created in connection with Executive's work. In
            addition, all rights in any preexisting programming, design,
            documentation, technology, or other

                                       5

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            Work Product provided to Employer during Executive's employment
            shall automatically become part of the Work Product hereunder,
            whether or not it arises specifically out of Executive's "Work." For
            purposes of this Agreement, "Work" shall mean (i) any direct
            assignments and required performance by or for Employer, and (ii)
            any other productive output that relates to the business of Employer
            and is produced during the course of Executive's employment or
            engagement by Employer. For this purpose, Work may be considered
            present even after normal working hours, away from Employer's
            premises, on an unsupervised basis, alone or with others. Unless
            otherwise approved in writing by the Board, this Agreement shall
            apply to all Work Product created in connection with all Work
            conducted before or after the date of this Agreement.

                  Employer shall own all rights in the Work Product. To this
            end, all Work Product shall be considered work made for hire for
            Employer. If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law or
            agreement, be considered Work made by Executive for hire for
            Employer (or if ownership of all rights therein do not otherwise
            vest exclusively in Employer immediately), Executive agrees to
            assign, and upon creation thereof does hereby automatically assign,
            without further consideration, the ownership thereof to Employer.
            Executive hereby irrevocably relinquishes for the benefit of
            Employer and its assigns any moral rights in the Work Product
            recognized by applicable law. Employer shall have the right to
            obtain and hold, in whatever name or capacity it selects,
            copyrights, registrations, and any other protection available in the
            Work Product.

                  Executive agrees to perform upon the request of Employer,
            during or after Executive's Work or employment, such further acts as
            may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend
            Employer's ownership of the Work Product, including by (i)
            executing, acknowledging, and delivering any requested affidavits
            and documents of assignment and conveyance, (ii) obtaining and/or
            aiding in the enforcement of copyrights, trade secrets, and (if
            applicable) patents with respect to the Work Product in any
            countries, and (iii) providing testimony in connection with any
            proceeding affecting the rights of Employer in any Work Product. In
            the event that Executive is required to perform the services
            described in this paragraph after his employment with the Employer
            has terminated, Executive will be reasonably compensated for actual
            time spent providing such services.

                  Executive warrants that his Work for Employer does not and
            will not in any way conflict with any obligations Executive may have
            with any prior employer or contractor. Executive also agrees to
            develop all Work Product in a manner that avoids even the appearance
            of infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights.

      e.    Survival of Covenants. Each covenant of Executive set forth in this
            Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
            Executive's employment for any reason and shall be construed as an
            agreement independent of any other

                                       6

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause
            of action of Executive against Employer whether predicated on this
            Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a defense to the
            enforcement by Employer of said covenant. No modification or waiver
            of any covenant contained in this Section 4 shall be valid unless
            such waiver or modification is approved in writing by the Board.

      f.    Remedies. In the event of a breach, violation or threatened breach
            or violation by Executive of any provision of this Section 4,
            Executive agrees that Employer shall be entitled to relief by
            temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent
            injunction or otherwise, in addition to other legal and equitable
            relief to which it may be entitled, including any and all monetary
            damages which Employer may incur as a result of said breach,
            violation or threatened breach or violation. Employer may pursue any
            remedy available to it concurrently or consecutively in any order as
            to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the
            pursuit of one of such remedies at any time will not be deemed an
            election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other of
            such remedies as to such breach, violation, or threatened breach or
            violation, or as to any other breach, violation, or threatened
            breach or violation.

                  Executive hereby acknowledges that Executive's agreement to be
            bound by the protective covenants set forth in this Section 4 was a
            material inducement for Employer entering into this Agreement,
            agreeing to pay Executive the compensation and benefits set forth
            herein, and providing Executive with Employer's Confidential
            Information and other proprietary information.

5.    Termination. The employment relationship between Executive and Employer
      created hereunder shall terminate before the expiration of the stated term
      of this Agreement upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:

      a.    Death or Permanent Disability. The employment relationship shall be
            terminated effective on the death or permanent disability of
            Executive. However, Executive shall be entitled to leaves of absence
            from Employer in accordance with the policy of Employer generally
            applicable to executives for illness or temporary disabilities for a
            period or periods not exceeding three (3) months in any calendar
            year, and his status as an Executive shall continue during such
            periods. However, if Executive qualifies for short-term disability
            payments under Employer's standard short-term disability plan during
            such leave, Executive shall apply to receive such short-term
            disability payments. Employer shall supplement such short term
            disability payments so that Executive receives such monthly amounts
            when combined with the short term disability payments to equal
            Executive's monthly compensation as set forth in Section 3(a) of
            this Agreement. If Executive is incapacitated due to physical or
            mental illness and such incapacity prevents Executive from
            satisfactorily performing his duties for Employer on a full time
            basis for six (6) months or more, Executive shall be deemed to have
            experienced a permanent disability and Employer may terminate this
            Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon the death or
            permanent disability of

            Executive, Executive or his estate (as the case may be) shall be

      b.    Termination for Cause. The following events, which for purposes of

                  Executive with respect to any aspect of Employer's business;

            ii.   The breach by Executive of any provision of Sections 1, 2 or 4
                  of this Agreement (including but not limited to a refusal to
                  follow lawful directives of the Board, the Chief Executive
                  Officer or their designees which are not inconsistent with the
                  duties of Executive's position and the provisions of this
                  Agreement);

            iii.  The conviction of Executive by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction of a felony or of a crime involving moral
                  turpitude;

            iv.   The intentional and material breach by Executive of any
                  non-disclosure or non-competition/non-solicitation provision
                  of any agreement to which Executive and Employer or any of its
                  subsidiaries are parties;

            v.    The intentional failure by Executive to perform in all
                  material respects his duties and responsibilities (other than
                  as a result of death or disability) and the failure of
                  Executive to cure the same in all material respects within
                  fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from the Chief
                  Executive Officer or his designee;

            vi.   The illegal use of drugs by Executive during the term of this
                  Agreement that, in the determination of the Board,
                  substantially interferes with Executive's performance of his
                  duties hereunder;

            vii.  Acceptance of employment with any other employer except upon
                  written permission of the Board; or

            viii. The breach by Executive of his fiduciary duty to Employer.

            Employer shall provide Executive with a written notice of
            termination, which can be provided on the date of termination. In
            the event Executive's employment is terminated for Cause hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b) and (c) below.

      c.    Termination by Employer with Notice. Employer may terminate this
            Agreement without Cause at any time upon thirty (30) days written
            notice to Executive, during which period Executive shall not be
            required to perform any services for Employer other than to assist
            Employer in training his successor and generally

            preparing for an orderly transition; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
            Executive shall be entitled to compensation upon such termination as
            provided in Section 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

      d.    Termination by Executive For Good Reason. Executive shall be
            entitled to terminate this Agreement at any time for Good Reason.
            For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
            occurrence of any of the following events:

            i.    Without his express written consent, the assignment of
                  Executive to a position functionally inferior to his position
                  with Employer on the date of this Agreement;

            ii.   The change of the location where Executive is based to a
                  location which is more than fifty (50) miles from his present
                  location without Executive's written consent; or

            iii.  A reduction by Employer in Executive's base salary as in
                  effect on the date hereof, unless such reduction is a
                  proportionate reduction of the compensation of Executive and
                  all other senior officers of Employer as a part of a
                  company-wide effort to enhance the financial condition of
                  Employer.

            Executive shall give Employer thirty (30) business days notice of an
            intent to terminate this Agreement for "Good Reason" as defined in
            this Section 5(d), and provide Employer with ten (10) business days
            after receipt of such notice from Executive to remedy the alleged
            violation of Subsections 5(d)(i), (ii) or (iii). In the event
            Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason hereunder,
            Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided in Sections
            6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

6.    Compensation Upon Termination. Upon the termination of Executive's
      employment under this Agreement before the expiration of the stated term
      hereof for any reason, Executive shall be entitled to:

      a.    the salary earned by him before the effective date of termination as
            provided in Section 3(a) hereof (including salary payable during any
            applicable notice period), prorated on the basis of the number of
            full days of service rendered by Executive during the salary payment
            period to the effective date of termination;

      b.    any accrued, but unpaid, vacation benefits; and

      c.    any previously authorized but unreimbursed business expenses.

      If Executive's employment hereunder terminates because of the death or
      permanent disability of Executive, Executive shall be entitled to the
      lesser of (i) the balance of

                                       9

      Executive's base salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any,
      remaining in the term of this Agreement or (ii) twelve (12) months' base
      salary. In addition, in the event of Executive's permanent disability,
      Executive shall receive continued medical insurance benefits, at
      Employer's expense, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of
      the termination of this Agreement. All amounts that may be due to
      Executive under this Section 6 or Section 5(a) shall be paid to him or his
      administrators, personal representatives, heirs and legatees, as may be
      appropriate.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or other
      plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the time of
      termination of his employment, Executive's rights and benefits under each
      such plan shall be determined in accordance with the terms, conditions,
      and limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
      Executive which may then be in effect.

      d.    Additional Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination Without Cause,
            With Notice or for Good Reason. If Executive's employment hereunder
            terminates without "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), with
            notice pursuant to Section 5(c) above, or for "Good Reason" (as
            defined in Section 5(d) above) Employer shall, upon Executive's
            execution of a general release of claims in favor of Employer,
            provide to Executive in addition to the amounts set forth in
            Subsections 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) above:

            i.    a cash payment equal to the greater of (y) Executive's base
                  salary (as set forth in Section 3(a) above), if any, remaining
                  in the term of Executive's Agreement or (z) twelve (12)
                  months' base salary;

            ii.   a cash payment equal to the average annual cash bonus paid to
                  Executive for the two (2) full bonus plan years immediately
                  preceding the date Executive's employment terminates; and

            iii.  continued medical insurance benefits, at Employer's expense,
                  for a period of twelve (12) months.

            Employer shall pay the severance amounts referenced in Section
            6(d)(i) in equal semi-monthly installments for a period of twelve
            (12) months ("Severance Period") in accordance with Employer's
            regular payroll practices. Executive shall have no obligation to
            mitigate any severance obligation of Employer under this Agreement
            by seeking new employment. Employer shall not be entitled to set off
            or reduce any severance payments owed to Executive under this
            Agreement by the amount of earnings or benefits received by
            Executive in future employment. The provisions of Sections 4, 5 and
            6 hereof shall survive the termination of the employment
            relationship hereunder and this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock options or
            other plans or programs in which Executive is participating at the
            time of termination of his employment, Executive's rights and
            benefits under each such plan shall be

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

            determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations
            of the plan and any separate agreement executed by Executive which
            may then be in effect.

      e.    If, during the Severance Period, Executive is in breach of his
            post-employment covenants contained in Section 4 of this Agreement,
            Employer shall not be obligated to pay any severance payments
            referenced herein, Employer's severance obligations shall terminate
            and expire, and Employer shall have no further obligations to
            Executive hereunder from and after the date of such breach and shall
            have all other rights and remedies available under this Agreement or
            any other agreement and at law or in equity.

7.    Compensation Upon Change in Control.

      a.    For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of Employer
            shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as:

            i.    any "person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
                  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
                  "Exchange Act")) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as
                  defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
                  indirectly, of voting securities of Employer representing more
                  than 50% of Employer's outstanding voting securities or rights
                  to acquire such securities except for any voting securities
                  issued or purchased under any employee benefit plan of
                  Employer or its subsidiaries; or

            ii.   individuals who constitute the Board on the date hereof (the
                  "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least
                  a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a
                  director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was
                  approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors
                  comprising the Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for
                  election by Employer's stockholders was approved by a
                  Nominating Committee solely composed of members which are
                  Incumbent Board members, shall be, for purposes of this clause
                  (ii), considered as though he were a member of the Incumbent
                  Board; or

            iii.  a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all
                  or substantially all of the assets of Employer or similar
                  transaction occurs or is effectuated in which Employer is not
                  the resulting entity; provided, however, that such an event
                  listed above will be deemed to have occurred or to have been
                  effectuated upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals
                  not including the lapse of any required waiting periods; or

            iv.   the Board determines in its sole discretion that a Change in
                  Control has occurred.

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      b.    Benefits Upon Change in Control.

            i.    Severance Benefits. If Executive's employment with Employer is
                  terminated (A) by Employer (or by the acquiring or successor
                  business entity following a Change of Control) other than for
                  "Cause" (as defined in Section 5(b) above), death or permanent
                  disability, or (B) by Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined
                  in Section 5(d) above) in either event within a period
                  beginning ninety (90) days before, and ending one (1) year
                  after, the date of a Change of Control (the "Change Period"),
                  Executive shall receive a cash severance benefit in an amount
                  equal to (a) for a termination occurring between the effective
                  date hereof and October 6, 2005, 267% of Executive's cash base
                  salary and bonus in effect for the most recent fiscal year
                  immediately preceding the Change of Control, and (b) for a
                  termination occurring after October 6, 2005, 250% of
                  Executive's average annual cash base salary and bonus in
                  effect for the two (2) years immediately preceding the Change
                  of Control.

                  In addition, for sixty (60) months (which shall, effective
                  October 6, 2005, be reduced to twenty four (24) months)
                  following the date of termination of Executive's employment in
                  circumstances in which a severance payment is due under this
                  Section 7(b), Employer shall provide Executive, at Employer's
                  expense, health and other welfare benefits that are not less
                  favorable to Executive than those to which he was entitled
                  immediately prior to the Change in Control. Provided however,
                  Employer shall have no obligation to provide Executive with
                  any severance compensation under this Section 7 if Executive
                  is in breach or violation of any of the covenants contained in
                  Section 4, which are applicable to Executive at the time of
                  the severance payment.

            ii.   Form of Payment. The amount of the severance benefit provided
                  in Section 7(c)(i) hereof shall be paid to Executive in a lump
                  sum within thirty (30) days of Executive's termination, unless
                  such payment must be delayed so as to avoid classification as
                  "deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

            iii.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7, in the
                  event that:

                  (aa)  the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or
                        afforded to Executive, which are deemed to be parachute
                        payments as defined in Code Section 280G or any
                        successor thereof, (the "Termination Benefits") would be
                        deemed to include an "excess parachute payment" under
                        Code Section 280G; and

                  (bb)  if such Termination Benefits were reduced to an amount
                        (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is one
                        dollar

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                        ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times
                        Executive's "base amount," as determined in accordance
                        with Code Section 280G and the Non-Triggering Amount
                        less the product of the marginal rate of any applicable
                        state and federal income tax and the Non-Triggering
                        Amount would be greater than the aggregate value of the
                        Termination Benefits (without such reduction) minus (a)
                        the amount of tax required to be paid by Executive
                        thereon by Code Section 4999 and further minus (b) the
                        product of the Termination Benefits and the marginal
                        rate of any applicable state and federal income tax,
                        then the Termination Benefits shall be reduced to the
                        Non-Triggering Amount. The allocation of the reduction
                        required hereby among the Termination Benefits shall be
                        determined by Executive.

            iv.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any stock
                  options or other plans or programs in which Executive is
                  participating at the time of termination of his employment,
                  Executive's rights and benefits under each such plan shall be
                  determined in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
                  limitations of the plan and any separate agreement executed by
                  Executive which may then be in effect.

      c.    No Mitigation or Offset. Executive shall not be required to mitigate
            the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 of this
            Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. Employer shall
            not be entitled to set off or reduce any severance payments owed to
            Executive under this Section 7 by the amount of earnings or benefits
            received by Executive in future employment.

8.    Term. This Agreement shall be binding and enforceable against Employer and
      Executive immediately upon its execution by both such parties. The stated
      term of this Agreement and the employment relationship created hereunder
      shall begin on December 20, 2004, and shall remain in effect for two (2)
      years thereafter, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 5
      hereof (the "Initial Employment Term"). This Agreement shall be
      automatically renewed for successive one (1) year terms after the Initial
      Employment Term ("Renewal Term"), unless terminated by either party at
      least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Employment Period
      or any Renewal Term.

      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
      parties' respective rights and obligations under Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7
      shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the
      termination of Executive's employment for any reason whatsoever.

9.    Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement will be entitled to
      enforce its rights under this Agreement, specifically, to recover damages
      by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise
      all other rights existing in its favor. Notwithstanding Section 10 below,
      the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an
      adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this

                                       13

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

      Agreement and that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court
      of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
      injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the
      provisions of this Agreement.

10.   Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
      Agreement or relating to Executive's rights, compensation and
      responsibilities as an Executive, excluding any claims based on violations
      of Section 4, shall be determined by arbitration in Dallas County, Texas
      in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then
      in effect. The arbitration shall be submitted to a single arbitrator
      selected in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's
      procedures then in effect for the selection of employment arbitrators. The
      parties shall split the cost of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
      the authority to award any remedy that could be awarded by a court of
      competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses and fees
      associated with such arbitration. This Section 10 shall survive
      termination of this Agreement for any reason.

11.   Non-Disparagement. Executive and Employer agree not to make any statements
      that disparage the reputation of (i) Employer, its products, services or
      employees, or (ii) Executive. Executive and Employer further acknowledge
      and agree that any breach or violation of this non-disparagement provision
      shall entitle Executive or Employer to seek injunctive relief to prevent
      any future breaches of this provision and/or to sue the other party on
      this Agreement for the immediate recovery of any damages caused by such
      breach. For purposes of this provision, Employer's obligation shall be
      limited to the Executive Committee of the Board and executives who are
      members of the Employer's Senior Policy Committee.

12.   Assignment. This Agreement is personal to Executive and may not be
      assigned in any way by Executive without the prior written consent of
      Employer. This Agreement shall not be assignable or delegable by Employer,
      other than to an affiliate of Employer; provided, however, that in the
      event of the acquisition, merger or consolidation of Employer, the
      obligations of Employer hereunder shall be binding upon the surviving or
      resulting entity of such acquisition, merger or consolidation. The rights
      and obligations under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
      shall be binding upon the heirs, legatees, administrators and personal
      representatives of Executive and upon the successors, representatives and
      assigns of Employer.

13.   Severability and Reformation. The parties hereto intend all provisions of
      this Agreement to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If,
      however, any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid,
      or unenforceable under present or future law, such provision shall be
      fully severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
      such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision were never a part
      hereof, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect
      and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
      provision or by its severance. In lieu of such illegal, invalid or
      unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of
      this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
      terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
      possible, and Employer and

<PAGE>

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.5

                           OFFICER INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

      This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of December 20,
2004 by and between Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and Joseph M. Grant ("Indemnitee").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve
publicly-held corporations as officers or in other capacities unless such
persons are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them
arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has
determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the
Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense,
liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries
from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a
customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and
other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market
conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only
at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, officers of
corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to
expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters
that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business
enterprise itself. The By-laws of the Company require indemnification of the
officers of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"). The
By-laws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set
forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be
entered into between the Company and officers of the Company with respect to
indemnification;

      WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to
indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such
persons;

      WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in
attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of
the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such
persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;

      WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf
of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they
will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they
will not be so indemnified;

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the
By-laws of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall
not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of
Indemnitee thereunder; and

<PAGE>

      WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the
Company's By-laws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and
may not be willing to serve and continue to serve as an officer without adequate
protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.
Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and take on additional service
for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants
contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

      Section 1. Services to the Company. Indemnitee agrees to serve and
continue to serve as a an officer of the Company and, at the request of the
Company, as an officer of Texas Capital Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"). Indemnitee may
at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other
contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which
event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue
Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment
contract between the Company and Indemnitee. The foregoing notwithstanding, this
Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as an
officer of the Company or the Bank.

      Section 2. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

            (a) A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest
to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events:

                  (i) Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial
      Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
      Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
      Company's then outstanding securities;

                  (ii) During any period of two consecutive years (not including
      any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at
      the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director
      (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an
      agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections
      2(a)(i), 2(a)(iii) or 2(a)(iv)) whose election by the Board or nomination
      for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were
      directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination
      for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to
      constitute a least a majority of the members of the Board;

                  (iii) The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the
      Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which
      would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
      immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent
      (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting
      securities of the surviving entity) more than 51% of the combined voting
      power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding
      immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect
      at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of
      such surviving entity;

                  (iv) The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
      complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
      disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
      assets; and

                  (v) There occurs any other event of a nature that would be
      required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
      Regulation 14A (or a response to any similar item on any similar schedule
      or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below), whether or
      not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.

For purposes of this Section 2(a), the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

                        (A) "Person" shall have the meaning as set forth in
            Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Person shall exclude (i) the Company, (ii) any trustee or other
            fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
            Company, and (iii) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by
            the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
            proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.

                        (B) "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning given to
            such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Beneficial Owner shall exclude any Person otherwise becoming a
            Beneficial Owner by reason of the stockholders of the Company
            approving a merger of the Company with another entity.

            (b) "Corporate Status" describes the status of a person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other
corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company.

            (c) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is
not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is
sought by Indemnitee.

            (d) "Enterprise" shall mean the Company and any other corporation,

as amended.

            (f) "Expenses" shall include all reasonable attorneys' fees,
retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel
expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges,
postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the

in settlement by Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against
Indemnitee.

            (g) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law
firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently
is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company
or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with
respect to matters concerning the Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other
indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other party
to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include
any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company
or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this
Agreement. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel
against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or

            (h) The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,
investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened
or completed proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Company or
otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
nature, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party or otherwise
by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was an officer of the Company, by
reason of any action taken by him or of any action on his part while acting as
an officer of the Company, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, committee member or official of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in
each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or
expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of

the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Company" as referred to in this Agreement.

      Section 3. Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings. The Company shall
indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if
Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any
Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure
a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in
connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if
Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and,

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

in the case of a criminal proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

      Section 4. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company. The
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a
participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a
judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter
therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No
indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally
adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent
that the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court in which the Proceeding was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnification.

      Section 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is
successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all
claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify
Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.
If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding, the Company also
shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with a claim, issue or matter related to any claim, issue, or matter
on which the Indemnitee was successful. For purposes of this Section 5 and
without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a
Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a
successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      Section 6. Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason
of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not
a parry, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.

      Section 7. Additional Indemnification.

            (a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 3, 4 or 5, the
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if
Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding
(including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment
in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
Proceeding.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

            (b) For purposes of Sections 7(a), the meaning of the phrase "to the
fullest extent permitted by law" shall include, but not be limited to:

                  (i) to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the
      DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by
      agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or
      replacement of the DGCL; and

                  (ii) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
      amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this
      Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify
      its officers.

      Section 8. Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in
connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

            (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of
Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with
respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other
indemnity provision; or

            (b) for any payment which is prohibited by any applicable law or
regulation promulgated by any federal or state legislation or banking regulatory
agency; or

            (c) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or
sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state statutory
law or common law; or

            (d) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of
any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors,
officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the
Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the
Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in the Company under applicable law.

      Section 9. Advances of Expenses. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance the expenses incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within 30 days after the receipt by
the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to
time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances
shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to
Indemnitee's ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's
ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this
Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred
pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses
incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the
advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution
and delivery to the Company of this Agreement which shall constitute an
undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advance to the
extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company. This Section 9 shall not apply to any claim made by
Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 8.

      Section 10. Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim.

            (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall
submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is
reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification, not later than 30 days after receipt by Indemnitee
of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding. The omission to notify the
Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to
Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company
shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the
Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

            (b) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at
its own expense.

      Section 11. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.

            (a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 10(a), a determination, if required by
applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made
in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be
delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred,
(A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a
quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by
a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum
of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such
Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion
to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so
directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; and, if it is so
determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee
shall be made within 10 days after such determination. Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with
respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to
such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation
or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure
and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such
determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons
or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective
of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the
Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

            (b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification
is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the
Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11(b). If a
Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee
advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change
in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by
Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the
Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall
give written notice to the Company advising it of the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or
the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice
of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as
the case maybe, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that
such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel
so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined
in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with
particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely
objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such
written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so
selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is
withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If,
within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall
have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which
shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of
Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a
person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall
designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or
the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a)
hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be
discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject
to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

      Section 12. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

            (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to
indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such
determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in
accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the
burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by
any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent
legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any
action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor
an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or
independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

            (b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under
Section 11 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt
by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of
entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee
shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a
reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person, persons or

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of
documentation and/or information relating thereto; provided, further, that the
foregoing provisions of this Section 12(b) shall not apply (i) if the
determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the
stockholders pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement and if (A) within 15
days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the
Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their
consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within 75 days after such
receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of
stockholders is called within 15 days after such receipt for the purpose of
making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within 60 days
after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if
the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent
Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement.

            (c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or
matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee
to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding,
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

            (d) Reliance as Safe Harbor. For purposes of any determination of
good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if
Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the
Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to
Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or
on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records
given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public
accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care
by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not be deemed to
be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the
Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in this Agreement.

            (e) Actions of Others. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to
act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be
imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification
under this Agreement.

      Section 13. Remedies of Indemnity.

            (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to
Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant
to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to
indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement
within 45 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification,
(iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the
last sentence of Section 11(a) of this Agreement within 10 days after receipt by
the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification
pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Agreement is not made within 10 days after a determination has been made that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an
adjudication by a court of his entitlement to such indemnification or
advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an
award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee
shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in
arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the
right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a); provided,
however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding
brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement.
The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or
award in arbitration.

            (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant
to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to
this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or
arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of
that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced
pursuant to this Section 13 the Company shall have the burden of proving
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the
case may be.

            (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section
11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the
Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or
arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law.

            (d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the
procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator
that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. The Company
shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by
Indemnitee, shall (within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written
request therefore) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for
indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or
under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by
the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be
entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery,
as the case may be.

      Section 14. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.

            (a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable
law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's By-laws, any
agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof
shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect
of

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to
such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware
law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or
advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's
By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by
such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment
of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

            (b) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or
policies providing liability insurance for officers of the Company or of any
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company,
Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or
their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such
director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the
time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such
insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of
such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

            (c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all
action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as
are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

            (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any
payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is provided
hereunder) hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or
otherwise.

            (e) The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses
hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced
by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement
of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      Section 15. Duration of Agreement. This Agreement shall continue until and
terminate upon the later of (a) 10 years after the date that Indemnitee shall
have ceased to serve as an officer or (b) one year after the final termination
of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights
of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding
commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

relating thereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his
heirs, executors and administrators.

      Section 16. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be
deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give
the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest
extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to
the intent manifested thereby.

      Section 17. Enforcement.

            (a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered
into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to
induce Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as an officer of the Company,
and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
serving as an officer of the Company.

            (b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied,
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, including,
without limitation, any prior indemnity agreements, all of which prior
agreements and understandings shall be void and of no further force and effect
as of the date hereof.

      Section 18. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
parties thereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement
nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

      Section 19. Notice by Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees promptly to notify the
Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena,
complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding
or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses
covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not
relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under
this Agreement or otherwise.

      Section 20. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given (a) if delivered by hand and receipted for by the parry to
whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed, or (b) mailed
by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day
after the date on which it is so mailed:

                  Attention: Chief Executive Officer

or to any other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee by the Company.

      Section 21. Contribution. To the fullest extent permissible under
applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is
unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of
indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee,
whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to
an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed
fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in
order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and
Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to
such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its
directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with
such event(s) and/or transaction(s).

      Section 22. Applicable Law and Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and
the legal relations among the parties shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to its conflict of laws rules. Except with respect to any arbitration commenced
by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Agreement, the Company and
Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agree that any action or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought
only in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Court"), and
not in any other state or federal court in the United States of America or any
court in any other country, (ii) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Delaware Court for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, (iii) waive any objection to the laying of
venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court, and (iv) waive,
and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding
brought in the Delaware Court has been brought in an improper or inconvenient
forum.

      Section 23. Identical Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is
sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement.

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.6

                           OFFICER INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

      This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of December 20,
2004 by and between Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and George F. Jones, Jr. ("Indemnitee").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve
publicly-held corporations as officers or in other capacities unless such
persons are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them
arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has
determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the
Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense,
liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries
from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a
customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and
other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market
conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only
at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, officers of
corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to
expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters
that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business
enterprise itself. The By-laws of the Company require indemnification of the
officers of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"). The
By-laws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set
forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be
entered into between the Company and officers of the Company with respect to
indemnification;

      WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to
indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such
persons;

      WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in
attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of
the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such
persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;

      WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf
of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they
will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they
will not be so indemnified;

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the
By-laws of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall
not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of
Indemnitee thereunder; and

<PAGE>

      WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the
Company's By-laws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and
may not be willing to serve and continue to serve as an officer without adequate
protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.
Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and take on additional service
for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants
contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

      Section 1. Services to the Company. Indemnitee agrees to serve and
continue to serve as a an officer of the Company and, at the request of the
Company, as an officer of Texas Capital Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"). Indemnitee may
at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other
contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which
event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue
Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment
contract between the Company and Indemnitee. The foregoing notwithstanding, this
Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as an
officer of the Company or the Bank.

      Section 2. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

            (a) A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest
to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events:

                  (i) Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial
      Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
      Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
      Company's then outstanding securities;

                  (ii) During any period of two consecutive years (not including
      any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at
      the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director
      (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an
      agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections
      2(a)(i), 2(a)(iii) or 2(a)(iv)) whose election by the Board or nomination
      for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were
      directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination
      for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to
      constitute a least a majority of the members of the Board;

                  (iii) The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the
      Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which
      would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
      immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent
      (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting
      securities of the surviving entity) more than 51% of the combined voting
      power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding
      immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect
      at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of
      such surviving entity;

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  (iv) The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
      complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
      disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
      assets; and

                  (v) There occurs any other event of a nature that would be
      required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
      Regulation 14A (or a response to any similar item on any similar schedule
      or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below), whether or
      not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.

For purposes of this Section 2(a), the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

                        (A) "Person" shall have the meaning as set forth in
            Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Person shall exclude (i) the Company, (ii) any trustee or other
            fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
            Company, and (iii) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by
            the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
            proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.

                        (B) "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning given to
            such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Beneficial Owner shall exclude any Person otherwise becoming a
            Beneficial Owner by reason of the stockholders of the Company
            approving a merger of the Company with another entity.

            (b) "Corporate Status" describes the status of a person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other
corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company.

            (c) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is
not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is
sought by Indemnitee.

            (d) "Enterprise" shall mean the Company and any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of
which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.

            (e) "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended.

            (f) "Expenses" shall include all reasonable attorneys' fees,
retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel
expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges,
postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the
types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing
to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in, or
otherwise participating in, a Proceeding. Expenses also shall include Expenses
incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding, including
without limitation the premium, security for, and other costs relating to any
cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

appeal bond or its equivalent. Expenses, however, shall not include amounts paid
in settlement by Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against
Indemnitee.

            (g) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law
firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently
is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company
or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with
respect to matters concerning the Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other
indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other party
to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include
any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company
or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this
Agreement. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel
against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.

            (h) The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,
investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened
or completed proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Company or
otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
nature, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party or otherwise
by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was an officer of the Company, by
reason of any action taken by him or of any action on his part while acting as
an officer of the Company, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, committee member or official of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in
each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or
expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of
expenses can be provided under this Agreement; except one initiated by a
Indemnitee to enforce his rights under this Agreement.

            (i) Reference to "other enterprise" shall include employee benefit
plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax assessed with respect
to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the
Company" shall include any service as an officer, director, committee member or
official which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such officer, with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Company" as referred to in this Agreement.

      Section 3. Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings. The Company shall
indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if
Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any
Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure
a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in
connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if
Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and,

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

in the case of a criminal proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

      Section 4. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company. The
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a
participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a
judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter
therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No
indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally
adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent
that the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court in which the Proceeding was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnification.

      Section 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is
successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all
claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify
Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.
If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding, the Company also
shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with a claim, issue or matter related to any claim, issue, or matter
on which the Indemnitee was successful. For purposes of this Section 5 and
without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a
Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a
successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      Section 6. Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason
of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not
a parry, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.

      Section 7. Additional Indemnification.

            (a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 3, 4 or 5, the
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if
Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding
(including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment
in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
Proceeding.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

            (b) For purposes of Sections 7(a), the meaning of the phrase "to the
fullest extent permitted by law" shall include, but not be limited to:

                  (i) to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the
      DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by
      agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or
      replacement of the DGCL; and

                  (ii) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
      amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this
      Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify
      its officers.

      Section 8. Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in
connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

            (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of
Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with
respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other
indemnity provision; or

            (b) for any payment which is prohibited by any applicable law or
regulation promulgated by any federal or state legislation or banking regulatory
agency; or

            (c) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or
sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state statutory
law or common law; or

            (d) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of
any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors,
officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the
Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the
Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in the Company under applicable law.

      Section 9. Advances of Expenses. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance the expenses incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within 30 days after the receipt by
the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to
time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances
shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to
Indemnitee's ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's
ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this
Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred
pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses
incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the
advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution
and delivery to the Company of this Agreement which shall constitute an
undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advance to the
extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company. This Section 9 shall not apply to any claim made by
Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 8.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

      Section 10. Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim.

            (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall
submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is
reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification, not later than 30 days after receipt by Indemnitee
of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding. The omission to notify the
Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to
Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company
shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the
Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

            (b) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at
its own expense.

      Section 11. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.

            (a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 10(a), a determination, if required by
applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made
in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be
delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred,
(A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a
quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by
a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum
of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such
Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion
to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so
directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; and, if it is so
determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee
shall be made within 10 days after such determination. Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with
respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to
such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation
or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure
and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such
determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons
or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective
of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the
Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

            (b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification
is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the
Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11(b). If a
Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee
advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change
in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by
Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the
Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall
give written notice to the Company advising it of the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or
the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice
of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as
the case maybe, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that
such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel
so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined
in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with
particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely
objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such
written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so
selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is
withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If,
within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall
have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which
shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of
Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a
person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall
designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or
the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a)
hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be
discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject
to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

      Section 12. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

            (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to
indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such
determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in
accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the
burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by
any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent
legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any
action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor
an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or
independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

            (b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under
Section 11 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt
by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of
entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee
shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a
reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person, persons or

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of
documentation and/or information relating thereto; provided, further, that the
foregoing provisions of this Section 12(b) shall not apply (i) if the
determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the
stockholders pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement and if (A) within 15
days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the
Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their
consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within 75 days after such
receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of
stockholders is called within 15 days after such receipt for the purpose of
making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within 60 days
after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if
the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent
Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement.

            (c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or
matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee
to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding,
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

            (d) Reliance as Safe Harbor. For purposes of any determination of
good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if
Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the
Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to
Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or
on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records
given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public
accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care
by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not be deemed to
be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the
Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in this Agreement.

            (e) Actions of Others. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to
act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be
imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification
under this Agreement.

      Section 13. Remedies of Indemnity.

            (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to
Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant
to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to
indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement
within 45 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification,
(iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the
last sentence of Section 11(a) of this Agreement within 10 days after receipt by
the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification
pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Agreement is not made within 10 days after a determination has been made that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an
adjudication by a court of his entitlement to such indemnification or
advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an
award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee
shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in
arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the
right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a); provided,
however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding
brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement.
The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or
award in arbitration.

            (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant
to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to
this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or
arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of
that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced
pursuant to this Section 13 the Company shall have the burden of proving
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the
case may be.

            (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section
11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the
Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or
arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law.

            (d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the
procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator
that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. The Company
shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by
Indemnitee, shall (within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written
request therefore) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for
indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or
under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by
the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be
entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery,
as the case may be.

      Section 14. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.

            (a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable
law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's By-laws, any
agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof
shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect
of

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to
such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware
law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or
advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's
By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by
such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment
of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

            (b) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or
policies providing liability insurance for officers of the Company or of any
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company,
Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or
their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such
director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the
time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such
insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of
such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

            (c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all
action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as
are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

            (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any
payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is provided
hereunder) hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or
otherwise.

            (e) The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses
hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced
by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement
of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      Section 15. Duration of Agreement. This Agreement shall continue until and
terminate upon the later of (a) 10 years after the date that Indemnitee shall
have ceased to serve as an officer or (b) one year after the final termination
of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights
of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding
commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

relating thereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his
heirs, executors and administrators.

      Section 16. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be
deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give
the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest
extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to
the intent manifested thereby.

      Section 17. Enforcement.

            (a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered
into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to
induce Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as an officer of the Company,
and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
serving as an officer of the Company.

            (b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied,
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, including,
without limitation, any prior indemnity agreements, all of which prior
agreements and understandings shall be void and of no further force and effect
as of the date hereof.

      Section 18. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
parties thereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement
nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

      Section 19. Notice by Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees promptly to notify the
Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena,
complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding
or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses
covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not
relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under
this Agreement or otherwise.

      Section 20. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given (a) if delivered by hand and receipted for by the parry to
whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed, or (b) mailed
by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day
after the date on which it is so mailed:

      Section 21. Contribution. To the fullest extent permissible under

whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to

<PAGE>

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.7

                           OFFICER INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

      This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of December 20,
2004 by and between Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and C. Keith Cargill ("Indemnitee").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve
publicly-held corporations as officers or in other capacities unless such
persons are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them
arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has
determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the
Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense,
liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries
from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a
customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and
other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market
conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only
at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, officers of
corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to
expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters
that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business
enterprise itself. The By-laws of the Company require indemnification of the
officers of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"). The
By-laws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set
forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be
entered into between the Company and officers of the Company with respect to
indemnification;

      WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to
indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such
persons;

      WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in
attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of
the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such
persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;

      WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf
of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they
will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they
will not be so indemnified;

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the
By-laws of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall
not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of
Indemnitee thereunder; and

<PAGE>

      WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the
Company's By-laws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and
may not be willing to serve and continue to serve as an officer without adequate
protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.
Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and take on additional service
for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants
contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

      Section 1. Services to the Company. Indemnitee agrees to serve and
continue to serve as a an officer of the Company and, at the request of the
Company, as an officer of Texas Capital Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"). Indemnitee may
at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other
contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which
event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue
Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment
contract between the Company and Indemnitee. The foregoing notwithstanding, this
Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as an
officer of the Company or the Bank.

      Section 2. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

            (a) A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest
to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events:

                  (i) Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial
      Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
      Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
      Company's then outstanding securities;

                  (ii) During any period of two consecutive years (not including
      any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at
      the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director
      (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an
      agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections
      2(a)(i), 2(a)(iii) or 2(a)(iv)) whose election by the Board or nomination
      for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were
      directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination
      for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to
      constitute a least a majority of the members of the Board;

                  (iii) The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the
      Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which
      would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
      immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent
      (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting
      securities of the surviving entity) more than 51% of the combined voting
      power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding
      immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect
      at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of
      such surviving entity;

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  (iv) The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
      complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
      disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
      assets; and

                  (v) There occurs any other event of a nature that would be
      required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
      Regulation 14A (or a response to any similar item on any similar schedule
      or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below), whether or
      not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.

For purposes of this Section 2(a), the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

                        (A) "Person" shall have the meaning as set forth in
            Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Person shall exclude (i) the Company, (ii) any trustee or other
            fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
            Company, and (iii) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by
            the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
            proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.

                        (B) "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning given to
            such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Beneficial Owner shall exclude any Person otherwise becoming a
            Beneficial Owner by reason of the stockholders of the Company
            approving a merger of the Company with another entity.

            (b) "Corporate Status" describes the status of a person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other
corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company.

            (c) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is
not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is
sought by Indemnitee.

            (d) "Enterprise" shall mean the Company and any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of
which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.

            (e) "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended.

            (f) "Expenses" shall include all reasonable attorneys' fees,
retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel
expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges,
postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the
types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing

otherwise participating in, a Proceeding. Expenses also shall include Expenses
incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding, including
without limitation the premium, security for, and other costs relating to any
cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

appeal bond or its equivalent. Expenses, however, shall not include amounts paid
in settlement by Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against
Indemnitee.

            (g) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law
firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently
is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company
or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with
respect to matters concerning the Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other
indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other party
to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include
any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company
or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this
Agreement. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel
against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.

            (h) The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,
investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened
or completed proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Company or
otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
nature, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party or otherwise
by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was an officer of the Company, by
reason of any action taken by him or of any action on his part while acting as
an officer of the Company, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, committee member or official of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in
each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or
expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of
expenses can be provided under this Agreement; except one initiated by a
Indemnitee to enforce his rights under this Agreement.

            (i) Reference to "other enterprise" shall include employee benefit
plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax assessed with respect
to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the
Company" shall include any service as an officer, director, committee member or
official which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such officer, with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Company" as referred to in this Agreement.

      Section 3. Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings. The Company shall
indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if
Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any
Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure
a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in
connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if
Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and,

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

in the case of a criminal proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

      Section 4. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company. The
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a
participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a
judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter
therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No
indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally
adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent
that the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court in which the Proceeding was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnification.

      Section 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is
successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all
claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify
Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.
If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding, the Company also
shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with a claim, issue or matter related to any claim, issue, or matter
on which the Indemnitee was successful. For purposes of this Section 5 and
without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a
Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a
successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      Section 6. Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason
of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not
a parry, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.

      Section 7. Additional Indemnification.

            (a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 3, 4 or 5, the
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if
Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding
(including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment
in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
Proceeding.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

            (b) For purposes of Sections 7(a), the meaning of the phrase "to the
fullest extent permitted by law" shall include, but not be limited to:

                  (i) to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the
      DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by
      agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or
      replacement of the DGCL; and

                  (ii) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
      amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this
      Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify
      its officers.

      Section 8. Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in
connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

            (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of
Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with
respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other
indemnity provision; or

            (b) for any payment which is prohibited by any applicable law or
regulation promulgated by any federal or state legislation or banking regulatory
agency; or

            (c) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or
sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state statutory
law or common law; or

            (d) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of
any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors,
officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the
Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the
Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in the Company under applicable law.

      Section 9. Advances of Expenses. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance the expenses incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within 30 days after the receipt by
the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to
time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances
shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to
Indemnitee's ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's
ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this
Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred
pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses
incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the
advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution
and delivery to the Company of this Agreement which shall constitute an
undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advance to the
extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company. This Section 9 shall not apply to any claim made by
Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 8.

      Section 10. Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim.

            (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall
submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is
reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification, not later than 30 days after receipt by Indemnitee
of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding. The omission to notify the
Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to
Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company
shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the
Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

            (b) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at
its own expense.

      Section 11. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.

            (a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 10(a), a determination, if required by
applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made
in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be
delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred,
(A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a
quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by
a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum
of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such
Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion
to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so
directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; and, if it is so
determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee
shall be made within 10 days after such determination. Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with
respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to
such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation
or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure
and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such
determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons
or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective
of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the
Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

            (b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification
is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the
Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11(b). If a
Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee
advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change
in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by
Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the
Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall
give written notice to the Company advising it of the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or
the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice
of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as
the case maybe, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that
such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel
so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined
in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with
particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely
objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such
written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so
selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is
withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If,
within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall
have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which
shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of
Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a
person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall
designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or
the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a)
hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be
discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject
to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

      Section 12. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

            (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to
indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such
determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in
accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the
burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by
any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent
legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any
action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor
an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or
independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

            (b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under
Section 11 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt
by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of
entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee
shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a
reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person, persons or

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of
documentation and/or information relating thereto; provided, further, that the
foregoing provisions of this Section 12(b) shall not apply (i) if the
determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the
stockholders pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement and if (A) within 15
days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the
Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their
consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within 75 days after such
receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of
stockholders is called within 15 days after such receipt for the purpose of
making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within 60 days
after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if
the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent
Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement.

            (c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or
matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee
to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding,
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

            (d) Reliance as Safe Harbor. For purposes of any determination of
good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if
Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the
Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to
Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or
on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records
given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public
accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care
by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not be deemed to
be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the
Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in this Agreement.

            (e) Actions of Others. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to
act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be
imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification
under this Agreement.

      Section 13. Remedies of Indemnity.

            (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to
Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant
to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to
indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement
within 45 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification,
(iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the
last sentence of Section 11(a) of this Agreement within 10 days after receipt by
the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification
pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Agreement is not made within 10 days after a determination has been made that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an
adjudication by a court of his entitlement to such indemnification or
advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an
award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee
shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in
arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the
right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a); provided,
however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding
brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement.
The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or
award in arbitration.

            (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant
to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to
this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or
arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of
that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced
pursuant to this Section 13 the Company shall have the burden of proving
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the
case may be.

            (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section
11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the
Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or
arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law.

            (d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the
procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator
that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. The Company
shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by
Indemnitee, shall (within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written
request therefore) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for
indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or
under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by
the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be
entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery,
as the case may be.

      Section 14. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.

            (a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable
law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's By-laws, any
agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof
shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect
of

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to
such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware
law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or
advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's
By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by
such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment
of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

            (b) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or
policies providing liability insurance for officers of the Company or of any
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company,
Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or
their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such
director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the
time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such
insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of
such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

            (c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all
action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as
are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

            (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any
payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is provided
hereunder) hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or
otherwise.

            (e) The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses
hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced
by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement
of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      Section 15. Duration of Agreement. This Agreement shall continue until and
terminate upon the later of (a) 10 years after the date that Indemnitee shall
have ceased to serve as an officer or (b) one year after the final termination
of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights
of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding
commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

relating thereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his
heirs, executors and administrators.

      Section 16. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be
deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give
the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest
extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to
the intent manifested thereby.

      Section 17. Enforcement.

            (a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered
into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to
induce Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as an officer of the Company,
and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
serving as an officer of the Company.

            (b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied,
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, including,
without limitation, any prior indemnity agreements, all of which prior
agreements and understandings shall be void and of no further force and effect
as of the date hereof.

      Section 18. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
parties thereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement
nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

      Section 19. Notice by Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees promptly to notify the
Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena,
complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding
or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses
covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not
relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under
this Agreement or otherwise.

      Section 20. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given (a) if delivered by hand and receipted for by the parry to
whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed, or (b) mailed
by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day
after the date on which it is so mailed:

            (a) If to Indemnitee, at the address indicated on the signature page
of this Agreement, or such other address as Indemnitee shall provide to the
Company.

            (b) If to the Company to:

                  Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.
                  2100 McKinney Avenue, Suite 900

                  Attention: Chief Executive Officer

or to any other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee by the Company.

      Section 21. Contribution. To the fullest extent permissible under
applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is
unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of
indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee,
whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to
an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed
fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in
order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and
Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to
such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its
directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with
such event(s) and/or transaction(s).

<DESCRIPTION>OFFICER INDEMNITY AGREEMENT - PETER B. BARTHOLOW
<TEXT>
<PAGE>

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.8

                           OFFICER INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

      This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of December 20,
2004 by and between Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and Peter B. Bartholow ("Indemnitee").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve
publicly-held corporations as officers or in other capacities unless such
persons are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them
arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has
determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the
Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense,
liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries
from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a
customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and
other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market
conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only
at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, officers of
corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to
expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters
that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business
enterprise itself. The By-laws of the Company require indemnification of the
officers of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"). The
By-laws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set
forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be
entered into between the Company and officers of the Company with respect to
indemnification;

      WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to
indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such
persons;

      WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in
attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of
the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such
persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;

      WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf
of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they
will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they
will not be so indemnified;

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the
By-laws of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall
not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of
Indemnitee thereunder; and

<PAGE>

      WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the
Company's By-laws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and
may not be willing to serve and continue to serve as an officer without adequate
protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.
Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and take on additional service
for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants
contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

      Section 1. Services to the Company. Indemnitee agrees to serve and
continue to serve as a an officer of the Company and, at the request of the
Company, as an officer of Texas Capital Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"). Indemnitee may
at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other
contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which
event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue
Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment
contract between the Company and Indemnitee. The foregoing notwithstanding, this
Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as an
officer of the Company or the Bank.

      Section 2. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

            (a) A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest
to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events:

                  (i) Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial
      Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
      Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
      Company's then outstanding securities;

                  (ii) During any period of two consecutive years (not including
      any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at
      the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director
      (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an
      agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections
      2(a)(i), 2(a)(iii) or 2(a)(iv)) whose election by the Board or nomination
      for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were
      directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination
      for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to
      constitute a least a majority of the members of the Board;

                  (iii) The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the
      Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which
      would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
      immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent
      (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting
      securities of the surviving entity) more than 51% of the combined voting
      power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding
      immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect
      at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of
      such surviving entity;

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  (iv) The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
      complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
      disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
      assets; and

                  (v) There occurs any other event of a nature that would be
      required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
      Regulation 14A (or a response to any similar item on any similar schedule
      or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below), whether or
      not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.

For purposes of this Section 2(a), the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

                        (A) "Person" shall have the meaning as set forth in
            Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Person shall exclude (i) the Company, (ii) any trustee or other
            fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
            Company, and (iii) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by
            the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
            proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.

                        (B) "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning given to
            such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
            that Beneficial Owner shall exclude any Person otherwise becoming a
            Beneficial Owner by reason of the stockholders of the Company
            approving a merger of the Company with another entity.

            (b) "Corporate Status" describes the status of a person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other
corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company.

            (c) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Company who is
not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is
sought by Indemnitee.

            (d) "Enterprise" shall mean the Company and any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of
which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.

            (e) "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended.

            (f) "Expenses" shall include all reasonable attorneys' fees,
retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel
expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges,
postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the
types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing
to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in, or
otherwise participating in, a Proceeding. Expenses also shall include Expenses
incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding, including
without limitation the premium, security for, and other costs relating to any
cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

appeal bond or its equivalent. Expenses, however, shall not include amounts paid
in settlement by Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against
Indemnitee.

            (g) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a law
firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently
is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company
or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with
respect to matters concerning the Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other
indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other party
to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include
any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company
or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this
Agreement. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel
against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.

            (h) The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,
investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened
or completed proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Company or
otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
nature, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party or otherwise
by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was an officer of the Company, by
reason of any action taken by him or of any action on his part while acting as
an officer of the Company, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, committee member or official of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in
each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or
expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of
expenses can be provided under this Agreement; except one initiated by a
Indemnitee to enforce his rights under this Agreement.

            (i) Reference to "other enterprise" shall include employee benefit
plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax assessed with respect
to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the
Company" shall include any service as an officer, director, committee member or
official which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such officer, with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Company" as referred to in this Agreement.

      Section 3. Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings. The Company shall
indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if
Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any
Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure
a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in
connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if
Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and,

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

in the case of a criminal proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

      Section 4. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company. The
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a
participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a
judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter
therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No
indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally
adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent
that the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court in which the Proceeding was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnification.

      Section 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is
successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all
claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify
Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.
If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding, the Company also
shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with a claim, issue or matter related to any claim, issue, or matter
on which the Indemnitee was successful. For purposes of this Section 5 and
without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a
Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a
successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      Section 6. Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason
of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not
a parry, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.

      Section 7. Additional Indemnification.

            (a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 3, 4 or 5, the
Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if
Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding
(including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment
in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the
Proceeding.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

            (b) For purposes of Sections 7(a), the meaning of the phrase "to the
fullest extent permitted by law" shall include, but not be limited to:

                  (i) to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the
      DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by
      agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or
      replacement of the DGCL; and

                  (ii) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
      amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this
      Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify
      its officers.

      Section 8. Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in
connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

            (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of
Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with
respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other
indemnity provision; or

            (b) for any payment which is prohibited by any applicable law or
regulation promulgated by any federal or state legislation or banking regulatory
agency; or

            (c) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or
sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state statutory
law or common law; or

            (d) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of
any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors,
officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the
Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the
Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in the Company under applicable law.

      Section 9. Advances of Expenses. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance the expenses incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within 30 days after the receipt by
the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to
time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances
shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to
Indemnitee's ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's
ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this
Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred
pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses
incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the
advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution
and delivery to the Company of this Agreement which shall constitute an
undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advance to the
extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company. This Section 9 shall not apply to any claim made by
Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 8.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

      Section 10. Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim.

            (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall
submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is
reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification, not later than 30 days after receipt by Indemnitee
of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding. The omission to notify the
Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to
Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company
shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the
Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

            (b) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at
its own expense.

      Section 11. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.

            (a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 10(a), a determination, if required by
applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made
in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be
delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred,
(A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a
quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by
a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum
of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such
Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion
to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so
directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; and, if it is so
determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee
shall be made within 10 days after such determination. Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with
respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to
such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation
or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure
and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such
determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons
or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective
of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the
Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

            (b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification
is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the
Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11(b). If a
Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee
advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change
in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by
Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the
Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall
give written notice to the Company advising it of the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or
the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice
of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as
the case maybe, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that
such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel
so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined
in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with
particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely
objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such
written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so
selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is
withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If,
within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall
have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which
shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of
Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a
person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall
designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or
the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a)
hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be
discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject
to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

      Section 12. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

            (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to
indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such
determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in
accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the
burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by
any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent
legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any
action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor
an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or
independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

            (b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under
Section 11 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt
by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of
entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee
shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a
reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person, persons or

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of
documentation and/or information relating thereto; provided, further, that the
foregoing provisions of this Section 12(b) shall not apply (i) if the
determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the
stockholders pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement and if (A) within 15
days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the
Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their
consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within 75 days after such
receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of
stockholders is called within 15 days after such receipt for the purpose of
making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within 60 days
after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if
the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent
Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement.

            (c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or
matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee
to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding,
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

            (d) Reliance as Safe Harbor. For purposes of any determination of
good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if
Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the
Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to
Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or
on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records
given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public
accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care
by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not be deemed to
be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the
Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in this Agreement.

            (e) Actions of Others. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to
act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be
imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification
under this Agreement.

      Section 13. Remedies of Indemnity.

            (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to
Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant
to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to
indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement
within 45 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification,
(iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the
last sentence of Section 11(a) of this Agreement within 10 days after receipt by
the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification
pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Agreement is not made within 10 days after a determination has been made that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an
adjudication by a court of his entitlement to such indemnification or
advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an
award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee
shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in
arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the
right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a); provided,
however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding
brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement.
The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or
award in arbitration.

            (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant
to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to
this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or
arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of
that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced
pursuant to this Section 13 the Company shall have the burden of proving
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the
case may be.

            (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section
11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the
Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or
arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under
applicable law.

            (d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the
procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator
that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. The Company
shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by
Indemnitee, shall (within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written
request therefore) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for
indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or
under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by
the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be
entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery,
as the case may be.

      Section 14. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.

            (a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable
law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's By-laws, any
agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof
shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect
of

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to
such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware
law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or
advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's
By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by
such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment
of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

            (b) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or
policies providing liability insurance for officers of the Company or of any
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company,
Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or
their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such
director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the
time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such
insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of
such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

            (c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all
action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as
are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

            (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any
payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is provided
hereunder) hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or
otherwise.

            (e) The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses
hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced
by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement
of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      Section 15. Duration of Agreement. This Agreement shall continue until and
terminate upon the later of (a) 10 years after the date that Indemnitee shall
have ceased to serve as an officer or (b) one year after the final termination
of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights
of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding
commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

relating thereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his
heirs, executors and administrators.

      Section 16. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be
deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give
the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest
extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to
the intent manifested thereby.

      Section 17. Enforcement.

            (a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered
into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to
induce Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as an officer of the Company,
and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
serving as an officer of the Company.

            (b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied,
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, including,
without limitation, any prior indemnity agreements, all of which prior
agreements and understandings shall be void and of no further force and effect
as of the date hereof.

      Section 18. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
parties thereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement
nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

      Section 19. Notice by Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees promptly to notify the
Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena,
complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding
or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses
covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not
relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under
this Agreement or otherwise.

      Section 20. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given (a) if delivered by hand and receipted for by the parry to
whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed, or (b) mailed
by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day
after the date on which it is so mailed:

      Section 21. Contribution. To the fullest extent permissible under
applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is
unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of
indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee,
whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to
an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed
fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in
order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and
Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to
such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its
directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with
such event(s) and/or transaction(s).

      Section 22. Applicable Law and Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and
the legal relations among the parties shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to its conflict of laws rules. Except with respect to any arbitration commenced
by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Agreement, the Company and
Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agree that any action or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought
only in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Court"), and

or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement.

      Section 24. Miscellaneous. Use of the masculine pronoun shall be deemed to
include usage of the feminine pronoun where appropriate. The headings of the
paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be
