ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 20, 2004, CorVu Corporation (the "Company") and ComVest
Investment Partners II LLC ("ComVest") signed a term sheet for a financing
transaction. The term sheet provides that upon payment of $5,000,000, ComVest
will receive 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and immediately
exercisable warrants to purchase 6,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock
at $0.50 per share. At the closing of the financing, ComVest will also receive
warrants to purchase another 2,000,000 shares at $0.50; however, these warrants
will become exercisable only if less than two ComVest designees are members of
the Company's board of directors while ComVest owns more than 5,000,000 shares
of the Company's common stock. All warrants will be subject to anti-dilution
protection. The Company will have to pay a cash fee of $200,000 to ComVest at
the closing of the financing. The closing of the financing is subject to ComVest
finishing its due diligence of the Company and the parties reaching a final
agreement that includes customary closing conditions.

         The Company is obligated to pay a financial advisory and structuring
fee of $500,000 to ComVest, payable in cash or shares of the Company valued at
$0.25 per share at ComVest's election, if the financing does not close within
forty-five days due to the Company's election not to proceed with the financing
without cause or the Company's failure to proceed with the financing in good
faith.

         Upon the closing of the financing transaction with ComVest, Delia
MacIntosh, the spouse of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, will convert the
remaining outstanding debt of the Company in the aggregate amount of
approximately $395,000 into shares of Common Stock and warrants at the same
terms as the financing.
