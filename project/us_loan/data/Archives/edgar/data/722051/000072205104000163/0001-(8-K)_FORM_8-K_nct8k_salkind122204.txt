Item 1.01      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

Item 2.03.     Creation of a Direct Financial  Obligation or an Obligation under
               an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

Item 3.02.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.


On December  22, 2004,  NCT Group,  Inc.  ("NCT")  issued  Carole  Salkind an 8%
convertible note in the principal amount of $13,933,584.56 to cure NCT's default
under three notes  dated June 15,  2004 and two notes dated June 16,  2004.  The
principal  amount of this  December  22,  2004  note  represents  the  aggregate
principal rolled over ($12,193,812.57), default penalty (10% of the principal in
default) and accrued  interest.  The note is secured by substantially all of the
assets of NCT. The note matures on June 22, 2005.  The note bears interest at 8%
per annum until the due date of the note,  and bears  interest at a default rate
of 13% on any  amount  of  principal  or  interest  that is not paid  when  due.
Interest is payable on June 22, 2005. At the election of Ms.  Salkind,  the note
may be  converted  into  839,372,564  shares of NCT common stock at a conversion
price  per share of  $0.0166  or  exchanged  for  shares of common  stock of any
subsidiary  of NCT  (except Pro Tech  Communications,  Inc.) that makes a public
offering of its common stock (at the public offering  price).  The note contains
events of default, any one of which (if not cured) triggers a default penalty of
10% of the then outstanding principal. If triggered,  the default penalty, along
with the outstanding principal and accrued interest, becomes immediately due and
payable.  Events of default  include the failure to pay  principal  and interest
when due and the  failure  to issue  shares of common  stock  upon  exercise  of
conversion rights.

In  conjunction  with this note  issuance,  NCT issued Ms.  Salkind a  five-year
warrant to acquire  229,500,000  shares of NCT common stock at an exercise price
per share of $0.0166.

The issuance of the note and warrant was not registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act relating to  transactions by an issuer not involving a public
offering.

          of $0.0166 per share.
