Item 1.01.     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

Item 2.03.     Creation of a Direct Financial  Obligation or an Obligation Under
               an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

Item 3.02.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.


On December 22, 2004, NCT Group, Inc. ("NCT"), its subsidiary, Distributed Media
Corporation  ("DMC"),  all of the individual members of NCT's Board of Directors
(collectively  with NCT and DMC,  the  "NCT  Parties")  and  Carole  Salkind,  a
beneficial  owner of  approximately  88% of NCT's common  stock,  entered into a
settlement agreement. Under this agreement, Ms. Salkind irrevocably released the
NCT  Parties  from and against all claims  recently  assigned to Ms.  Salkind by
Production  Resource  Group,  LLC ("PRG"),  except as described  below.  The PRG
claims include those asserted by PRG in three pending lawsuits,  two in Superior
Court of the State of Connecticut  and one in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware in and for New Castle County.  In one of the  Connecticut  lawsuits,
PRG's claims  include a claim of  collection on a $2.0 million Offer of Judgment
previously  accepted  by NCT and DMC,  along  with  accrued  interest.  (On that
judgment,  approximately  $135,000  had  been  collected  by  PRG  prior  to its
assignment  of claims to Salkind.) In the Delaware  lawsuit,  PRG sought,  among
other things,  the appointment of a receiver over the business and assets of NCT
and DMC.  In  connection  with her  release,  Ms.  Salkind has agreed to dismiss
(without prejudice) the three lawsuits described above.

In  consideration  for entering  into the  settlement  agreement,  NCT issued to
Carole  Salkind  a  five-year  convertible  note in the  principal  amount of $5
million. The note is secured by substantially all of the assets of NCT. The note
bears  interest,  retroactive  to  December  1, 2004,  at 12% per annum  payable
quarterly in arrears  beginning October 1, 2005, and bears interest at a default
rate of 17% per annum on any interest or  principal  not paid when due. The note
may be prepaid in whole (but not in part) prior to March 31,  2005;  thereafter,
the note may be prepaid in whole or in part under certain circumstances.  At the
election of Ms. Salkind,  the note may be converted into  301,204,819  shares of
NCT common  stock at a conversion  price per share of $0.0166 or  exchanged  for
shares of common stock of any subsidiary of NCT (except Pro Tech Communications,
Inc.) that makes a public  offering of its common stock (at the public  offering
price).  The note  contains  events of  default,  including  the  failure to pay
principal  or interest  when due and the failure to issue shares of common stock
upon exercise of conversion  rights.  Upon an event of default (if not cured), a
default penalty of 10% of the then outstanding principal becomes immediately due
and payable,  as does all accrued  interest and all outstanding  principal.  The
exception is that,  upon an event of default  consisting of a failure to make an
interest  payment  when due and  payable,  a default  penalty of 10% of the then
outstanding  principal becomes  immediately due and payable, as does all accrued
interest, but outstanding principal does not. However, a failure to pay interest
when due and payable  triggers the 10% default  penalty each and every time such
failure occurs.

The settlement  agreement  further provides that unless there is a default under
the note,  Salkind may not  enforce any of the PRG claims or lawsuits  described
above. Upon full  satisfaction of the note,  Salkind's release of the PRG claims
automatically  becomes  unqualified  and Salkind  must  dismiss the PRG lawsuits
described above,  this time with prejudice.  However,  if a default occurs under
the

                                       2

note,  all PRG claims and  lawsuits  against the NCT Parties may  thereafter  be
enforced  by  Salkind,  including  the  lawsuits  previously  dismissed  without
prejudice  and  including  the judgment of $2.0  million  plus accrued  interest
described  above, all to the extent  necessary for full  satisfaction  under the
note.

In conjunction with the issuance of the note, NCT issued Ms. Salkind a five-year
warrant to acquire  82,500,000  shares of NCT common stock at an exercise  price
per share of $0.0166.

The issuance of the note and warrant was not registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act relating to  transactions by an issuer not involving a public
offering.
