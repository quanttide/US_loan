(OTCBB: YPNT), a leading provider of nationwide Internet Yellow Pages and related services, today reported its financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. </FONT></DIV>

<DIV style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.25; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align=left><FONT style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Net revenue for the year ended September 30, 2004 was a record $57,168,105, an increase of approximately 85.8% over net revenue of $30,767,444 in fiscal 2004. The increase in revenue is primarily the result of: (1) an increase in the average number of Internet Advertising Package&#153; (&#147;IAP&#148;) advertisers throughout the year and (2) an increase in monthly pricing. </FONT></DIV>

Operating margins decreased to approximately 22.2% of net revenue in fiscal 2004 from approximately 30.0% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in operating margins was primarily due to a significant increase in the cost of services as a result of increased dilution expense, partially offset by increased revenues and the leveraging of certain fixed expenses over a larger IAP advertiser base.</FONT></DIV>

Pre-tax margins were approximately 24.1% in fiscal 2004 compared to approximately 32.4% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to decreases in operating margins. </FONT></DIV>

Net margins were approximately 15.7% for the year ended September 30, 2004 versus 25.8% for fiscal 2003.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.25; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align=left><FONT style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was $10,069,924, a decrease of approximately 0.9% from net revenue of $10,163,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2003. Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2004 reflected a decrease from net revenue of $16,367,893 in the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and $16,890,361 in the quarter ended June 30, 2004. The decrease in revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a decline in the Company&#146;s paying subscriber base during the second half of fiscal 2004. This decline was largely a result of (1) advertisers changing from Local Exchange Carriers, or LECs, to competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, for their local telephone service, and (2) changes in billing practices by the LECs. The Company addressed these issue
s during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by migrating a large number of its advertisers from direct billing on their local telephone bill to ACH billing, which automatically debits the advertisers&#146; bank accounts. While the Company believes that ACH billing is a more desirable billing method because it is less expensive, has a faster collection time, and presents minimal dilution, the process of converting advertisers from LEC billing to ACH is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can result in missed billings or customer cancellations. In addition, when the LECs unexpectedly changed their billing practices during the fourth quarter, the Company lost the opportunity to bill many of its advertisers for the months of July and August 2004. As a result of these factors, the Company had approximately 196,000 paying IAP advertisers and 327,512 activated IAP advertisers at September 30, 2004 compared to approximately 222,000 paying IAP advertisers and 255,376 activated IAP advertisers at June 30, 2003.</FONT>

Bergmann, YP Corp.'s CEO commented, &#147;YP Corp. reported record earnings again this year despite the fact that fiscal 2004 was a challenging year in many respects. Although the changes in LEC billing practices and the trend towards advertisers switching to CLECs for their local telephone service happened suddenly and unexpectedly in the fourth quarter, we have responded quickly and have taken great strides in reducing the long-term impact on our business. We are resolving the LEC billing issues and we have positioned ourselves to again bill our LEC customers. The migration to ACH billing is ongoing and to date we have migrated over half of our client base to billing methods other than LEC billing.&#148;</FONT></DIV>

We have begun to acquire direct debit information from many of our new accounts as we acquire them. We are contacting all of our direct invoice customers in an effort to switch them to ACH billing, which is less expensive and provides better collections for our company. While these events have significantly increased our costs in the short term, we believe that we will be able to reduce the attrition and costs to implement our new billing method to more normal levels over the next few quarters. In short, we believe that we have addressed these challenges and are positioning our company for stability, profitability, and continued growth in the year ahead.&#148; </FONT></DIV>
