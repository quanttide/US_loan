ITEM 2.04  TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT ACCELERATE OR INCREASE A DIRECT FINANCIAL
           OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT.

     In June 2001, under the terms of the agreement pursuant to which we
acquired tele.ring Telekom Services GmbH ("tele.ring"), our operating company in
Austria, from a subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc ("Vodafone"), an affiliate of
Vodafone agreed to make available to tele.ring an unsecured term loan (the
"tele.ring Term Loan"). As of September 30, 2004 there was $197.3 million
principal outstanding under the tele.ring Term Loan and $17.0 million of accrued
interest. Under the terms of the tele.ring Term Loan, outstanding principal and
accrued interest must be repaid based on predetermined percentages on each of
July 1, 2005, July 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006.

     As previously disclosed, in October 2004, tele.ring received a letter from
Vodafone alleging that tele.ring breached certain of its obligations under the
tele.ring Term Loan. In the letter, Vodafone is also alleging it has the right
to accelerate the maturity of the loan and cause it to become immediately due
and payable. Vodafone and tele.ring are currently utilizing the dispute
resolution procedures in the tele.ring Term Loan to resolve this claim.

     We believe that this claim is wholly without merit and tele.ring is
contesting this claim vigorously. As a result, we have continued to classify the
portion of the tele.ring Term Loan due after September 30, 2005, and accrued
interest, of $142.9 million as long-term debt. If the tele.ring Term Loan were
determined to be in default the Company's $1.55 billion Senior Secured Credit
Facility would be in default. A default that is not cured or waived under the
terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility would cause substantially all of our
and our subsidiaries' other indebtedness to be in default as well. However, we
do not believe that any default under the terms of the tele.ring Term Loan has
occurred and accordingly we do not believe that a rightful notice of
acceleration has been given in accordance with the terms of the tele.ring Term
Loan.
