<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Dear Mr.&nbsp;Wagenheim,


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">As you are aware, Granite City received a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange
Commission dated November&nbsp;30, 2004. We have been researching comment number 12 in that letter
relating to the sale in 2002 of shares of convertible preferred stock with detachable warrants. We
have discussed this matter with Monica Underwood and Company legal counsel and presented
preliminary comments to the Company&#146;s Board of Directors on December&nbsp;16, 2004. We have completed
our research and believe that the accounting for this transaction in 2002 should have included the
calculation of a beneficial conversion feature. Monica has calculated the impact of this
accounting difference and has shared it with you and the Board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">We believe the effect of this difference on the December&nbsp;29, 2002 and December&nbsp;28, 2003 financial
statements is material. Accordingly, this is to advise Granite City Food &#038; Brewery Ltd. that the
financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;29, 2002 and all subsequent annual and interim
periods should be restated. Furthermore, the Company should take the appropriate action to prevent
future reliance on our audit report on each of those annual statements as well as the financial
statements for such interim periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">We will work cooperatively with the Company in this matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Sincerely,
<BR>
Schechter Dokken Kanter
