statements&#148; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of l995 (collectively, &#147;forward-looking statements&#148;). Forward-looking statements relate to various aspects of the Company&#146;s operations and strategies,
including but not limited to the effects of having experienced significant losses in the past and the risk that the Company may incur losses in the future; its sales and royalty forecasts for future periods not being attained, and the risk that the
Company will not conclude additional royalty-bearing license agreements covering its digital technologies; the Company&#146;s marketing, product development, acquisition, investment, licensing and other strategies not being successful; possible
future issuances of debt or equity securities; the possible incurrence of significant patent litigation expenses or adverse legal determinations finding the Company&#146;s patents not to be valid or not to have been infringed; new business
development and industry trends; the Company&#146;s limited liquidity and the possible need to raise additional capital in order to meet the Company&#146;s obligations; reliance on a former affiliate to make contributions to the Company&#146;s
pension plans which are substantially under-funded; and most other statements that are not historical in nature. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements are
described in cautionary statements included in this news release and/or in the Company&#146;s 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004, and
September 30, 2004 filed with the SEC. In assessing forward-looking statements, readers are urged to consider carefully these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this news release, and the Company disclaims
any obligations to update such statements. </FONT></P>
