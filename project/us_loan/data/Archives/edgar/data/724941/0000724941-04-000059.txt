Item 3.01  Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy A Continued Listing
           Rule Or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

     On December 20, 2004, Merisel, Inc. (the "Company") received a notice
from the staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the "Staff") that the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") has denied the Company's appeal of the
Staff's October 1, 2004 decision to delist the common stock of the Company.
Accordingly, the Company's common stock will be delisted effective with the open
of business on December 22, 2004.

     The Panel gave the following reasons for denying the Company's appeal.
First, as announced by the Company on December 3, 2004, the Panel was concerned
about the Company's failure to file a timely Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended September 30, 2004 as required by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).
Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) requires the Company to file copies of any report
required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on or prior to the date
set by the SEC. The Panel acknowledged the Company's position that the delay in
filing was caused by the Company's internal investigation of its former
President and CEO, but nonetheless concluded that an exception could not be made
to the Nasdaq rules because the Company had not presented a plan of compliance
or provided a date by which it anticipated filing the delinquent report.

     Second, as previously announced by the Company on October 4, 2004, the
Staff's original decision to delist the Company was based on the Staff's
conclusion that the Company is not currently engaged in active business
operations. The Panel acknowledged the Company's continuing efforts to acquire
the assets of an operating business, but did not consider the plan to be
sufficiently definite to merit an exception to the Staff's decision to delist a
company that currently is a public shell.

     The Company has not yet determined whether to take action in response
to this notice.


Item 4.01  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

     On December 15, 2004,  Deloitte & Touche LLP  ("Deloitte")  orally informed
the  chair of the  Company's  Audit  Committee  that it was resigning effective
immediately.  On December 16,  2004,  Deloitte  sent the Company a letter dated
the 15th confirming Deloitte's resignation effective on December 15, 2004.
Deloitte's  decision to resign was neither  recommended  nor approved by the
Company's Audit Committee or its Board of Directors.

     Deloitte's report on the Company's consolidated financial statements
for each of the past two years did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer
of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. There have been no disagreements between the Company and
Deloitte for the past two years or the subsequent interim period preceding the
date of Deloitte's resignation on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.


<PAGE>
     Deloitte  has  informed  the  Company  of the  following  reasons  for  its
resignation.  First,  since the Company's sale of various assets and liabilities
to D&H Services LLC in August 2004,  the Company has had no on-going  operations
or  revenues,  other than  interest  income - although  it  continues  to pursue
opportunities  to  acquire  a  new  operating  business.  Second,  Deloitte  has
expressed concern regarding the Company's  investigation of the alleged fraud by
the Company's former  President and CEO, Timothy Jenson,  in connection with the
D&H Services  transaction.  In  particular,  Deloitte had asked that the Company
investigate  whether Mr. Jenson had access to the Company's  financial reporting
system and asked that the Company  investigate  other  transactions in which Mr.
Jenson may have been involved. The Company continues to investigate these issues
and has  informed  Deloitte of this fact,  but due to a  preplanned  move of the
Company's  offices,  the  Company's  computer  system was  unavailable  for such
investigation  until  December 17, 2004.  The move was completed on December 17,
2004,  and the  Company's  computer  systems were once again  operational  as of
December 21, 2004. The Company intends to complete the  investigation  requested
by Deloitte.  Finally, Deloitte advised the Company on December 15, 2004 that it
was unwilling to rely upon the  representations  of the  Company's  current CEO.
This  decision  was based on a  judgment  issued on January  27,  2003 in SEC v.
Dunlap, et al, U.S.D.C.  S.D. Fla., Case No.  01-8437-Civ.,  which set forth the
terms  of a civil  settlement  between  the  Company's  current  CEO and the SEC
relating to the current CEO's employment in the mid-1990s at Sunbeam Corporation
("the Settlement Order"). Prior to hiring the current CEO, however, the Board of
Directors of the Company  carefully  reviewed the  Settlement  Order and related
materials  and  determined  that the current CEO did not admit  liability in the
Settlement  Order and that the terms of the  Settlement  Order did not present a
legal  obstacle  to hiring  the  current  CEO.  The Board of  Directors  further
determined  that the Company's  current CEO was  otherwise  fit for office.  The
latter  two  reasons  given  for  Deloitte's  resignation  constitute  the  only
reportable events under (a)(1)(v) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K for the past two
years  or the  subsequent  interim  period  preceding  the  date  of  Deloitte's
resignation.

     The Company's Audit Committee and Board of Directors have discussed
these  matters  with  Deloitte.  The  Company  has not yet  retained a successor
accountant  but  will  actively  search  for  a new  auditor.  The  Company  has
authorized  Deloitte  to  respond  fully  to  any  inquiries  of  the  successor
accountant,  once retained,  regarding  these matters.

     The Company has provided Deloitte with a copy of the foregoing disclosures,
and  requested a response to the  disclosures.  The Company  promptly  will file
another 8-K when it receives a response from Deloitte.
