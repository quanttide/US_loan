<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>MINDEN, LA. - December 16, 2004
Minden Building &amp; Loan Association, the only locally owned and managed bank in the
community, has announced plans for expansion. A second full-service banking facility will
be constructed on the property commonly known as the &#147;old Wal-Mart parking lot&#148;,
located next to Advance Auto Parts on Homer Road in Minden. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Minden Building &amp; Loan recently
purchased the 12.85-acre property from Madden Contracting Co., Inc., and the James D.
Madden family of Minden. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We are very excited about this
expansion,&#148; said A. David Evans, president and CEO of Minden Building &amp; Loan.
&#147;Our bank has experienced tremendous growth over the past five years since we moved
to our present location of 415 Main Street. We initially thought about expanding this
facility but decided the combination of two bank locations would provide even greater
convenience and service for individuals and businesses in the Minden area.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Evans said the new financial center
will support Minden Building &amp; Loan&#146;s pledge to provide easy and convenient
banking to all customers. Although the facility is currently in the planning stages, Evans
said customers can expect a state-of-the-art banking facility including drive-thru teller
lanes and an ATM machine, as well as the same personal service for which Minden Building
&amp; Loan has become known. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We hope this second location
will provide our current customers with a more convenient banking experience, as well as
encourage new customers to become a part of our banking family,&#148; he said. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As further evidence of Minden
Building &amp; Loan&#146;s dedication to promoting economic development in Minden, Evans
said part of the Homer Road property will be developed to attract new retail stores,
restaurants and professional offices. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P ALIGN="Justify"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We are pleased to pass
ownership of this property to a locally owned company,&#148; said James D. Madden, CEO of
Madden Contracting Co., Inc. &#147;Minden Building &amp; Loan has demonstrated to us all
their commitment of offering a quality hometown banking service to the people of this
area. The purchase of this property to expand and extend their banking service is but
again proof of this commitment.&#148; </FONT></P>
