ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 20, 2004, the Board of Directors of CFS Bancorp, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), approved the Directors' Deferred
Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for compensation paid to non-executive directors
of the Company and its affiliates. The purpose of the Plan is to permit
directors to defer the receipt of fees payable to them for their services as
directors of the Company or any of the Company's affiliates. A copy of the Plan
is attached as an exhibit to this report.

         Under the Plan, a director who elects to participate in the Plan may
elect to defer all or any part of the compensation earned by the director for
services as a director (including cash retainers, fees for attendance at
regularly scheduled board meetings, special meetings called from time to time
and any and all meetings of committees of the board of directors) until a
designated time, the director's death or cessation of service as a director. The
Plan also provides that directors may elect to receive common stock of the
Company in lieu of the cash compensation that would otherwise be payable to
them. In the event a director elects to receive Company stock in lieu of cash
compensation, on the last day of each calendar three-month period, the
director's stock account will be credited with the number of shares determined
by dividing the cash compensation earned by the director during such period by
the fair market value of the Company's stock.

         Benefits paid under the Plan are paid in a single lump-sum
distribution, unless the director elects at the time of the initial deferral to
receive annual installments over a period of five years. All shares of Company
stock credited to a director's stock account will, at the time of distribution,
be distributed in Company stock and all amounts credited to a director's
interest-bearing cash account will be distributed in cash.
