<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) of Stillwater Mining Company (the
&#147;Company&#148;) approved a revised compensation structure for non-employee directors effective January
1, 2005. The principal changes in directors&#146; compensation are stock (1)&nbsp;to change the equity
component of annual compensation from stock options to restricted stock units; and (2)&nbsp;to replace
the per meeting fee for committee chairs with an annual cash retainer. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2005,
non-employee directors will continue to receive annual compensation valued at $50,000, comprised of
cash and Company common stock. However, each director must receive stock valued at least at
$10,000. The remaining balance may be awarded as either cash or additional Company stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Beginning in 2005, each non-employee director will receive each year, on the date of the annual
meeting of stockholders, a grant of common stock valued at $10,000, with restrictions that lapse
upon the earlier of six months following the grant or the director&#146;s death, disability, retirement
or a change in control of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Also beginning in 2005, the Lead Director and Audit Committee chair will receive an annual fee of
$10,000 and each of the chairs of the Compensation, Corporate Governance/Nominating and Health,
Safety &#038; Environmental committees will receive annual fees of $5,000, in lieu of the additional
$500 the chairs currently receive per meeting attended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, directors will continue to receive $2,000 for in-person meetings and $1,000 for
telephonic meetings, as well as to be reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, the Board approved a guideline that non-employee directors should own Company
stock having a value of at least $100,000. Each director is asked to comply with this new
guideline by the fifth anniversary of his or her election to the Board. Current directors are
asked to comply by the date of the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These fees were developed with the assistance of an independent consulting firm and were
recommended to the Board by the Company&#146;s Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee. The
new structure will make the Company&#146;s overall Board fees more competitive, reflect the expected
future market practice when stock option expensing is required and more closely link the directors&#146;
equity compensation with stockholder interests.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, the Board unanimously approved an amendment and restatement (the &#147;Amendment&#148;)
of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated By-Laws (the &#147;By-Laws&#148;), to make certain changes regarding
the indemnification of directors consistent with Delaware law. Following is a summary of the
material changes in connection with the Amendment. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;3.2 and
incorporated herein by reference.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment provides that if any person is involved in any legal proceeding, other than a
proceeding by and in the right of the Company, because such person is or was an officer or director
of the Company, the Company shall indemnify such person for all expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person. The Amendment adds
that such indemnification shall only be made if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s
conduct was unlawful. The Amendment also adds that termination of any such legal proceeding shall
not of itself create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner such
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s conduct
was unlawful.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">With respect to any person who is party to a legal proceeding by and in the right of the Company
because such person is or was an officer or director of the Company, the Company shall indemnify
such person for all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in defense or
settlement of such proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. However, no
indemnification shall be made for any claim as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Company unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which
such action was brought shall determine that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses. Prior to the Amendment, the By-Law indemnification provisions did
not distinguish between actions by and in the right of the Company and other actions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Authorization of Indemnification</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Prior to the Amendment, the By-Laws did not include a formal procedure for authorization of
indemnification. The Amendment requires that any indemnification shall be made by the Company only
as authorized upon a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnified party has met the applicable standard of conduct. This determination shall be made,
with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i)&nbsp;by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action even though less than a quorum,
(ii)&nbsp;by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though
less than a quorum, (iii)&nbsp;if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv)&nbsp;by the stockholders. Such determination
shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the
authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Company. To the extent that a present or former
director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding
described above, such person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment further provides that, for purposes of any determination as described above, a person
shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action, to
have had no reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s conduct was unlawful, if such person&#146;s action
is based on the records or books of account of the Company, or on

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">information supplied to such person by the officers of the Company in the course of their duties,
or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or on information or records given or reports
made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other
expert selected with reasonable care by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Indemnification by a Court</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment adds that notwithstanding any contrary determination or the absence of any
determination, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the
extent otherwise permissible under the By-Laws. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall
be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct. Neither a contrary
determination nor the absence of any determination shall be a defense to such application or create
a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable
standard of conduct.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Expenses Payable in Advance</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The By-Laws previously provided that the Company may advance expenses in its sole discretion. The
Amendment provides that expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any action shall be
paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. Such expenses
incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Nonexclusivity</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment specifies that it is the policy of the Company to indemnify directors and officers
to the fullest extent permitted by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment also adds that indemnification and advancement of expenses shall, unless otherwise
provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Limitation on Indemnification</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment adds that the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer or
advance expenses in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person unless such proceeding
was authorized or consented to by the Board.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Indemnification of Employees and Agents</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Finally, the Amendment provides that the Company may, to the extent authorized by the Board of
Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and
agents of the Company similar to those conferred to directors and officers.
