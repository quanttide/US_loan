<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) of Stillwater Mining Company (the
&#147;Company&#148;) approved a revised compensation structure for non-employee directors effective January
1, 2005. The principal changes in directors&#146; compensation are stock (1)&nbsp;to change the equity
component of annual compensation from stock options to restricted stock units; and (2)&nbsp;to replace
the per meeting fee for committee chairs with an annual cash retainer. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2005,
non-employee directors will continue to receive annual compensation valued at $50,000, comprised of
cash and Company common stock. However, each director must receive stock valued at least at
$10,000. The remaining balance may be awarded as either cash or additional Company stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Beginning in 2005, each non-employee director will receive each year, on the date of the annual
meeting of stockholders, a grant of common stock valued at $10,000, with restrictions that lapse
upon the earlier of six months following the grant or the director&#146;s death, disability, retirement
or a change in control of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Also beginning in 2005, the Lead Director and Audit Committee chair will receive an annual fee of
$10,000 and each of the chairs of the Compensation, Corporate Governance/Nominating and Health,
Safety &#038; Environmental committees will receive annual fees of $5,000, in lieu of the additional
$500 the chairs currently receive per meeting attended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, directors will continue to receive $2,000 for in-person meetings and $1,000 for
telephonic meetings, as well as to be reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, the Board approved a guideline that non-employee directors should own Company
stock having a value of at least $100,000. Each director is asked to comply with this new
guideline by the fifth anniversary of his or her election to the Board. Current directors are
asked to comply by the date of the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These fees were developed with the assistance of an independent consulting firm and were
recommended to the Board by the Company&#146;s Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee. The
new structure will make the Company&#146;s overall Board fees more competitive, reflect the expected
future market practice when stock option expensing is required and more closely link the directors&#146;
equity compensation with stockholder interests.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, the Board unanimously approved an amendment and restatement (the &#147;Amendment&#148;)
of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated By-Laws (the &#147;By-Laws&#148;), to make certain changes regarding
the indemnification of directors consistent with Delaware law. Following is a summary of the
material changes in connection with the Amendment. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;3.2 and
incorporated herein by reference.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment provides that if any person is involved in any legal proceeding, other than a
proceeding by and in the right of the Company, because such person is or was an officer or director
of the Company, the Company shall indemnify such person for all expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person. The Amendment adds
that such indemnification shall only be made if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s
conduct was unlawful. The Amendment also adds that termination of any such legal proceeding shall
not of itself create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner such
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s conduct
was unlawful.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">With respect to any person who is party to a legal proceeding by and in the right of the Company
because such person is or was an officer or director of the Company, the Company shall indemnify
such person for all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in defense or
settlement of such proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. However, no
indemnification shall be made for any claim as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Company unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which
such action was brought shall determine that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses. Prior to the Amendment, the By-Law indemnification provisions did
not distinguish between actions by and in the right of the Company and other actions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Authorization of Indemnification</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Prior to the Amendment, the By-Laws did not include a formal procedure for authorization of
indemnification. The Amendment requires that any indemnification shall be made by the Company only
as authorized upon a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnified party has met the applicable standard of conduct. This determination shall be made,
with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i)&nbsp;by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action even though less than a quorum,
(ii)&nbsp;by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though
less than a quorum, (iii)&nbsp;if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv)&nbsp;by the stockholders. Such determination
shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the
authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Company. To the extent that a present or former
director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding
described above, such person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment further provides that, for purposes of any determination as described above, a person
shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action, to
have had no reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s conduct was unlawful, if such person&#146;s action
is based on the records or books of account of the Company, or on

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">information supplied to such person by the officers of the Company in the course of their duties,
or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or on information or records given or reports
made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other
expert selected with reasonable care by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Indemnification by a Court</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment adds that notwithstanding any contrary determination or the absence of any
determination, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the
extent otherwise permissible under the By-Laws. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall
be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct. Neither a contrary
determination nor the absence of any determination shall be a defense to such application or create
a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable
standard of conduct.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Expenses Payable in Advance</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The By-Laws previously provided that the Company may advance expenses in its sole discretion. The
Amendment provides that expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any action shall be
paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. Such expenses
incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Nonexclusivity</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment specifies that it is the policy of the Company to indemnify directors and officers
to the fullest extent permitted by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment also adds that indemnification and advancement of expenses shall, unless otherwise
provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Limitation on Indemnification</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amendment adds that the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer or
advance expenses in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person unless such proceeding
was authorized or consented to by the Board.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Indemnification of Employees and Agents</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Finally, the Amendment provides that the Company may, to the extent authorized by the Board of
Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and
agents of the Company similar to those conferred to directors and officers.

stockholder&#146;s notice to the secretary of the Corporation shall set forth as to each matter the
stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting (i)&nbsp;a brief description of the business desired to
be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and, in the
event that such business includes a proposal to amend any document, including these Amended and
Restated Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment, (ii)&nbsp;the name and address, as they appear
on the Corporation&#146;s books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii)&nbsp;the class and number

Amended and Restated Bylaws to the contrary, no business to be brought before a meeting of
stockholders by a stockholder shall be conducted at such meeting of the stockholders except in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section&nbsp;2.6. The chairman of the meeting of
stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was
not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of these Amended and
Restated Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such
business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.6, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section&nbsp;2.6.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct of Meetings. The board of directors may adopt by resolution such
rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.
Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the board of
directors, the presiding officer of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority
to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of
such presiding officer, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations and procedures, whether adopted by the board of directors or prescribed by the
presiding officer of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a)&nbsp;the
establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b)&nbsp;rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the
Corporation, theft duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding
officer of the meeting shall determine; (d)&nbsp;restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time
fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e)&nbsp;limitations on the time allotted to questions and/or
comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the board of directors or the
presiding officer of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in
accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; Voting List. The secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days

for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held
(which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting) or, if not so specified, at the place
where the meeting is to be held. The list shall be produced and kept at the place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp; Quorum; Adjournment. Except as otherwise required by law, by the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or by these Amended and Restated Bylaws, the presence, in person or by
proxy, of holders of at least 50% of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders
for the transaction of business. In case a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of
stockholders, the presiding officer of the meeting or a majority in interest of the stockholders
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting
from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed; but only those
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting as originally noticed shall be entitled to vote at any
adjournment or adjournments thereof, provided, however, if the adjournment is for more than thirty
days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
In addition, the board of directors may adjourn a meeting of the stockholders if the board of
directors determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate in order to enable the
stockholders (a)&nbsp;to consider fully information that the board of directors determines has not been
made sufficiently or timely available to stockholders or (b)&nbsp;to otherwise effectively exercise
their voting rights.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp; Voting and Proxies. Subject to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, at every meeting of
the stockholders, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each
share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be
voted on after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. When a
quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of (i)&nbsp;a plurality of votes cast at the
meeting is required for the election of directors and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the stock having voting
power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such
meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the DGCL or other law or of
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express
provision shall govern.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp; Waiver. Attendance of a stockholder of the Corporation, either in person
or by proxy, at any meeting, whether annual or special, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except where a stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. A written waiver of notice of any such meeting signed by a stockholder or
stockholders entitled to such notice, whether

notice in writing to the secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder&#146;s notice shall

less than fifty days nor more than seventy-five days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that
in the event that less than sixty days&#146; notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the
meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such
notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first
occurs. Such stockholder&#146;s notice to the secretary of the Corporation shall set forth (a)&nbsp;as to

stockholder giving the notice, (i)&nbsp;the name and record address of such stockholder, and (ii)&nbsp;the
class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such

may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee
to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election by the
stockholders as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures
set forth herein. The chairman of the meeting of the stockholders shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the
defective nomination shall be disregarded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; Vacancies. Subject to the Stockholders Agreement and except as set forth
in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancy occurring on the board of directors and
any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the board of directors may be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Such newly elected director shall hold such office until his
or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Meetings. The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors
elected at the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held immediately after, and at the same

secretary, the chairman, the president, or the members of the board calling the meeting by
depositing the same in the United States mail, postage prepaid, at least seven (7)&nbsp;days before the
meeting, addressed to the director at the last address he or she has furnished to the Corporation
for this purpose, and any notice so mailed shall be deemed to have been given at the time when
mailed. Notice may also be given at least seventy-two (72)&nbsp;hours before the meeting in person, by
telephone, or by a writing (including prepaid telegram, telex, cablegram, radiogram, facsimile or
similar writing), and such notice shall be deemed to have been given when the personal or telephone

present shall be the act of the board of directors, except as otherwise specifically required by
the DGCL or other law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or these Amended and Restated
Bylaws. If less than a quorum is present, the director or directors present may adjourn the
meeting from time to time without further notice. Voting by proxy is not permitted at meetings of
the board of directors.

business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A written waiver of notice signed
by a director or directors entitled to such notice, whether before, at, or after the time for notice or the time of the meeting, shall be equivalent to the giving of such
notice.

proceedings of the board of directors. Any such consent may be in counterparts and shall be
effective on the date of the last signature thereon unless otherwise provided therein.

participate in a meeting of such board by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such

reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer (as defined below) of the

(including but not limited to attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines (including but not limited to
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee plan) and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in such proceeding, if such person acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause
to believe such person&#146;s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding
by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendre or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that such person&#146;s conduct was unlawful.

Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1. Such determination shall be made,
with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i)&nbsp;by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, (ii)&nbsp;by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such
directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii)&nbsp;if there are no such directors, or if such

acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have
had no reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s conduct was unlawful, if such person&#146;s action is

course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise
or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable

deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to
have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions. As used in this Article&nbsp;6, the following terms have the
following meanings:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Corporation Law. The term &#147;Corporation Law&#148; means the DGCL as it exists on January&nbsp;27,
1995, the date this Article&nbsp;6 is adopted, and as the DGCL may be thereafter amended from time to
time. In the case of any amendment of the DGCL after the date of adoption of this Article&nbsp;6, when
used with reference to an act or omission occurring prior to effectiveness of such amendment
(unless prohibited by law), the term &#147;Corporation Law&#148; shall include such amendment only to the extent that the amendment permits a
corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the DGCL permitted prior to the
amendment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Director or Officer. The term &#147;director&#148; or &#147;officer&#148; means (a)&nbsp;a director of the
Corporation or an officer of the Corporation, and (b)&nbsp;while an individual is a director or officer
of the Corporation, the individual&#146;s serving at the Corporation&#146;s request as a director, officer,
manager, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, other enterprise or employee benefit plan (including without limitation any service as a
director, officer, manager, employee or agent which imposes duties on, or involves services by,
such director, officer, manager, employee or agent with respect to any employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries), and (c)&nbsp;any other position (not with the Corporation itself) in
which a director or officer of the Corporation is serving at the request of the Corporation and for
which indemnification by the Corporation is permitted by the Corporation Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Proceeding. The term &#147;proceeding&#148; means any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit, or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or

would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who
is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article&nbsp;6 with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such
constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. The term &#147;another enterprise&#148; as
used in this Article&nbsp;6 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For purposes of this Article&nbsp;6,
references to &#147;fines&#148; shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to &#147;serving at the request of the Corporation&#148; shall include
any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on,
or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner &#147;not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation&#148; as referred to in this Article&nbsp;6.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnification by a Court. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section&nbsp;6.2, and
notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the
State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Section&nbsp;6.1. The
basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that
indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1. Neither a contrary determination
in the specific case under Section&nbsp;6.2 nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a
defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking
indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for
indemnification pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.4 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the
filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking
indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Expenses Payable in Advance. Expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees)
incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled
to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article&nbsp;6. Such expenses (including
attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so
paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.

interest of the directors in the action, the Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance, in such amounts as the board of directors deems appropriate, on behalf of any person who
is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, against any liability asserted against him or
her and incurred by him or her in any capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether or not he or she is indemnified against such liability or expense under the provisions of
this Article&nbsp;6 and whether or not the Corporation would have the power or would be required to
indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article&nbsp;6 or of the
Corporation Law or by any other applicable law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; Nonexclusive. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by, or granted pursuant to this Article&nbsp;6 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled, under the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or under any other bylaw, agreement, insurance policy, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors, statute, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being

made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article&nbsp;6 shall not be deemed
to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section&nbsp;6.1 but whom the
Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Corporation Law,
or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article&nbsp;6
shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Article&nbsp;6 to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall
be governed by Section&nbsp;6.4), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or
officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses
in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a
certificate, signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the chairman, president or a vice
president and by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or the treasurer or an assistant
treasurer of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him or her in the
Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Facsimile Signatures. Where a certificate of stock is countersigned (i)
by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (ii)&nbsp;by a registrar other than
the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In
case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature or
signatures have been placed upon, any such certificate shall cease to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate is issued,
the certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she
were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer Of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the Corporation shall
be made on the books of the Corporation only upon presentation of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of assignment,
except as may otherwise be expressly provided by the laws of the State of Delaware or by order of a
court of competent jurisdiction. The officers or transfer agents of the Corporation may, in their
discretion, require a signature guaranty before making any transfer.

certificate of stock be issued in place of any certificate issued by the Corporation that is
alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue
of a new certificate, the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance of a new certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed
certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft, or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such
new certificate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Registered Stockholders. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the
person in whose name any shares of stock are registered on its books as the owner of such shares
for all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim or interest in
such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of
such claim or interest, except as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.
