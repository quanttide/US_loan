the option or delivery of shares pursuant thereto might           result in a violation
of any law or regulation of an agency of government or           have an adverse effect

exchange.  </FONT></P>

pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered, or           otherwise subject

consolidation of IFF with or into another corporation as a result of which           IFF
is not the surviving corporation, then the optionee shall have the right (a)           to

after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, or (b) if such
          exercise is no longer possible, to receive in cash for such option the
          difference between (i) the value of the consideration paid for a share of
Common           Stock in such merger or consolidation to holders of Common Stock and
(ii) the           option exercise price of such share, and the option shall cease and
terminate as           to any shares as to which it has not been so exercised or cashed

the Board or the Committee may approve. The terms of such           agreements shall

          any other applicable governmental laws and regulations, unless in the opinion
of           counsel such offering is exempt from registration under such Act, and until
IFF           shall have complied with any applicable provisions of the Securities
Exchange           Act of 1934, as amended, and applicable requirements of the New York

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          Amendment
and Termination of the Plan: The Board may amend, alter, suspend,           discontinue
or terminate the Plan or the Committee&#146;s authority to grant           options under
the Plan without the consent of shareholders or any optionee,           except that any
such action shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders           of IFF at or
before the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders for which the record           date is
after such Board action if such shareholder approval is required by any           federal
or state law or regulation of the rules of any stock exchange or           automated
quotation system on which the Common Stock may then be listed or           quoted, and
the Board may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit           other such
changes to the Plan to shareholders for approval; provided, however,           that,
without the consent of an affected optionee, no such action may materially
          impair the rights of such optionee under any option previously granted to him
or           her (as such rights are set forth in the Plan and in any stock option
agreement           evidencing the grant of such option).  </FONT></P>
