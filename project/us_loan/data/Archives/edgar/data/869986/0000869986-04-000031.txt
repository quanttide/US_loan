     STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated as of December 21, 2004 by
and among ADVANCED PHOTONIX,  INC., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter referred
to as the  "Purchaser")  with  its  principal  offices  at 1240  Avenida  Acaso,
Camarillo, California 93102, and the STOCKHOLDERS (as set forth on Schedule 3.3,
and  hereinafter   collectively  referred  to  as  the  "Sellers")  of  PHOTONIC
DETECTORS,  INC., a California corporation with its principal offices located at
80-A West Cochran Street, Simi Valley, California 93065 (the "Company").

                                R E C I T A L S:

     A. The  Company is in the  business  of the  development,  manufacture  and
distribution  of silicon  photodiodes  and silicon based photo detectors for the
original equipment manufacturer,  commercial,  military,  aerospace, medical and

<PAGE>

     2 PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE STOCK.
     ---------------------------------

     2.1 Purchase and Sale.  The Sellers  hereby this day (the  "Closing  Date")
sell,  assign,  transfer and convey their Ownership  Interests in the Company to
Purchaser or its assigns.  In  consideration  therefore,  Purchaser has this day
delivered to the Sellers the following Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price"):

          2.1.1  Amounts  specified  beside each  Seller's name on Schedule 2.1,
     totaling an aggregate of $975,000 to be paid to the Sellers by certified or
     bank  check  or by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds to the
     accounts  designated  by  Sellers in  writing  (the "Cash  Consideration"),
     subject to  adjustment  as set forth in Section  2.2 below,  and subject to
     terms of the Escrow Agreement;

          2.1.2 At the Closing,  the  Purchaser  shall cause its note payable by
     the  Company in the amount of $25,000 and  guaranteed  by the Sellers to be
     converted into capital of the Company; and

          2.1.3 The number of shares of Purchaser's  Stock set forth beside each
     Seller's name on Schedule 2.1,  having a value in the aggregate of $125,000
     based on the average closing price of the Purchaser's  Stock during the ten
     (10)  Trading  Days  immediately  preceding  December  16, 2004 (the "Stock
     Consideration"),  to be  delivered  to each of the  Sellers  subject to the
     terms of the Escrow Agreement.


     2.2 Adjustment of the Purchase  Price.  The Purchase Price shall be subject
to  adjustment  by the amount (the  "Adjustment  Amount"),  if any, that the Net
Working Capital of the Company as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet is more
(or less) by an amount  greater  than  $20,000  than the Net Working  Capital as
reflected  in the  Interim  Balance  Sheet.  Promptly  after the  Closing  Date,
Purchaser's  Independent  Auditors  shall  perform  a  review  of the  financial
statements  of the Company for the period  beginning  October 31, 2004 and ended
the Closing Date,  including a balance sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet").  The
Closing Balance sheet shall be prepared based on the same accounting principles,
assumptions  and  methodologies  as those used to prepare  the  Interim  Balance
Sheet.  The Closing  Balance  Sheet shall be delivered to Sellers and  Purchaser
within  seventy-five  (75) days after the  Closing  Date.  Upon  delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet,  the Purchase Price will be increased or decreased by the
Adjustment  Amount.  The  Adjustment  Amount  shall be computed  by  subtracting
$92,795.44 (which the parties agree is the Net Working Capital of the Company as
at October 31, 2004  computed as set forth on Schedule  2.2(A)  hereof) from the
Net Working  Capital of the  Company at Closing as shown on the Closing  Balance
Sheet. In the event the Adjustment Amount is positive,  the Purchase Price shall
be increased by the amount of the  Adjustment  Amount,  and within  fifteen (15)
days of the date of which the Closing  Balance  Sheet is delivered to Purchaser,
Purchaser  will deliver the  Adjustment  Amount by certified or bank check or by
wire  transfer of  immediately  available  funds to the accounts  designated  by
Sellers in writing. In the event the Adjustment Amount is negative, the Purchase
Price  shall be reduced by such  amount and Escrow  Agent will pay to  Purchaser
such  Adjustment  Amount out of the  Escrow  Fund  pursuant  to the terms of the
Escrow  Agreement.  Payment  shall be made first out of the cash  portion of the
Escrow Fund and second out of the stock  portion of the Escrow Fund to be valued
based on the average closing price for the Purchaser's Stock during the ten (10)
Trading Days immediately preceding the disbursement. After the adjustment of the
Purchase  Price is  complete,  any  remaining  cash in the  Escrow  Fund will be
returned to Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the
remaining  Shares of the stock  portion of the Escrow  Fund will  continue to be
held in escrow  pursuant to the terms of the Escrow  Agreement.  Any adjustments
required in this  Section will be subject to the dispute  resolution  procedures
set forth in Schedule 2.2(B) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
the Adjustment  Amount is less than $20,000,  whether  positive or negative,  no
adjustment will be made to the Purchase Price pursuant to this section.

                                       2

     2.3 Contingent Purchase Price.

          2.3.1 During the five (5) Contract  Years  following  the Closing Date
     (the "Earn-Out Period"), at the times described below,  Purchaser shall pay
     to Seller an amount equal to 20% of Incremental Net Sales for (i) all sales
     of PDI  Products to the PDI Customer  Base during the  Earn-Out  Period and
     (ii) all Catalog Sales during the Earn-Out Period.

          2.3.2 "Incremental Net Sales" shall mean:

               (a) For the first  Contract Year  following the Closing Date, Net
          Sales in excess of $2,400,000.

               (b) For each subsequent Contract Year during the Earn-Out Period,
          NetSales in excess of the greater of (1) $2,400,000 or (2) the highest
          Net Sales during any prior Contract Year during the Earn-Out Period.

          2.3.3  On or  before  the  30th  day  following  each  Contract  Year,
     Purchaser  shall pay to Seller all amounts owed to Seller  pursuant to this
     Section 2.3 for sales during such preceding Contract Year.  Purchaser shall
     deliver  to Seller  with each such  payment  a written  report  stating  in
     reasonable  detail  Purchaser's  calculations  of such  payment and related
     information.

          2.3.4 Purchaser  shall maintain  accurate books and records related to
     the sale of the PDI  Products to the PDI  Customer  Base and Catalog  Sales
     sufficient to  calculate,  and allow Seller to verify,  the payments  under
     this Section 2.3. From time to time prior to the sixth  anniversary  of the
     Closing Date,  Seller shall have the right to review,  and Purchaser  shall
     provide  access to, such books and  records to verify the  accuracy of such
     payments,  provided that such reviews shall not occur more  frequently than
     once per calendar year. Each such review shall be (i) upon not less than 10
     days' prior notice to Purchaser,  (ii)  conducted  during  normal  business
     hours,  (iii)  conducted by Seller's  independent  accounting firm and (iv)
     conducted in a manner so as to not unreasonably  interfere with Purchaser's
     operations.  If any  such  review  accurately  determines  that  additional
     amounts  are  due to  Seller,  then  Purchaser  shall  pay to  Seller  such
     additional  amounts within 15 days following  Seller's  notice to Purchaser
     thereof.  Seller  shall bear the full cost and expense of each such review,
     except if a discrepancy in Incremental  Net Sales exists in favor of Seller
     in excess of 10% for a period so reviewed (as compared to payments actually
     made regarding such period), then Purchaser shall bear, and promptly pay to
     Seller, the full cost and expense of such review. 1.1.1

          2.3.5 In  connection  with the  transaction,  Robert Kinard and Dennis
     Mattock shall enter into  employment  agreements  with the Purchaser in the
     form attached hereto as Exhibits 6.1.3 and 6.1.4. The expiration or earlier
     termination of either of Messrs.  Kinard's or Mattock's employment with the
     Purchaser  shall have no effect on the  Contingent  Purchase  Price payable
     pursuant to this section.

     valuation  such that a change in  ownership or use (whether now existing or
     in the future) has caused or will cause  additional  ad valorem taxes to be
     imposed upon the properties demised under the Leases.

     PBGC has been  incurred by the  Company or any Common  Control  Entity,  on
     account of the termination of any Pension Plan. The PBGC has not instituted
     proceedings  to terminate  any Pension Plan and to the knowledge of Seller,
     there exists no condition or set of circumstances which could reasonably be
     expected to present a significant  risk of the  termination  of any Pension
     Plan by the PBGC.

          3.26.7 Except as set forth on Schedule  3.26,  none of the Company nor
     any Common  Control  Entity has withdrawn  from a  Multiemployer  Plan in a

     Plan.

          3.26.9 Except as described on Schedule  3.26,  neither the Company nor
     any Welfare  Plan or  Employment  Plan is  obligated to make any payment of
     post-retirement  life,  accidental death,  medical or disability  insurance
     benefits of any type,  excluding,  for this purpose,  the provisions of any
     such benefit as a result of an  individual's  exercise of his or her health
     care   continuation   rights   under  the   Consolidated   Omnibus   Budget
     Reconciliation  Act of 1985,  as amended,  to or with respect to any former

     5 NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISPARAGEMENT.
     ----------------------------------------------------------

     5.1 Non-Competition. Dr. Robert Kinard agrees that he will not for a period
of two (2) years from the Closing  Date and Dennis  Mattock  agrees that he will
not for a period  of one (1) year  from the  Closing  Date,  without  the  prior
written approval of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly,  whether as an owner,
partner, member, employee,  officer,  director or stockholder (other than as the
owner  of less  than 5% of the  stock  of a  corporation  registered  under  the
Securities  and Exchange Act of 1934,  as  amended),  or in any other  capacity,
engage in any business  activity  competitive  with the business of the Company,
which is the development,  manufacture,  distribution and  commercialization  of
optoelectronic  products  (a  "Competing  Activity"),  or (ii)  enter  into  any
agreement or arrangement by means of which either Seller agrees to assist, or in
any other manner facilitate another Person in engaging in a Competing  Activity,
or the supplying of products or furnishing of services to another Person engaged
in a Competing Activity.  Purchasers acknowledge and agree that a breach of this
Section by one of the Sellers individually shall not be the basis for a claim by
the Purchaser  against the  non-breaching  Seller and that  Purchaser's  redress
shall be limited to the breaching Seller.

                                       21
<PAGE>

     5.2  Non-Solicitation.  Each Seller agrees that he will not for a period of
five (5) years from the Closing Date,  directly or indirectly  solicit,  induce,
encourage or attempt to influence any employee,  client,  customer,  salesman or
supplier of the  Company or the  Purchaser  to cease to do  business  with or to
terminate  his  employment  with the  Company  or the  Purchaser,  and shall not
utilize for any such purposes any names and addresses of customers or clients of
the Company or the  Purchaser  or any data on or  relating  to past,  present or
prospective customers or clients of the Company or the Purchaser.

     5.3  Reasonableness  of  Non-Competition  and   Non-Solicitation.   Sellers
acknowledge  and agree that their agreement not to compete and not to solicit is
an incentive for Purchaser to purchase their Ownership Interests pursuant to the
terms  of  this  Agreement,   and  that  the  non-compete  and  non-solicitation
obligations  imposed on each Seller are reasonable in scope and time,  thus such
obligations do not impose  restrictions  which are not necessary to preserve and
protect the Commercial Activities of the Company and of Purchaser.

     5.4  Non-Disparagement.  The Sellers shall not disparage the Company or any
of the Company's partners, shareholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents
or affiliates.

     5.5  Enforcement  of  Non-Competition  and  Non-Solicitation.  If  a  final
judgment of a court or tribunal of competent  jurisdiction  determines  that any
term or provision contained in this Article 5 is invalid or unenforceable,  then
the parties  agree that the court or tribunal  will have the power to reduce the
scope, duration or geographic area of the term or provision,  to delete specific
words or phrases or to replace any invalid or  unenforceable  term or  provision
that is valid and enforceable  that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the  invalid  or  unenforceable  term  or  provision.  This  Article  5 will  be
enforceable  as so modified  after the  expiration  of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.  This Article 5 is reasonable and necessary to protect
and preserve the Purchaser's  legitimate business interests and the value of the
Company and to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on Seller.

          expense  through  counsel  of its own  choosing)  undertake,  conduct,
          control,  at its  expense  and  through  counsel  of its own  choosing
          (subject to the consent of the Indemnified  Party, which consent shall
          not be unreasonably  withheld) the settlement or defense of such claim
          by giving  written  notice of its  intention  to do so not later  than
          twenty  (20) days  following  notice of such claim by the  Indemnified
          Party,  or such shorter time period as required so that the  interests
          of the  Indemnified  Party  would not be  materially  prejudiced  as a
          result of its failure to have received such notice; provided, however,
          that if the  defendants in any action shall include both an Indemnitor
          and an Indemnified  Party, the Indemnified  Party shall have the right
          to select  separate  counsel  to  participate  in the  defense of such
          action on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnitor.

               (b) The  Indemnified  Party shall be entitled to recover from the
          Indemnitor,  on a monthly basis,  all reasonable  attorney's  fees and
          other costs and expenses incurred in the defense of such claim and the
          Indemnified  Party  shall  have  the  right  to  contest,   settle  or
          compromise  any claims in the exercise of its sole  discretion  at the
          expense of the  Indemnitor.  The  Indemnified  Party  shall,  however,
          notify the  Indemnitor  in writing of any  settlement or compromise of
          such claim at least fifteen (15) days prior to any proposed settlement
          or compromise.

               (c) If the Indemnitor  assumes the defense of any such claim, the
          Indemnitor will promptly  reimburse the Indemnified Party for the full
          amount  of  any  loss  resulting  from  such  claim  incurred  by  the
          Indemnified  Party as determined by a Court of competent  jurisdiction
          by authorizing the Escrow Agent to deliver shares of Purchasers  Stock
          to the Indemnified Party. For purposes of this Article 8, the value of
          Purchaser's  Stock shall be  calculated  based on the average  closing
          price  of the  Purchaser's  Class A  Shares  of  Common  Stock  on the
          American  Stock  Exchange for the ten (10) Trading Days  preceding the
          date on which payment for the Claim is made. So long as the Indemnitor
          is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified
          Party  shall not pay or settle  any such  claim  provided  that in the
          event of any such payment of settlement,  the Indemnified  Party shall
          waive any right to indemnity by the Indemnitor.

                                       25

     8.3  Cooperation.  The Indemnitor and Indemnified  Party shall cooperate in
furnishing  evidence and  testimony  and in any other manner which the other may
reasonably  request,  and shall in all other respects have an obligation of good
faith dealing,  one to the other, so as not to unreasonably  expose the other to
an undue risk of loss. The Indemnified  Party shall be entitled to reimbursement
for  out-of-pocket  expenses  reasonably  incurred by it in connection with such
cooperation.  Except for fees and expenses for which indemnification is provided
pursuant  to Article  8.2.2  hereof,  as the case may be, and as provided in the
preceding  sentence,  each party shall bear its own fees and  expenses  incurred
pursuant to this Section 8.3.

                           CERTAIN MATTERS RELATING TO
                     DISPUTE RESOLUTION OF ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT
                     ---------------------------------------

     Section  2.2 of the  Agreement  provides  that the  "Adjustment  Amount" be
computed from the review by the Purchaser's Independent Auditor of the financial
statements  as at the  Closing  Date  which  review  shall be  completed  within
seventy-five (75) days after the Closing, and that any payments required by said
Section 2.2, either from the Purchaser to the Company or from the Company to the
Purchaser,  be made within fifteen (15) business days after such  computation is
completed.

     The  foregoing,  notwithstanding,  the Sellers shall have the right,  to be
exercised by written  notice to the  Purchaser  prior to the  expiration of such
fifteen  (15)  business  day  period,  to extend  such period for payment for an
additional  fifteen  (15) days to  permit an  auditor  chosen  by  Sellers  (the
"Seller's  Independent  Auditor")  to review  such  computation  (including  the
components  of such audited  balance  sheet) to determine  whether it concurs or
disagrees with the amount of the Adjustment Amount so computed.

     In the event the Sellers and the Seller's Independent Auditor disagree with
the computation of the Adjustment Amount, they shall so notify the Purchaser, in
writing,  within such fifteen (15) day period. In such case, the Sellers and the
Purchaser,  and their respective  Independent  Auditors,  shall endeavor in good
faith to reconcile or compromise  their  differences  and agree to an Adjustment
Amount.

     In  the  event  the  Purchaser  and  the  Sellers,   and  their  respective
Independent  Auditors,  fail to reach agreement on the Adjustment  Amount within
such second  fifteen  (15) day  period,  a third firm of  independent  certified
public   accountants  shall  be  selected  by  agreement  between  the  Seller's
Independent Auditor and Purchaser's  Independent Auditor to act as arbitrator of
the dispute.  Such arbitrator shall be instructed to deliver its decision within
thirty (30) days of the time the matter has been presented to it.

     Each party shall bear its own costs in the foregoing  procedure,  including
the fees of its respective Independent Auditor;  provided,  however, that in the
event the  arbitration  provisions of the preceding  paragraph are invoked,  the
party  losing  such  arbitration  will  be  responsible  for  all  costs  of the
arbitrator,  including all fees of the  arbitrator  and all fees and expenses of
the other party's Independent Auditor in conducting such arbitration proceeding.

                                               Susan A. Schmidt  (805) 987-0146

                      ADVANCED PHOTONIX, INC.(R) ANNOUNCES
                     ACQUISITION OF PHOTONIC DETECTORS, INC.


Camarillo, California, December 21, 2004 -

Advanced  Photonix,  Inc. (R) (AMEX - API) announced  today that it has acquired
the outstanding capital stock of Photonic Detectors, Inc. (PDI) for the Purchase
Price of $1,075,000 cash and 113,572 shares of API's Common Stock. The amount of
cash to be delivered is subject to  adjustment to reflect PDI's Balance Sheet as
of the Closing date.

PDI,  based in Simi  Valley,  CA, was founded in 1984 and is a  privately  owned
developer  and  manufacturer  of   optoelectronic   components  and  assemblies,
specializing  in  high-performance   silicon   photodiodes.   PDI  provides  its
technology to several market segments, including industrial control, commercial,
military, medical systems and security.

In commenting  on the purchase,  Paul Ludwig,  API's  President,  stated "We are
pleased to welcome PDI and its  employees  to the API family.  This  acquisition
furthers  our strategy to broaden  API's  customer  base in our target  markets,
specifically the commercial,  industrial, medical and military segments. PDI has
a strong  customer base and several  exciting  growth  initiatives  that we will
support with our full API  resources.  We look forward to welcoming the existing
PDI customers into the Advanced Photonix family of customers."

Ludwig continued, "Additionally, this acquisition provides us the opportunity to
increase  our  operating  margins  by  leveraging  our  existing  overhead  with
increased manufacturing volume. We will accomplish this through consolidation of
the PDI  product  assembly  into our  existing  assembly  and wafer  fabrication
facilities.  We are also pleased to welcome the owners of PDI, Dr. Robert Kinard
and Dennis  Mattock to the API team, who bring with them more than a combined 50
years of optoelectronic design, fabrication and sales experience."

The Company  reported that  Photonic  Detectors,  Inc.  recorded net revenues of
$2.06 million and a net operating loss of ($75,000) for the previous fiscal year
ended March 31, 2004. In the current  fiscal year,  PDI has recorded net revenue
of $1.2  million and a net  operating  loss of  ($101,000)  for the seven months
ended October 31, 2004.  The reported  results for both the previous and current
fiscal years are management representations and do not reflect audited financial
statements.  Despite the recent operating losses, API remained  optimistic about
the prospects for future growth  through cost  leveraging  and increased  market
share.

Richard Kurtz,  Chairman of API commented,  "The PDI acquisition is another step
in the  implementation  of the  "Vision  of  Growth"  that we  presented  to our
shareholders in 2003. This addition to the API family will expand our reach into
our existing markets.  As we move forward,  we will continue this strategy while
simultaneously  seeking  acquisitions  that  will  bring  us  new  technologies,
broadening our market potential and improving shareholder returns."

The information  contained herein includes  forward looking  statements that are
based on assumptions  that management  believes to be reasonable but are subject
to inherent  uncertainties  and risks including,  but not limited to, unforeseen
technological  obstacles  which  may  prevent  or slow  the  development  and/or
manufacture  of new products;  potential  problems with the  integration  of the
acquired  company and its technology and possible  inability to achieve expected
synergies;  obstacles to successfully  combining  product  offerings and lack of
customer  acceptance  of such  offerings;  limited (or slower than  anticipated)
customer  acceptance of new products which have been and are being  developed by
the Company; and a decline in the general demand for optoelectronic products.

Advanced  Photonix,  Inc.(R)  (ASE:  API) is a leading  supplier of  innovative,
silicon-based  electro-optical  products  and design  solutions  to a global OEM
customer base.  Products  include the patented  Large Area Avalanche  Photodiode
(LAAPD) and FILTRODE(R) detectors, as well as PIN photodiodes.  More information
