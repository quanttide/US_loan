<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Bethesda, MD &#150; USEC Inc. (NYSE: USU) announced today that William H. Timbers, president and
chief executive officer, is leaving the Company. James R. Mellor, chairman of USEC, has assumed
the responsibilities of president and chief executive officer and will continue to be supported by
a strong management team.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">The Board will form a committee to conduct an executive search for a successor president and
chief executive officer. The Board expressed its appreciation to Mr.&nbsp;Timbers for the key role he
played in the development and privatization of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Mr.&nbsp;Mellor has been chairman of USEC for the past six years since the privatization of the
Company in 1998. Prior to that time, he served as chairman and chief executive officer of General
Dynamics Corporation, a major company engaged in shipbuilding and marine, combat, and information
systems, and other business areas. He currently serves on numerous boards of directors, including
AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Net2Phone Inc.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">&#147;The Company has transitioned from a government entity to a successful global business and is
now moving forward toward a new phase of diversification and growth. We will remain focused on our
core business of uranium enrichment and our demonstration of the American Centrifuge, which is
expected to be the world&#146;s most efficient commercial uranium enrichment technology,&#148; Mr.&nbsp;Mellor
said. &#147;I look forward to working even more closely with the talented people of USEC in pursuing our
goals.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">USEC Inc., a global energy company, is the world&#146;s leading supplier of enriched uranium fuel
for commercial nuclear power plants.
