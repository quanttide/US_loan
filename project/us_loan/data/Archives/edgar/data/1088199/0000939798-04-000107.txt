Item 8.01 Other Events.

On  November  1, 2004, the registrant filed its Definitive Information Statement
on  Form  14C  announcing  the  action  taken  by a majority of the shareholders
approving  in part an increase in the authorized common shares of the registrant
from 10,000,000,000 common shares to 20,000,000,000 common shares.  The board of
directors  of  the registrant has now determined that the increase in the number
of  authorized  common  shares  is  not  in the best interest of the registrant.
Accordingly,  the  increase  will  not be put into effect by the officers of the
registrant  despite  the  prior  approval  by  the  majority  shareholders.

On  November  3, 2004, the registrant filed a registration statement on Form S-8
registering  options  for  the  purchase  of  4,500,000,000 common shares of the
registrant and 4,500,000,000 common shares underlying those options.  The filing
of  the  Form S-8 also registered an additional 500,000,000 common shares of the
registrant.  These options and shares were to be issued pursuant to the EMPLOYEE
STOCK  INCENTIVE PLAN FOR THE YEAR 2004 NO. 6 and the NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND
CONSULTANTS  RETAINER STOCK PLAN FOR THE YEAR 2004 NO.3.  The board of directors
of  the registrant has now determined to not issued any of the options or shares
registered  pursuant  to  the  Form S-8 filed on November 3, 2004, unless a post
effective  amendment  is  filed greatly reducing the number of options or shares
available  to  be  issued.

                                   SIGNATURES

Pursuant  to  the  requirements  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934, the
registrant  has  duly  caused  this  report  to  be  signed on its behalf by the
undersigned  hereunto  duly  authorized.



                                    LIVESTAR ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC.
