Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Principal Officers

      In an effort to reduce the Company's general and administrative expenses,
as of December 31, 2004 the Company and Frank J. DeMicco mutually agreed to
terminate his employment agreement with the Company. Mr. DeMicco will remain
with the Company as a consultant to continue the sales and marketing of the
Voraxial Grit Separator into the municipal wastewater industry. The Company is
receiving request for proposals and inquiries for projects by municipal
wastewater facilities and Mr. DeMicco's expertise will be utilized to respond to
these opportunities. The Company believes that the change in operations will
reduce general and administrative expenses by approximately $125,000 per year.
Mr. DeMicco had served as the Company's principal operating officer since
January 1, 2003.

      Mr. DeMicco will continue to receive his normal salary compensation
through the termination date of December 31, 2004. In addition, Mr. DeMicco has
vested stock options for 150,000 shares of the Company's common stock which were
earned pursuant to his employment contract.

Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
