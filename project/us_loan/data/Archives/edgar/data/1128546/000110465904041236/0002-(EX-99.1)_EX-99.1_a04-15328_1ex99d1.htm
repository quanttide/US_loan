<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Since this is the last
newsletter of 2004, John and Gary felt it important to recognize the positive
things that have happened to this industry this year, namely:</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">The U.S. Ethanol Hits another
Monthly&#160; Production Record</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The US ethanol industry is setting
new production levels month after month, driving forward to produce nearly 3.5
billion gallons this year.&#160; Currently 81
ethanol plants are operating across the country and approximately 19 more are
under construction. The American Petroleum Institute estimates 30% of America&#146;s
fuel will contain ethanol in 2004.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">Costly Oil Propels Ethanol and
Biodiesel in 2004</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">With crude oil hitting historic
highs, the demand for ethanol has reached unprecedented levels.&#160; Discretionary use of ethanol has dramatically
increased to extend gasoline supplies that are sometimes in short supply.&#160; This additional use of ethanol is helping to
keep ethanol demand high in spite of new production coming on line.</font></p>

Ethanol Tax Measures Into Law</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The 2004 JOBS bill contains
important tax provisions designed to enhance and extend the ethanol tax
incentive through 2010.&#160; The VEETEC
portion of this bill resolves the Highway Trust Fund issue by eliminating any
impact of the ethanol program on the Highway Trust Fund.&#160; It provides new flexibility as to how the
incentive is claimed and will make new markets for ethanol, including E-85 and
E-diesel.&#160; Indeed, the JOBS bill is in
many respects the most pro-ethanol legislation since the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">Wisconsin Legislature to
Consider Mandatory Ethanol Blending in 2005</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">John Malchine, along with a broad
coalition of other ethanol supporters has prepared legislation which is
expected to be introduced during the 2005 legislative session.&#160; If enacted, mandatory blending of ethanol in
Wisconsin would be expanded to the entire state.&#160; Currently only non-attainment areas in and
around Milwaukee are required to use ethanol.&#160;
The legislation is being promoted as <u>good</u> for the environment, <u>good</u>
for energy independence and <u>good</u> for Wisconsin corn producers.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">New Breakthrough in Ethanol Process
Technology</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Companies that produce enzymes
for the ethanol industry are now reporting a significant breakthrough in the
development of a new generation-type enzyme that attacks and digests starch
molecules without the need for cooking and liquefaction at the beginning of the
process.&#160; This is expected to result in a
significant reduction in the total amount of energy needed to process ethanol.&#160; Other benefits from this technology include
reduced infection, higher starch conversions to ethanol, higher amounts of
protein in distillers.&#160; The front end of
the ethanol production process will be forever changed as we now know it.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">Seed Corn Industry Partners
with Ethanol Industry to Improve Production Process</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Monsanto and Pioneer Seeds have
both established programs to emphasize the planting of highly fermentable
starch varieties of corn.&#160; Both companies
have identified within their own production lines the varieties that have shown
up to 10% more ethanol per bushel of corn.&#160;
Over time, ethanol yields from specific varieties will continue to
increase as genetic selection continues.</font></p>

Renewable Source of Hydrogen for Fuel Cells</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Renewable Fuels Association recently
released a paper highlighting the potential synergies for ethanol and fuel
cells.&#160; Ethanol is easily stored and
dispensed in the current fueling system and generates fewer greenhouse
gas-forming emissions than conventional fuels.&#160;
Tests have demonstrated that ethanol is more efficient to reform than
gasoline to provide hydrogen for fuel cells.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The USDA&#146;s November report estimated this
year&#146;s corn crop to average 160.2 bushels per acre.&#160; The market is slowly recovering from the
shock of the size of these yields and will soon get to guess what next year&#146;s
will look like.&#160; I choose the word &#147;guess&#148;
carefully.&#160; As mentioned in prior
newsletters, the job of predicting how many bushels we get to work with becomes
more and more volatile as the range of yields become wider and wider.&#160; Does anyone know what normal is?&#160; Is normal 160.2 bushels per acre or 129.3
bushels per acre?&#160; This is the variation
we have seen just over the last few years and equates to a difference of close
to 2.5 billion bushels.&#160; What happens if
you throw in a real weather threat or another bumper crop?&#160; If anyone knows the answer please forward it
to the office.&#160; Until then we will keep
our discipline of preserving profit and extending protection while the
opportunity presents itself.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">BSE is working hard to explore the genetic
traits of high fermentable corn varieties.&#160;
We will be running some interesting trials this winter and will share
the results with you as they become available.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The ethanol market has remained very strong
thanks in part to an historically high energy market&#160; BSE continues to look for business well into
next year.&#160; The ethanol market is
anxiously awaiting some key decisions to be made in Atlanta to see if we can
add some significant additional blending demand.&#160; Stay tuned.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">At Badger State Ethanol we&#146;ve seen our second summer arrive and depart.
&#160;Cooler weather marks the arrival of new
crop corn.&#160; It&#146;s always nice to finish
grinding the bottom of the bins and get into some new corn.&#160; Cooler weather also eases the demands placed
on the plant&#146;s cooling system.&#160; More
capacity in the cooling system gives us more margin for cooling fermenters
without using the backup chilling system.&#160;
Cooler weather also provides less favorable conditions for infectious
organism growth in the plant</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WINBCO is still hard at work constructing Badger State Ethanol&#146;s fourth
fermenter.&#160; We expect the tank to be
completed on November 16.&#160; As soon as the
tank is completed the contractors can begin extending the building, and Topp&#146;s
Mechanical will finish the installation of the heat exchanger, pumps and piping
associated with the fermenter.&#160; With a
little bit of luck the project should be completed by late November or early
December.&#160; We&#146;re all anxious to see the
benefits that this vessel will provide to the plant.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Badger State Ethanol has experienced a couple of milestones over the
last few months.&#160; On October 30, we set a
one day production record of 148,388 gallons!&#160;
In late November we accomplished another milestone in creating in excess

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Jim Leitzinger is the &#147;numbers cruncher&#148; at Badger State Ethanol.&#160; As the Controller/CFO since July 2002 he has
had primary responsibility for finding a suitable provider for health care
coverage, implementing a 401-K retirement savings plan, pre-tax flexible
spending program and life and disability coverage.&#160; These incentives make BSE a very attractive
employer.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Change was the constant as inventory and accounting systems
developed.&#160; Due to Jim&#146;s input, Badger
State has one of the few fully integrated inventory and accounting systems in
the ethanol business.&#160; He says, &#147;If it
doesn&#146;t get recorded, it doesn&#146;t exist&#148;.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Jim, as custodian of the company&#146;s assets, has a multitude of duties in
a day including finance and cash flow maintenance to payroll and more.&#160; The company has saved thousands of interest
by financing improvements and additions with the operating cash flow.&#160; We have paid for the RTO, fifth centrifuge,
blower skid and housing for the CO2 plant and the fermenter addition without
adding to our debt.&#160; Jim has been an
integral part of adding to the plant&#146;s efficiency and the positive bottom line.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">As an Edgewood College graduate and CPA, Jim came to BSE with
controller experience, the last of which was with the City of Freeport,
Illinois as Director of Finance.&#160; He and
his wife live in Shullsburg, Wisconsin.&#160;
They have four children.&#160; Jim
says, &#147;I love this area of the country and consider myself fortunate to be a
part of this opportunity called Badger State Ethanol.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Jim is quoted as saying, &#147;As we approach our year end, I see a year
where our plant appeared to come into its own.&#160;
This is a year that did not include the amounts of production incentives
that we received the prior year and yet we are looking at a bottom line that
will compare favorable to last year.&#160; I
look forward to future communications and seeing all of you at our next annual
meeting.&#148;</font></p>
