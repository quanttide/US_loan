modification of the consent order and release dated January 27, 2003, that resolved a lawsuit filed by the Department of Labor in March 2002. The amended consent order has been filed with district court in California and will be effective when
entered by the court. The amended consent order provides for a change in the appraisal methodology used in connection with annual appraisals for Holding&#146;s stock bonus plan, reduces &#147;floor price guaranty&#148; set forth in the original
consent order from $4.25 to $2.15 per share to reflect the changes in the appraisal methodology and the effect of the special contribution and allows Holding and EMJ to proceed with its proposed merger and financial restructuring. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">To offset the effects of the change of appraisal methodology required by the amended consent
order, Holding committed to make a special contribution of additional shares of Holding common stock or its equivalent to its stock bonus plan, a supplemental stock bonus plan, and a cash bonus plan. The special contribution will consist of
2,496,703 shares of Holding common stock or its equivalent to the plans for current employees, and cash bonuses paid through the new cash bonus plan of $1,416,905 in the aggregate to participants who are no longer employed by EMJ. The stock
contribution will be made over the next two years to comply with applicable Internal Revenue Code regulations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of EMJ, and an Exchange Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2004, among Holding, EMJ
and Kelso Investment Associates IV, L.P. and certain of its affiliates. The merger and financial restructuring will result in the conversion of all of the outstanding debt and equity securities of Holding to common stock of EMJ and/or cash. Kelso is
the holder of Holding&#146;s outstanding Series A Variable Rate Notes and also is Holding&#146;s controlling stockholder. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The merger and financial restructuring is contingent upon the simultaneous completion of an initial public offering of EMJ&#146;s common stock. EMJ filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in connection with the proposed public offering, on October 1, 2004. The proceeds of the public offering are expected to be used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration for
Holding&#146;s securities in the merger and the value of the shares of EMJ common stock issued in the merger will be established by the public offering price. The transaction will not affect EMJ&#146;s day-to-day operations, and EMJ&#146;s
customers, suppliers and employees will continue to deal with EMJ. Holding filed an amendment to its registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission today in connection with registration of EMJ common stock to be
issued in the merger and financial restructuring and the solicitation of the approval of the transaction by Holding&#146;s stockholders. EMJ anticipates that a meeting of Holding&#146;s stockholders will be held to address the merger and financial
restructuring in the first calendar quarter of 2005. There is no assurance that the proposed merger and financial restructuring will be approved by the requisite votes of Holding&#146;s stockholders or that the other conditions to completion of the
transaction will be satisfied. Thus there can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
