Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors;
          Appointment of Principal Officers.

On December 21, 2004 the registrant received written communications from
directors Eugene Peiser and Patrick Galuska that they were resigning from the
registrant's board of directors effective immediately.

The registrant believes Mr. Peiser's and Mr. Galuska decisions were based upon
their agreement with the registrant's need to reduce its corporate governance
expense resulting from having a seven person board of directors and the
uncompensated time requirements of director participation.

The registrant agrees with Mr. Peiser's and Mr. Galuska's decisions,
acknowledges their good faith in coming to their decisions and desires to thank
them for their service to the corporation.

The written communications received from Mr. Peiser and Mr. Galuska are exhibits
to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The registrant has provided Mr. Peiser and Mr. Galuska with a copy of this
Current Report prior to the filing thereof and informed Mr. Peiser and Mr.
Galuska that they have the opportunity to provide the registrant with
correspondence stating whether they agree or disagree with the disclosure
contained in this Current Report which the registrant would also file such
correspondence as an exhibit to this Current Report or an amendment thereto.
