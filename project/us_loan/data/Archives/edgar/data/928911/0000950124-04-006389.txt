<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ITEM 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective December&nbsp;15, 2004, Cascade Bank, the banking subsidiary of
Cascade Financial Corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), adopted the Cascade Bank
Deferred Compensation Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). The purpose of the Plan is to permit a
select group of management or highly compensated employees who contribute
materially to the continued growth, development and future business success of
Cascade Bank to make pre-tax deferrals of cash compensation and accrue interest
on such deferred amounts. The Company is also permitted to make contributions
to the Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation was required to adopt the Plan as a condition of its
acquisition of Issaquah Bancshares, Inc. (&#147;Issaquah&#148;), which was consummated
on June&nbsp;4, 2004. The Plan satisfies a requirement of the former Issaquah chief
executive officer&#146;s employment agreement which was assumed in connection with
the transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any election deferrals must be made prior to the date in which the
compensation to be deferred will be earned. The Plan will be administrated by
the Plan Administrator which shall consist of the Compensation and Personnel
Committee of the Board, or such committee or person(s) as the Board shall
appoint. Deferred compensation is generally payable upon termination of
employment with the Corporation, change of control of the Corporation, or
otherwise as specified in the Plan.

                                  CASCADE BANK
                           DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

      The purpose of this Plan is to provide specified benefits to a select
group of management or highly compensated employees who contribute materially to
the continued growth, development and future business success of Cascade Bank
(the "Company"). This Plan shall be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes
of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), as
amended from time to time.

                                    ARTICLE 1

      voluntarily deferred or contributed by the Executive pursuant to all
      qualified or non-qualified plans of any Employer and shall be calculated
      to include amounts not otherwise included in the Executive's gross income
      under Code Sections 125, 402(e)(3), 402(h), or 403(b) pursuant to plans
      established by any Employer; provided, however, that all such amounts will

      plan, the amount would have been payable in cash to the Employee.

1.3   "Beneficiary" means each designated person, or the estate of the deceased
      Executive, entitled to benefits, if any, upon the death of the Executive
      determined pursuant to Article 7.

      discretion, awarded to the Executive for the Plan Year.

1.6   "Beneficiary Designation Form" means the form established from time to
      time by the Plan Administrator that the Executive completes, signs and

            (b)   A deliberate act of proven fraud having a material adverse
                  impact on the business or consolidated financial condition or

      shall be effective until received, accepted and acknowledged in writing by
      the Plan Administrator or its designated agent.

7.4   No Beneficiary Designation. If the Executive dies without a valid
      beneficiary designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the
      Executive, then the Executive's spouse shall be the designated
      Beneficiary. If the Executive has no surviving spouse, the benefits shall
      be made payable to the Executive's estate.

7.5   Facility of Payment. If the Plan Administrator determines in its
      discretion that a benefit is to be paid to a minor, to a person declared
      incompetent, or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of that
      person's property, the Plan Administrator may direct payment of such
      benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care or
      custody of such minor, incompetent person or incapable person. The Plan
      Administrator may require proof of incompetence, minority or guardianship
      as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit. Any
      payment of a benefit shall be a payment for the account of the Executive
      and the Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge
      of any liability under the Plan for such payment amount.

10.2  Review Procedure. If the Company denies part or all of the claim, the
      claimant shall have the opportunity for a full and fair review by the
      Company of the denial, as follows:

      10.2.1 Initiation - Written Request. To initiate the review, the claimant,
            within 60 days after receiving the Company's notice of denial, must
            file with the Company a written request for review.

      10.2.2 Additional Submissions - Information Access. The claimant shall
            then have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents,
            records and other information relating to the claim. The Company
            shall also provide the claimant, upon request and free of charge,
            reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and
            other information relevant (as defined in applicable ERISA
            regulations) to the claimant's claim for benefits.

      10.2.3 Considerations on Review. In considering the review, the Company
            shall take into account all materials and information the claimant
            submits relating to the claim, without regard to whether such
            information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit
            determination.

      10.2.4 Timing of Company Response. The Company shall respond in writing to
            such claimant within 60 days after receiving the request for review.
            If the Company determines that special circumstances require
            additional time for processing the

                                       12
<PAGE>

            claim, the Company can extend the response period by an additional
            60 days by notifying the claimant in writing, prior to the end of
            the initial 60-day period, that an additional period is required.
            The notice of extension must set forth the special circumstances and
            the date by which the Company expects to render its decision.

      10.2.5 Notice of Decision. The Company shall notify the claimant in
            writing of its decision on review. The Company shall write the
            notification in a manner calculated to be understood by the
            claimant. The notification shall set forth:

            (a)   The specific reasons for the denial;

            (b)   A reference to the specific provisions of the Plan on which
                  the denial is based;

            (c)   A statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon
                  request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies
                  of, all documents, records and other information relevant (as
                  defined in applicable ERISA regulations) to the claimant's
                  claim for benefits; and

            (d)   A statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action
                  under ERISA Section 502(a).

                           AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION

11.1  Termination. The Company reserves the right to terminate this Agreement at
      any time by action of its Board. Upon the termination of the Agreement,
      the Executive's Deferral Account balance shall be determined (i) as if the
      Executive had experienced Early Termination on the date of Plan
      termination; or (ii) if Plan termination occurs after the Executive's
      Normal Retirement Age and the Executive has not retired, then with respect
      to that Executive as if he/she had retired on the date of Plan
      termination. The Executive shall elect, upon commencement of this
      Agreement, to receive the Deferral Account balance (i) in a lump sum
      within ninety (90) days of termination of this Agreement; or (ii) in
      installments over forty-eight (48) months. The termination of the Plan
      shall not adversely affect the amount of any benefit payments the
      Executive has become entitled to under the Plan as of the date of
      termination.

11.2  Amendment. The Company may, at any time, amend or modify this Agreement in
      whole or in part by the action of its Board; provided, however, that no
      amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the
      value of Executive's Deferral Account balance in existence at the time the
      amendment or modification is made; and further provided that the Company
      shall have the right to accelerate applicable installment payments by
      paying the Deferral Account balance in a lump sum within thirty (30) days
      following such amendment.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

12.1  Binding Effect. This Plan shall bind the Executive and the Company and
      their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, administrators and transferees.

12.2  No Guarantee of Employment. This Plan is not a contract for employment. It
      does not give the Executive the right to remain an employee of the
      Company, nor does it interfere with the Company's right to discharge the
      Executive.

12.3  Non-Transferability. Benefits under this Plan cannot be sold, transferred,
      assigned, pledged, attached or encumbered in any manner.

12.4  Tax Withholding. The Company shall withhold any taxes that are required to
      be withheld from the benefits provided under this Plan.

12.5  Applicable Law. The Plan and all rights hereunder shall be governed by the
      laws of Washington, except to the extent preempted by the laws of the
      United States of America.

12.6  Unfunded Arrangement. The Executive and the Beneficiary are general
      unsecured creditors of the Company for the payment of benefits under this
      Plan. The benefits represent the mere promise by the Company to pay such
      benefits. The rights to benefits are not subject in any manner to
      anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance,
      attachment, or garnishment by creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's
      life is a general asset of the Company to which the Executive and the
      Beneficiary have no preferred or secured claim.

12.7  Reorganization. The Company shall not merge or consolidate into or with
      another company, or reorganize, or sell substantially all of its assets to
      another company, firm, or person unless such succeeding or continuing
      company, firm, or person agrees to assume and discharge the obligations of
      the Company under this Plan. Upon the occurrence of such event, the term
      "Company" as used in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to the successor
      or survivor company.

12.8  Entire Agreement. This Plan and ancillary documents constitute the entire
      agreement between the Company and the Executive as to the subject matter
      hereof. No rights are granted to the Executive by virtue of (i) this Plan
      other than those specifically set forth herein; or (ii) the Election Form
      other than those specifically set forth therein.

12.9  Interpretation. Wherever the fulfillment of the intent and purpose of this
      Plan requires, and the context will permit, the use of the masculine
      gender includes the feminine and use of the singular includes the plural.

12.10 Alternative Action. In the event it shall become impossible for the
      Company or the Plan Administrator to perform any act required by this
      Plan, the Company or Plan

                                       14
<PAGE>

      Administrator may in its discretion perform such alternative act as most
      nearly carries out the intent and purpose of this Plan and is in the best
      interests of the Company.

12.11 Headings. Article and section headings are for convenient reference only
      and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its
      provisions.

12.12 Validity. In case any provision of this Plan shall be illegal or invalid
      for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
      remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as
      if such illegal and invalid provision has never been inserted herein.

12.13 Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Plan
      Administrator under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and
      hand-delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the address
      below:

                  Compensation and Personnel Committee
                  Cascade Bank
                  2828 Colby Ave.
                  Everett, Washington, 98201

      Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if
      delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark or the
      receipt for registration or certification.

      Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Executive
      under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or
      sent by mail, to the last known address of the Executive.
