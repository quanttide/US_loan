      -     I understand that annually I must review or revise the amount and

            time, only if said election is made at least twelve (12) months
            prior to the starting date for the distribution previously elected,

            and is effective to delay the original distribution for not less
            than 5 years from the date the previously-elected distribution was
            to commence.

      -     A Company Contribution equal to the greater of Fifteen thousand
            dollars ($15,000) or the Company Contribution paid to executives in
            comparable positions for a period of five (5) years provided Ittes
            continues his employment during such five (5) year period. Partial
            years shall be pro-rated.

      -     Company Contributions to the Deferral Account of Ittes during the
            first five (5) years of employment shall be fully vested on
            completion of the year of service for which they are contributed.

      -     By executing this Election Form, I acknowledge and agree that the
            Cascade Bank Deferred Compensation Plan satisfies the first year
            requirement of paragraph 8, Deferred Compensation Plan, of my
            Employment Agreement dated February 11, 2004.
