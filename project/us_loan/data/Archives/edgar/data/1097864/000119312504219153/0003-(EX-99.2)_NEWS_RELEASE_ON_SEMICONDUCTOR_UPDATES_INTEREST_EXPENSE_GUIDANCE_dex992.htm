today announced that it has successfully purchased $195 million principal amount of its 12 percent Senior Secured Notes due 2008 and $130 million principal amount of its 12 percent Senior Secured Notes due 2010 previously issued by the company and
Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, comprising 100% of the outstanding notes of each series. The purchase of notes was financed with approximately $71 million of cash on hand and $325 million of new borrowings under an amendment and

which is offset by the $325 million reduction of Senior Secured Notes. The $645.5 million senior secured credit facilities will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300 basis points. Due to debt prepayment costs associated with this transaction,
the company no longer expects to be profitable on a U.S. GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2004, as previously guided. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
