It is expected that during December 2004, a single series of certificates,
entitled CHL Mortgage Pass-Through Trust 2004-29, Mortgage Pass-Through

a pooling and servicing agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), to
be entered into by and among CWMBS, Inc, as depositor, Countrywide Home Loans,
inc., as a seller, Park Granada LLC, as a seller, Countrywide Home Loans
Servicing LP, as master servicer and The Bank of New York, as trustee. Certain

registered under the Registrant's registration statement on Form S-3 (no.

pursuant to an underwriting agreement to be entered into by and between the

     In connection with the expected sale of the Underwritten Certificates,
the Registrant has been advised that one or more of the Underwriters has
