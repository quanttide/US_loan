our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking
statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words
such as &ldquo;expects,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipates,&rdquo; &ldquo;intends,&rdquo; &ldquo;plans,&rdquo; &ldquo;believes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;seeks,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimates,&rdquo; or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as

their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements speak only as of the date they
are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise
after the date the forward looking statements were made. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control that
could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements.
