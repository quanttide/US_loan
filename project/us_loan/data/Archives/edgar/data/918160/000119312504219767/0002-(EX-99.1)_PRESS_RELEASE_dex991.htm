Redemption of Senior Notes </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">MIDDLETOWN, OH, December 27, 2004 &#151; AK
Steel (NYSE: AKS) said that it completed on December 24, 2004 the redemption of the remaining $117.4 million principal amount of its 9% Senior Notes Due 2007, and the remaining $33.5 million principal amount of its 8 7/8% Senior Notes Due 2008. The
redemption of the notes, substantially ahead of their scheduled maturity dates, will eliminate approximately $14 million of annual interest expense attributable to the notes, beginning in 2005. The redemption will result in a one-time charge in the
fourth quarter of 2004 of approximately $5.4 million related to the call premium and certain unamortized costs associated with the original issuance of this debt. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

on the company&#146;s improved financial performance and cash position. AK Steel now has no scheduled material debt maturities until 2009. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

anticipated required pension funding of approximately $300 million due in 2006. The 2005 payment will reduce the company&#146;s 2006 projected pension funding obligation by approximately 50%, as well as lower its annual pension expense by
approximately $13 million. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Headquartered in Middletown, Ohio, AK Steel
