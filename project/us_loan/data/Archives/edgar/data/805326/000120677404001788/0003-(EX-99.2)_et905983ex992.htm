<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Under the terms of the commitment, Emisphere may draw funds from Kingsbridge, at its discretion, in amounts up to 3% of the Company&#146;s market capitalization at the time of the draw.&#160; In exchange for each draw, Emisphere will sell to Kingsbridge newly issued shares of common stock priced at a discount of between 8-12% of the average trading price of the Company&#146;s stock during the financing period, with the reduced discount applying if the price of the common stock is equal to or greater than $8.50.&#160; Emisphere will control the minimum acceptable purchase price of any shares to be issued to Kingsbridge during the term of the agreement.&#160; Emisphere&#146;s right to begin drawing funds will commence upon the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring effective a registration statement to be filed by the Company. </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Emisphere is under no obligation to access any of the capital available under this commitment.&#160; In addition, Emisphere can participate in other debt or equity financings without restriction, provided that such financings do not use any floating or other post-issuance adjustable discount to the market price of Emisphere&#146;s common stock. Kingsbridge is precluded from short selling any of Emisphere&#146;s shares during the term of the agreement.&#160; In return for the commitment, Emisphere issued to Kingsbridge a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at a premium to the current market price.</font></p>
