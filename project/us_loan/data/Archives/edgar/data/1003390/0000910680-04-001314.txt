      Silverstar Holdings Announces Early Repayment of Approximately $5.4
                  Million of its South African Note Receivable

  Based on Current Exchange Rates Company Anticipates Realizing a Further Gain
                     for the Quarter in Excess of $500,000


BOCA RATON, FL- (MARKET WIRE)- December 20, 2004 - Silverstar Holdings, Ltd.
(Nasdaq:SSTR) reported today that it had entered into an agreement with Salwin
Investments (Pty) Ltd, for the early repayment of approximately $5.4 million of
the $8.5 million owed by Salwin to the Company. Under the terms of the
agreement, Salwin will continue to pledge an approximate 18% stake in First
Lifestyle Holdings as collateral for repayment of their remaining indebtedness.


Due to significant strengthening of the South African Rand against the US
dollar, and based on current exchange rates, the Company anticipates posting a
further realized gain of approximately $500,000 on this note during the current
quarter.


Clive Kabatznik, Chief Executive Officer of Silverstar Holdings, said: "The
early repayment of a significant portion of our South African notes receivable
comes at a propitious time. It enables us to capitalize on the significant
strengthening of the South African Rand over the past 24 months. Additionally,
over the past two-years, we have posted consistent unrealized foreign currency
gains; this transaction not only allows us to realize a significant portion of
these unrealized gains, but also reduces our foreign currency exposure going
forward.


Mr. Kabatznik continued, "At current exchange rates, our balance sheet will now
consist of approximately $6.4 million in cash, a further $3.9 million in notes
receivable with minimal debt at the corporate holding level. Our investment in
Magnolia Broadband is carried at a fairly conservative valuation and the
carrying value of Fantasy Sports is in line with its current operating results.
Our share price has traditionally traded at a discount to our net asset value
and this transaction reaffirms the quality of the Company's assets."

Mr. Kabatznik concluded, "We continue to actively seek appropriate opportunities
to enhance our revenues and income both organically and through acquisitions.
Our increased cash balances will provide us with greater flexibility, in this
regard."
