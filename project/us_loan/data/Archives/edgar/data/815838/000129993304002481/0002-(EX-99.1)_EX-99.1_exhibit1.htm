<P align="center" style="font-size: 16pt"><FONT style="font-size: 14pt"><B>NOVEN EARNS MILESTONE PAYMENT<BR>
UNDER P&#038;G COLLABORATION</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 14pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt"><B>MIAMI, FL., December&nbsp;29, 2004 </B>&#150; Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NOVN) today announced
that it has earned a $3.0&nbsp;million success fee for attaining a development milestone under its
development collaboration with P&#038;G Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of The Procter &#038; Gamble
Company. Noven expects to report the $3.0&nbsp;million success fee as license and contract revenues for
the quarter ending December&nbsp;31, 2004.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">In light of the success fee, Noven also updated its previously issued financial guidance for
full-year 2004. Noven currently expects its earnings per share for full-year 2004 to be in the
$0.45 to $0.50 range and its 2004 net revenues to exceed 2003 levels. This guidance is based on
Noven&#146;s current assumptions and expectations regarding the business and operations of Noven and
Novogyne Pharmaceuticals (Noven&#146;s women&#146;s health products company owned jointly with Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Actual financial results could differ materially if these
assumptions or expectations prove to be incorrect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Noven, headquartered in Miami, Florida, is a leading developer of advanced transdermal drug
delivery technologies and prescription transdermal products. Noven&#146;s prescription patches are
approved in over 30 countries, and a range of new patches are being developed in collaboration with
Novartis Pharma AG, Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc, Procter &#038; Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Endo
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and others. Together with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Noven owns
Novogyne Pharmaceuticals, a profitable women&#146;s health products company with 2003 sales of over $100
million. Among other products, Novogyne markets and sells Noven&#146;s Vivelle-Dot&#174; product &#151; the
smallest estrogen patch in the world, and the most dispensed transdermal estrogen product in the
U.S. Noven is committed to expanding the universe of available transdermal therapies for the
benefit of patients, partners and shareholders. See www.noven.com for additional information.

the Securities Act of 1933 and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. When used in
this press release, the words &#147;expects&#148; and &#147;could&#148; identify certain of such forward-looking
statements. Readers are cautioned that actual results, performance or achievements could differ
materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements
contained herein. These forward-looking statements are based largely on the current expectations
of Noven and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on
factors which are, in many instances, beyond Noven&#146;s control. These risks and uncertainties
include but are not limited to: the inherent uncertainties associated with financial projections;
the possibility that one or more assumptions underlying Noven&#146;s financial guidance may prove to be
incorrect, including the assumptions that there will be no additional recalls of CombiPatch beyond
the one lot described in Noven&#146;s </I><I>Form 10-Q</I><I> for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, and that there
will not be any unforeseen material transactions, changes in Noven&#146;s or Novogyne&#146;s accounting or
accounting principles, developments regarding regulatory matters or clinical studies, changes in
the supply of, demand for, or distribution of Noven&#146;s HT products (including any changes resulting
from the impact of competitive HT products that have been launched in 2004); the risk that Novogyne
may not be able to realize the full value of the marketing rights for Noven&#146;s CombiPatch product;
uncertainties regarding the timing and magnitude of any product recall, including those which may
be related to the CombiPatch stability issue discussed in Noven&#146;s </I><I>Form 10-Q</I><I> for the quarter ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004 and, in particular, the risk that additional lots of CombiPatch could be
recalled if Noven&#146;s stability testing related to the October&nbsp;2004 stability failure reveals that
additional lots do not meet specification; risks and uncertainties related to the fact that the
decision to recall product resides with Novartis as the holder of the CombiPatch NDA and is not
within Noven&#146;s control; the possibility that Noven&#146;s or Novogyne&#146;s estimates of the impact of
future returns and other charges may prove inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise incorrect; the
impact of detected or undetected product stability failures or other product defects on Noven&#146;s
ability to estimate its reserves for sales returns and other associated accounting consequences;
risks related to Noven&#146;s dependence on Novartis to perform Novogyne&#146;s financial, accounting,
inventory, distribution, revenues and sales deductions functions (including return reserves and any
asset impairment decisions for Novogyne), including the risk that Novartis may perform these
functions differently than Noven would have, inadequately or incorrectly; the possibility that
Noven&#146;s financial results could fluctuate from period to period or otherwise be affected by
Novartis&#146; monitoring of trade inventory levels for Novogyne and its decisions related thereto; the
risk that the products under development with P&#038;G Pharmaceuticals may not be successfully
developed, approved by the FDA or commercialized; the risk of losses from product liability claims
resulting from the use of HT products such as the lawsuits presently pending against Noven and
Novartis with respect to Noven&#146;s products, as well as any indemnification or contribution
obligations that Noven may have to Novartis or Novogyne related to product liability claims; the
risk that the actual amount incurred by Noven in connection with the current IRS audit (as
previously disclosed in Noven&#146;s </I><I>Form 10-Q</I><I> for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004) exceeds the
amount that Noven has accrued; risks and uncertainties relating to changes in our business
relationships/collaborations; and risks and uncertainties arising from changes in the economy or
the health care sector generally. Noven cautions that the foregoing list is not exhaustive. In
addition to the risks and factors identified above, reference is made to the risks and factors
detailed in Noven&#146;s Annual Report on </I><I>Form 10-K</I><I> as well as other reports filed by Noven with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</I></FONT>
