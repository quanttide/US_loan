Agreement.&nbsp; The Borrower authorizes Guarantor to file, in jurisdictions where this authorization will be given effect, financing statements describing the Collateral in the same manner as it is described herein.&nbsp; From time to time at the request of
Guarantor, the Borrower will execute one or more financing statements and such other documents (and pay the cost of filing the same in all public offices deemed necessary or desirable by Guarantor) and do such other acts and things, all as Guarantor may request, to
establish and maintain a valid security interest in the Collateral (free of all other liens and claims whatsoever) to secure the payment or other performance required with respect to the Collateral and causing notations thereon of the security interest
hereunder.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="CG Times"></font></p>

registration of the securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") might, unless accomplished by one or more of the methods described in subsections (a), (b) or (c) below, constitute either the Guarantors or the Borrower as an "underwriter" as that term is
