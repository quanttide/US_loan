                     TICC ANNOUNCES TERMS OF RIGHTS OFFERING


GREENWICH, CT - 12/20/2004 - Technology Investment Capital Corp. (the "Company")
(NASDAQ: TICC) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the
terms of a transferable rights offering of additional common stock of the
Company (the "Offer"). The Offer will be made only by means of a prospectus.

The Company will issue to shareholders of record as of December 29, 2004 (the
"Record Date"), one transferable right for each share of common stock held. In
order to be a Record Date shareholder, investors must purchase shares of the
Company by no later than December 23, 2004. The rights will entitle holders to
subscribe for additional shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted
price. Holders will be able to purchase one share of common stock for every
three rights held on the Record Date. Record Date shareholders who receive less
than three rights will be entitled to purchase one share. The rights are
transferable and are expected to be admitted for trading on the Nasdaq National
Market under the symbol "TICCR," and to begin trading on December 27, 2004 on a
when issued basis.

     Important Dates:

           Rights Begin Trading:                 December 27, 2004
           Ex-Rights Date:                       December 27, 2004
           Record Date:                          December 29, 2004
           Expiration Date (unless extended):    January 25, 2005

The subscription price will not be determined until the expiration of the Offer
at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on January 25, 2005 (the "Expiration Date"),
unless extended. The subscription price (the "Subscription Price") will be
calculated as 97.5% of the volume-weighted average of the sale prices of the
Company's shares of common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the Expiration
Date.

Record Date shareholders who exercise all rights issued to them will be entitled
to subscribe for additional shares at the Subscription price pursuant to an
over-subscription privilege. If sufficient shares are not available to honor all
over-subscription requests, available shares will be allocated pro rata among
those eligible Record Date shareholders who over-subscribe based on the number
of rights issued to them by the Company on the Record Date.

UBS Securities LLC has been selected by the Company to act as Dealer Manager for
the Offer.
