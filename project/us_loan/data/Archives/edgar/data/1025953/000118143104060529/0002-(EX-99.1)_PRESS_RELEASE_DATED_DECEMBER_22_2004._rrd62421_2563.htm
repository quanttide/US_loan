<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">KANSAS CITY, MO., December 22, 2004</B> -- NovaStar Financial, Inc. (NYSE: NFI), a residential mortgage lender and portfolio investor, announced the fourth quarter, 2004 common dividend and a special common dividend related to 2004 taxable income.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At its recent meeting, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.40 per common share and a special dividend of $1.25 per common share payable on January 14, 2005, to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2004.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We believe our business will support the current quarterly payout of $1.40 in 2005,&quot; said Greg Metz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  &quot;However, from time to time, we may pay special common dividends in order to maintain our status as a Real Estate Investment Trust,&quot; Metz added.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NovaStar will include 2005 dividend guidance in its fourth quarter 2004 earnings release.  Both the earnings release and conference call will take place on February 8, 2005.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, NovaStar revised its calendar 2004 GAAP income guidance downward to a range of $4.10 to $4.40 per share, assuming a steady interest rate environment through the remainder of December.  &quot;As we indicated in our third quarter earnings release, our previously issued guidance of $4.50 to $5.00 per share was predicated on realization of the forward interest rate curve. Due to an upward shift in the short end of the forward curve, we recognized a lower gain related to our latest securitization and also anticipate an impairment on certain of the newer securities in our portfolio. Although some of our securities should reflect gains due to the current economic environment, largely offsetting those experiencing a loss, GAAP accounting rules will not allow the increase in value of these securities to be recognized through the income statement.  The gains associated with the aforementioned securities will flow through the other comprehensive income section of our balance sheet,&quot;
 said Metz.</P>
