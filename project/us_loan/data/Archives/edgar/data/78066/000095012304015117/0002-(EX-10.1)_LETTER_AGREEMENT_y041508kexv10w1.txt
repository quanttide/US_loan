Phelps Dodge Corporation (PD)


      As you know, Southern Peru Copper Corporation, hereinafter referred to as
SPCC, has been discussing the possibility of entering into a strategic
transaction (the "Transaction") involving Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ("MM").
The Transaction involves MM becoming a subsidiary of SPCC in consideration for
the issuance of Common Stock by SPCC to Americas Mining Corporation ("AMC") for
its approximately 99% MM ownership. The Transaction would involve the
solicitation of votes of the shareholders of SPCC in order to approve the
issuance of Common Stock in connection with the acquisition by SPCC of MM. We
would like to obtain the expression of your current intent to vote to approve
this Transaction in accordance with the paragraphs below.

      We are convinced that the Transaction would transform SPCC into one of the
world's premier mining companies, with superior scale and market position,
high-quality asset portfolio, geographic and country diversification, commodity
and semi-manufactured product diversification, great synergies, sizable combined
sales and EBITDA to compete internationally, and one class of shares to improve
liquidity and access to the capital markets.

Proposed Liquidity and Support Provisions

      AMC is willing to use its reasonable best efforts to cause SPCC to provide
registration rights to Phelps Dodge Corporation, hereinafter referred to as PD,
in accordance with a Registration Rights Agreement that will include the terms
set forth in Annex A to this letter and will otherwise contain terms customary
for registration rights agreements. AMC will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause SPCC to, and PD will, in good faith as soon as possible after the
execution of this letter, negotiate, complete, execute and deliver such a
Registration Rights Agreement.

      In connection with such Registration Rights Agreement and after the
conversion of shares of Class A Common Stock in SPCC held by PD into shares of
Common Stock, PD agrees not to sell its shares of SPCC during the period
beginning on the closing of the Transaction until the end of the Initial Six
Month Period (as defined in Annex A hereto) but in no event to exceed eight
months from the closing of the Transaction, if any, other than through a
secondary offering effected pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement;
provided, however, that PD shall be permitted to dividend or otherwise transfer
all or any portion of its shares of SPCC to PD's parent corporation, and PD and
its parent corporation shall each be permitted to dividend or otherwise transfer
all or any portion of such shares to the parent corporation's trust shareholders
and/or beneficiaries of such trusts; and provided, further, that such parent
corporation, trust shareholders and/or beneficiaries, as the case may be, shall
first execute one or more counterparts to this letter agreeing to be bound by
its terms.
<PAGE>
     During the period described in the prior paragraph, PD agrees that the
maximum number of shares of SPCC that it will sell will be subject to the
volume limitations set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

      AMC agrees not to sell and will use its best efforts to prevent its
affiliates shares of SPCC from selling during the during the period beginning on
the closing of the Transaction until the end of the Initial Six Month Period (as
defined in Annex A hereto) but in no event to exceed eight months from the
closing of the Transaction. AMC further agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause SPCC to not conduct a primary offering of its shares during the
first six months following the closing of the Transaction, subject to the
Company's right to issue shares in connection with acquisitions, mergers,
business combinations, applicable benefit plans and other similar transactions.

      Other than pursuant to an offering effected in accordance with the
Registration Rights Agreement, PD will not, following the closing of the
Transaction, knowingly sell PD's shares in SPCC to any strategic buyers or
competitors of the Company without AMC's prior approval, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

      Taking into account that the Special Committee of disinterested Directors
of SPCC did recommend to the Board of Directors of SPCC the approval of the
Transaction and the Board consequently voted in favor of it, we kindly propose
that PD, together with AMC, express their current intent, and PD and AMC do
hereby express their current intent, to (i) submit their proxies to vote in
favor of the Transaction and for such actions as are required to consummate the
Transaction in accordance with the Special Committee's recommendation and (ii)
take all action reasonably necessary to effect simultaneously with the closing
of the Transaction the conversion of their Class A Common Stock into a single
class of Common Stock with the rights and privileges as set forth in SPCC's
Certificate of Incorporation as it currently exists, which would provide greater
liquidity for all investors.

      This letter will be governed by the laws of the State of New York
applicable to contracts to be performed wholly within such state.

                                    disruption in the market for shares of

                                    offering pursuant to a demand registration,
                                    including the following: SPCC will use its
                                    reasonable best efforts to arrange, organize

                                    manner comparable to similar presentations

                                    involved.

                                    offerings of similar size and complexity. PD
                                    will enter into such an underwriting
                                    agreement at the request of SPCC. All
                                    representations, warranties and other
                                    agreements on the part of SPCC to and for

                                    not be required to make any representations,
                                    warranties or agreements other than those
                                    regarding PD, its Registrable Securities,

                                    any prospectus supplement.

                                    attributable to the registration of its
                                    Registrable Securities, including
                                    registration and filing fees, fees and

                                    expenses are reasonable and customary. In
                                    addition, PD will be responsible for its own
                                    underwriting discounts and commissions and
                                    transfer taxes attributable to its sales.
                                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, SPCC will be
                                    responsible for, and PD will not bear, any
                                    internal expenses of SPCC, including
                                    overhead and salaries and expenses of its
                                    officers and employees.

Assignability                       The registration rights granted to PD will
                                    be assignable to the indirect trust
                                    shareholders of PD and/or beneficiaries of
                                    such trusts and to transferees of greater
                                    than 50% of the original number of PD's
                                    Registrable Shares.

Third Party Registration Rights     If SPCC grants registration rights to other
                                    Third Party, such rights will be on the same
                                    terms and conditions as the rights granted
                                    to PD under the Registration Rights
                                    Agreement.

                                    In all events, SPCC will not provide
                                    registration rights to any holder or
                                    prospective holder of SPCC shares that are
                                    more favorable, in terms of timing or
                                    otherwise, than the rights conferred upon PD
                                    under the Registration Rights Agreement
                                    unless PD is also provided with the
                                    opportunity to receive such more favorable
                                    rights.
