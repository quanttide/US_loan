            Torch Offshore Announces Appointment of
                  Chief Restructuring Advisor

New Orleans, Louisiana USA, December 21, 2004

Torch   Offshore,   Inc.  (NASDAQ:  TORC)  (the   "Company")
announced  today that its Board of Directors  has  appointed
David  Phelps  of Bridge Associates LLC, a nationally  known
turnaround and crisis management consulting firm,  as  Chief
Restructuring Advisor of the Company. The Company engaged  a
Chief  Restructuring  Advisor  as  part  of  its  previously
announced   strategy  to  overcome  its  current   liquidity
situation. As Chief Restructuring Advisor, Mr. Phelps' tasks
will include working with the Company's senior management to
monitor  and improve the Company's liquidity; reviewing  and
assisting  in  the  negotiation of all  material  contracts;
reviewing  the  financial  aspects  of  all  operations  and
working directly with the Company's other advisors to review
and  negotiate any proposed financial transactions. Lyle  G.
Stockstill,  the  Company's  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive
Officer,  will  continue  to be responsible  for  the  daily
operational activities of the Company.

Established  in  1978, Torch Offshore, Inc. is  involved  in
offshore  pipeline installation and subsea construction  for
the  oil  and natural gas industry. Torch Offshore, Inc.  is
expanding beyond its established shallow water niche  market
in  order to serve the industry's worldwide growing needs in
the deep waters.

Any  statements made in this news release, other than  those
of  historical fact, about an action, event or  development,
which  the  Company hopes, expects, believes or  anticipates
may  or  will  occur  in  the  future,  are  forward-looking
statements  under the Private Securities Litigation  Act  of
1995.  The  forward-looking statements in this news  release
include   statements   about  the   roles   of   the   Chief
Restructuring  Advisor and the Chairman and Chief  Executive
Officer. Such statements are subject to various assumptions,
risks and uncertainties, which are specifically described in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended  December  31,  2003  filed with  the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission, as well as other factors that  may  not
be  within  the  Company's control, including, specifically,
oil and natural gas commodity prices, weather conditions and
offshore construction activity levels. Although the  Company
believes   its   expectations  are   based   on   reasonable
assumptions,  it  gives  no  assurance  that  the  Company's
assumptions and projections will prove to be correct. Actual
results may differ materially from those projected.
