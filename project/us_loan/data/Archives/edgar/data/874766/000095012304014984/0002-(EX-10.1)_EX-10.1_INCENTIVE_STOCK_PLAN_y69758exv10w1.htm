<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1. Purpose</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Plan is to motivate and reward superior
performance on the part of Key Employees of The Hartford and to thereby
attract and retain Key Employees of superior ability. In addition, the
Plan is intended to further opportunities for stock ownership by such Key
Employees and Directors in order to increase their proprietary interest
in The Hartford and, as a result, their interest in the success of the
Company. Awards will be made, in the discretion of the Committee, to Key
Employees (including officers and directors who are also Key Employees)
whose responsibilities and decisions directly affect the performance of
any Participating Company and its subsidiaries, and also to Directors.
Such incentive awards may consist of stock options and stock appreciation
rights payable in stock or cash for Key Employees or Directors, and
performance shares, restricted stock, restricted units or any combination
of the foregoing for Key Employees, as the Committee may determine.

based on comparative performance of any one or more of the following
relative to other entities: (A)&nbsp;earnings per share, (B)&nbsp;return on equity,
(C)&nbsp;cash flow, (D)&nbsp;return on total capital, (E)&nbsp;return on assets, (F)

Participating Company before January&nbsp;1, 2002, because of his or her
voluntary termination of employment due to Retirement, or (iv)&nbsp;under

a waiver would be in the best interests of the Company; that Key Employee

Employee terminates service with all Participating Companies during a
Performance Period or any applicable Restriction Period for any other
reason, then such Key Employee shall not be entitled to any Award with
respect to that Performance Period and/or Restriction Period unless the
Committee shall otherwise determine.

foregoing, the Committee may require or permit the deferral of payment in
respect of Restricted Units to a date or dates (including, without
limitation, the date the Key Employee&#146;s employment or a Director&#146;s

Employee shall be paid, immediately following the occurrence of such

file with the Company a written designation of one or more persons as the

Transferee may from time to time revoke or change his or her Beneficiary
designation without the consent of any prior Beneficiary by filing a new
designation with the Company. The last such designation received by the
Company shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or
change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the
Company prior to the Key Employee&#146;s, Director&#146;s or Transferee&#146;s death, as
the case may be, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior
to such receipt.

death of a Key Employee, Director or Transferee, as the case may be, or
if no designated Beneficiary survives the Key Employee, Director or
Transferee or if such designation conflicts with applicable law, the
estate of the Key Employee, Director or Transferee, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to receive the Award, if any, payable under the Plan
upon his or her death. If the Committee is in doubt as to the right of
any person to receive such Award, the Company may retain such Award,
without liability for any interest thereon, until the Committee
determines the rights thereto, or the Company may pay such Award into any
court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete
discharge of the liability of the Company therefor.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board or the Committee may, at any time, amend or modify the
Plan and, specifically, may make such modifications to the Plan as it
deems necessary to avoid the application of Section 162(m) of the Code

respect only to Incentive Stock Options, no amendment shall, without
approval by a majority of the Company&#146;s stockholders, (A)&nbsp;alter the group
of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, or (B)&nbsp;except as provided
in Section&nbsp;13 increase the maximum number of shares of Stock which are
available for Awards under the Plan; or, (ii)&nbsp;with respect to all
Options, allow the Committee to reprice the Options. The Board may
suspend or terminate the Plan at any time without the consent of such
person. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Plan
shall not be amended, modified, suspended or terminated during the period
in which a Change of Control is threatened. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, a Change of Control shall be deemed to be threatened
for the period beginning on the date of any Potential Change of Control,

such Potential Change of Control, (II)&nbsp;the date a Change of Control

employment at any time. No Award payable under the Plan shall be deemed
salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any
employee benefit plan or other arrangement of any Participating Company
for the benefit of its employees unless the Company shall determine
otherwise. No Key Employee shall have any claim to an Award until it is
actually granted under the Plan. To the extent that any person acquires a
right to receive payments from the Company under this Plan, such right
shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of
the Company. All payments to
be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and
no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of
assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as provided
in Section 7(e) with respect to Restricted Stock.

deemed appropriate in its sole discretion to satisfy any obligation of
the Company to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes
incurred by reason of the operation of the Plan or an Award under the
Plan, including but not limited to at any time: (i)&nbsp;requiring a Key
Employee to submit payment to the Company for such taxes before making
settlement of any Award of Stock or other amount due under the Plan, (ii)
withholding such taxes from wages or other amounts due to the Key
Employee before making settlement of any Award of Stock or other amount

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Key Employee<BR>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">I am pleased to inform you that
effective &#091;DATE&#093;, the Compensation and
Personnel Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of The Hartford
Financial Services Group, Inc. (&#147;The Hartford&#148;) approved an award on your
behalf under The Hartford&#146;s Long-term Incentive Compensation Program. Your
award is comprised of &#091;three&#093; parts: &#091;a stock option,&#093; &#091;performance shares and&#093;
&#091;restricted stock units&#093;.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">You have been granted a non-qualified
option to purchase all or any portion of
<B>x,xxx </B>shares of common stock of The Hartford under the terms of The Hartford
Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) at an exercise price of $&#091;XXX&#093; per share,
being the New York Stock Exchange closing price of The Hartford&#146;s common stock
on &#091;DATE&#093; (the date of grant of the option). This option will become
exercisable &#091;at the later of (i) three years from the grant date
or (ii) when the closing price of The Hartford's common stock reaches
125% of the grant price for ten consecutive trading days&#093;.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">You have also been
granted <B>xxxxxx </B>&#091;operating division&#093; performance shares of
The Hartford&#146;s common stock. This is a contingent award, and the extent to
which you may ultimately receive all or any of these performance shares depends
upon whether and to what extent the following two performance objectives are
achieved over the &#091;three-year&#093; performance period, &#091;DATE &#150; DATE&#093;:
The Hartford&#146;s
operating income and The Hartford&#146;s return on equity relative to targets
established by the Committee.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">You have also been granted <B>xxxxxx </B>restricted stock units of The Hartford. Each
restricted stock unit represents a contractual right to receive, pursuant to
the terms of The Hartford&#146;s Incentive Stock Plan, one share of common stock of
The Hartford per restricted stock unit at the end of the
&#091;three-year&#093; period from &#091;DATE&#093; to
&#091;DATE&#093; (the &#147;Service Period&#148;). This is a contingent award, and remains subject
to forfeiture pending completion of the Service Period.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The estimated value of your
long-term award (&#091;the option&#093;, &#091;the performance
shares&#093;
&#091;and the restricted stock units&#093;) as of the date of grant was <B>$XXXX</B>.
Ultimately, the value of the award will depend on the stock price at the time
of option exercise &#091;or at the end of the Service Period in the
case of restricted stock units&#093;, whether and to what extent the performance share objectives
are achieved, and other factors.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Enclosed is information
related to performance shares and restricted stock units. More information on
option awards can be obtained from The Hartford&#146;s Intranet Directory as

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Effective &#091;<B>DATE&#093;</B>, in conjunction with your service on the Board of Directors of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (&#147;The Hartford&#148;), you have been
granted a non-qualified stock option.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This option provides the ability for you to purchase all or any portion of
<B>x,xxx </B>shares of common stock of The Hartford under the terms of The Hartford
Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) at an exercise price of <B>$xx.xx </B>per share,
being the New York Stock Exchange closing price of The Hartford&#146;s common stock
on &#091;<B>DATE&#093; </B>(the date of the grant of the option). Your option will vest
provided you actively and continuously serve as a director of The Hartford
until vesting occurs (unless otherwise provided by the Plan). The vesting
schedule that applies to your option is as follows: one-third of the option
will become exercisable one year after the date of grant, an additional
one-third of the option will become exercisable two years after the date of
grant, and the option will become exercisable in full three years after the
date of grant. (Your options may vest earlier before the end of the vesting
period in certain circumstances described in the Plan.) However, any
unexercised portion expires in full on &#091;<B>DATE&#093;</B>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Please note that this notice, the Plan, and the administrative rules of the
Compensation and Personnel Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of
Directors of The Hartford with respect to the Non-Employee Directors&#146; Option
Program (a copy of which is attached hereto) constitute your option agreement
with The Hartford. Although you are not required to sign any formal documents,
your option grant is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, as
it may be amended from time to time, and all of the rules, procedures and
interpretations of the Plan that the Committee may adopt from time to time.
Specifically, please refer to the Plan and the administrative rules for
information on what happens to your option should your service as a director of
The Hartford terminate. Enclosed are a Plan prospectus (Attachment A) that
includes a copy of the Plan and related information, a copy of the
administrative rules for the Plan (Attachment B) and a form for you to
designate a beneficiary for your option (Attachment C). Should you wish to
designate a beneficiary for your option, the Beneficiary Designation Form must
be returned to me at The Hartford, Hartford Plaza, HO-1-01, Hartford, CT 06115,
Fax (860)&nbsp;547-4562. If the form is not returned to me, your option
transferable to a designated beneficiary will be transferred to your estate in
the event of your death, except to the extent that you previously filed a
Beneficiary Designation Form applicable to future awards under the Plan.
Unless revoked, your Beneficiary Designation Form will apply to all options
previously granted under the Plan and any options that may be awarded to you in
the future under the Plan. You will receive information about exercising your
option from the Plan&#146;s stock option administrator. These exercise procedures
must be followed, and may change from time to time.
