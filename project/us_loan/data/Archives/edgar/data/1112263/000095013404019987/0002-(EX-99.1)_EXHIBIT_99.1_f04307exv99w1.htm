<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Proxim Corporation Updates Fourth Quarter 2004 Financial Guidance</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SUNNYVALE, Calif., Dec. 29 &#151; Proxim Corporation (Nasdaq: PROX &#151; News), a global leader in
wireless networking equipment for Wi-Fi and wide area networks, today updated its financial
guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004. Proxim now expects fourth quarter 2004 revenue will
be in the range of $22&nbsp;million to $24&nbsp;million, compared to the $32&nbsp;million to $35&nbsp;million target
previously provided in October&nbsp;2004. Based on revenue in this range, Proxim expects to report a
non-GAAP or operating pro-forma loss per share in the range of ($.34) to ($.29) for the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2004, which compares to the target range previously provided for the quarter of
($.14) to ($.09). At this time, Proxim is unable to provide guidance on its projected GAAP loss per
share results.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Factors contributing to the revised financial guidance for the fourth quarter revenue include the
following:

results is forward-looking and preliminary. Final, actual results might vary, depending upon

quarter, completion of quarter-end close procedures and review by Proxim&#146;s independent accountants.
More information on Proxim&#146;s fiscal fourth quarter performance, including its GAAP results, will be
communicated during Proxim&#146;s regularly scheduled quarterly earnings call. The Company expects to
announce its final results for the first quarter after the market close on January&nbsp;27, 2005.
Details regarding the January&nbsp;27, 2005 conference call will be provided in a separate press
release.

operating expenses and charges and any adjustments resulting from review of the Company&#146;s
independent accountants and the audit committee; Proxim&#146;s efforts to address transitions of product
platforms not succeeding; the market for Proxim&#146;s products; and not growing as anticipated or
Proxim not taking advantage of market opportunities due to competition, product performance,
product pricing, product supply or other issues and other risks and uncertainties associated with
Proxim&#146;s business. For additional information regarding risks relating to Proxim&#146;s business, see
Proxim Corporation&#146;s Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and Forms 10-Q for quarters
ended April&nbsp;2, 2004, July&nbsp;2, 2004 and October&nbsp;1, 2004. Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other
relevant materials filed by Proxim with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Proxim assumes no
obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Use of Pro Forma Financial Information



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Proxim uses
non-GAAP, or pro forma, measures of operating results, net income/loss and income/loss per share,
which are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses that we believe are useful
to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These adjustments to our GAAP
results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a supplemental
understanding of Proxim&#146;s underlying operational results and trends. Adjusted pro forma results are
among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting our business.
The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for Proxim&#146;s financial results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. At this time, Proxim is unable to provide preliminary GAAP loss
per share results or a reconciliation of preliminary pro forma to GAAP loss per share results for
the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to the Company&#146;s need to complete a valuation of the
induced conversion charge related to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock during the
fourth quarter of 2004 and the determination of certain other related charges.
