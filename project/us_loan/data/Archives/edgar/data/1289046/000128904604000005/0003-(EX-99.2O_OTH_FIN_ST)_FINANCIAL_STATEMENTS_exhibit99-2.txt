         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
         -------------------------------------------------------

We  have  audited  the  accompanying balance sheets of APD Antiquities, Inc. (a
Nevada  corporation)  as of  December  31,  2003  and  2002,  and  the  related
statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity  and  cash flows for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility  of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is  to express an opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with  the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those  standards  require  that  we
plan  and  perform  the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free  of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in
the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes assessing the accounting
principles  used  and significant estimates made  by  management,  as  well  as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred  to  above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of APD Antiquities,  Inc.  as  of
December  31,  2003  and 2002, and the results of its operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows  for  the  years then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements  have  been prepared assuming the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed  in  Note  2,  the Company has a
history of operating losses, has limited cash resources, and its  viability  is
dependent  upon  its ability to meet its future financing requirements, and the
success of future  operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as  a going concern. Management's plans regarding
those matters also are described in  Note  2.  The  financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

APD ANTIQUITIES, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1- ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

APD Antiquities, Inc. (hereinafter "the Company") was  incorporated on July 23,
1996 under the laws of the State of Nevada for the purpose  of the sale of rare
antiques. The Company maintains its corporate office in Spokane, Washington and
offers its products online. The Company's fiscal year end is December 31.

The Company changed its name from APD International Corporation in August of
1999. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company  is presented to
assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements  and
notes are representations of the Company's management, which is responsible for
their   integrity   and  objectivity.  These  accounting  policies  conform  to
accounting principles  generally  accepted  in the United States of America and
have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.

Going Concern
- -------------

The  accompanying financial statements have been  prepared  assuming  that  the
Company  will  continue  as a going concern. At September 30, 2004, the Company
had a history of operating  losses,  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $44,020  and
limited  cash  resources.  These  conditions  raise significant doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The future of the Company is
dependent  upon  its  ability  to obtain financing and upon  future  profitable
operations. Management's plans are  to seek additional capital through sales of
its inventory and, if necessary, the  possible  sale  of  the  Company's stock.
However, management has no plans to make a private offering of common  stock at
this time.

The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating to the
recoverability  and  classification  of  recorded  assets,  or the amounts  and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the  event the Company
cannot continue in existence.

Accounting Method
- -----------------

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of
accounting.

Accounting Pronouncements
- -------------------------

In  May  2003,  the  Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement  of
Financial  Accounting Standards No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Financial
Instruments  with  Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (hereinafter
"SFAS  No. 150"). SFAS  No.  150  establishes  standards  for  classifying  and
measuring   certain   financial   instruments   with  characteristics  of  both
liabilities  and equity and requires that those instruments  be  classified  as
liabilities in  statements  of  financial  position.  Previously, many of those
instruments were classified as equity. SFAS No. 150 is  effective for financial
instruments  entered  into  or  modified  after May 31, 2003 and  otherwise  is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period

Accounting Pronouncements (continued)
- -------------------------------------

beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company has determined that it has no
financial instruments that would be affected by this pronouncement.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (hereinafter "SFAS No. 149").
SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities". This statement is effective for contracts entered into
or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 is not expected to have a material
impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

In  June 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit  or Disposal Activities"  (hereinafter  "SFAS  No.  146").  SFAS  No.  146
addresses  significant  issues  regarding  the  recognition,  measurement,  and
reporting  of  costs  associated  with  exit and disposal activities, including
restructuring activities. SFAS No. 146 also  addresses  recognition  of certain
costs  related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease, costs  to
consolidate facilities or relocate employees, and termination benefits provided
to employees  that  are  involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one-time

benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual
deferred-compensation contract.  SFAS  No.  146  was issued in June 2003 and is
effective for activities after December 31, 2003.  There  has been no impact on
the  Company's financial position or results of operations from  adopting  SFAS
No. 146.

In April  2003,  the  Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.  145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 44,
4  and  64, Amendment of FASB Statement  No.  13,  and  Technical  Corrections"
(hereinafter  "SFAS No. 145"), which updates, clarifies and simplifies existing
accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 4, which required all gains and losses from
the extinguishment  of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an
extraordinary item, net  of related tax effect was rescinded. As a result, SFAS
No. 64, which amended SFAS No. 4, was rescinded, as it was no longer necessary.
SFAS No. 44, Accounting for  intangible  Assets  of Motor Carriers, established
the accounting requirements for the effects of transition  to the provisions of
the  Motor Carrier Act of 1980. Since the transition has been  completed,  SFAS
No. 44 is no longer necessary and has been rescinded. SFAS No. 145 amended SFAS
No. 13  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-
leaseback   transactions   and   the  required  accounting  for  certain  lease
modifications that have economic effects  that  are  similar  to sale-leaseback
transactions.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 which did not have  a  material
effect on the financial statements of the Company.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Accounting Pronouncements (continued)
- -------------------------------------

In December 2002,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting   Standards   No.   148,   "Accounting   for  Stock-Based
Compensation  - Transition and Disclosure" (hereinafter "SFAS No.  148").  SFAS
No. 148 amends  SFAS  No.  123,  "Accounting  for Stock-Based Compensation," to
provide alternative methods of transition for a  voluntary  change  to the fair
value  based  method  of  accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In
addition, the statement amends  the  disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to
require prominent disclosure in both annual  and  interim  financial statements
about  the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation  and  the
effect of  the method used on reported results. The provisions of the statement
are effective  for  financial statements for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The Company  will report stock issued to employees under the rules of
SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, there is no change is disclosure requirements due to
SFAS No. 148.

Advertising Costs
- -----------------

Advertising costs, including  costs  for  direct  mailings,  are  expensed when
incurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 these costs
were $359 and $435, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, these costs were $554 and $536, respectively.

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
- ------------------------------------

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number
of  common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is the  same
as basic  net  income (loss) per share as there are no common stock equivalents
outstanding.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly
liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Compensated Absences
- --------------------

The Company does not offer paid vacation or personal time to its employees.
Accordingly, there is no related accrual of expenses.

Derivative Instruments
- ----------------------

The  Financial  Accounting   Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS")  No.  133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB No.
133",  and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for  Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and
Certain  Hedging  Activities", which is effective for the Company as of January
1, 2001. These standards  establish  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for
derivative  instruments,  including  certain derivative instruments embedded in

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Derivative Instruments (continued)
- ---------------------------------

other   contracts,  and for hedging activities.  They  require  that an  entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the  balance sheet
and measure those instruments at fair value.

If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a
hedge,  the  objective  of  which  is to match  the  timing  of  gain  or  loss
recognition on the hedging derivative  with  the recognition of (i) the changes
in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the
hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the  hedged  forecasted transaction.
For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument,  the  gain  or loss is
recognized in income in the period of change.

Historically, the Company has not entered into derivative contracts to hedge
existing risks or for speculative purposes.

As of September 30, 2004, the Company has not engaged in any transactions that
would be considered derivative instruments or hedging activities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- -----------------------------------

The carrying amounts for cash, payables and accrued liabilities approximate
their fair value.

Interim Financial Statements
- ----------------------------

The  financial  statements  for  the  period ended September 30, 2004, included
herein, are interim financial statements.  They  reflect all adjustments, which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present  fairly  the results of
operations   for   the  period.  All  such  adjustments  are  normal  recurring
adjustments. The results  of operations for the interim period presented is not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.

Inventories
- -----------

Inventories are accounted for  using  the  specific  identification method, and
stated at the lower of cost or market, with market representing  the  lower  of
replacement  cost  or  estimated  net  realizable  value.  The  Company  has no
insurance coverage on its inventory.

The  Company  has  no  inventory  on  consignment  at  September 30, 2004 or at
December 31, 2003. In the future, if the Company consigns  inventory,  it  will
retain  title  and  will  insure  the  inventory  until  the inventory is sold,
returned, lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed.

The change in inventory balance from December 31, 2003 to September 30, 2004
was principally the result of the sale of an antique table with a recorded cost
of $17,500.

Provision for Taxes
- -------------------

Income  taxes  are  provided  based  upon  the liability method  of  accounting
pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards  No.  109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes." Under this approach, deferred income taxes are  recorded  to
reflect  the  tax  consequences  in future years of differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at

each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if
management does not believe the Company  has  met  the  "more  likely than not"
standard imposed by SFAS No. 109 to allow recognition of such an asset.

At September 30, 2004, the Company had net deferred tax assets of approximately
$14,900  principally arising from net operating loss carryforwards  for  income
tax purposes  calculated  at  an  expected  rate  of  34%. As management of the
Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not  that the Company will
realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset, a valuation  allowance equal
to  the  deferred tax asset was present at December 31, 2003 and September  30,
2.004. The  significant  components  of the deferred tax asset at September 30,
2004 and December 31, 2003 were as follows:



                                            September 30,   December 31,

At September 30, 2004, the Company has net operating   loss   carryforwards  of
approximately $44,000, which expire in the years 2020 through 2024.  The change
in  the allowance account from December 31, 2003 to September 30, 2004  was  an
increase of $700.

Revenue and Cost Recognition
- ----------------------------

Revenues from retail sales are recognized at the time the products are
delivered.

Although the Company does not provide a written warranty on its items sold, the
Company  will refund the purchase price paid to any customer in those instances
when an item  sold  is  proven to be non-authentic. In a majority of instances,
the  Company  receives a certificate  of  authenticity  for  documents  (items)
purchased from  its  vendors  and is reasonably assured as to the provenance of
its products. Since inception,  the Company has made no refunds for the sale of
any non-authentic items nor has the  Company  received  any claims or notice of
prospective  claims relating to such items. Accordingly, the  Company  has  not
established a reserve against forgery or non-authenticity.

If a product proves not to be authentic, the Company would give a full refund
to the purchaser and record a charge for sales returns.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Use of Estimates
- ----------------

The process of  preparing  financial  statements  in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States  of America requires the use
of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types  of  assets,  liabilities,
revenues,   and   expenses.   Such  estimates  primarily  relate  to  unsettled
transactions  and  events  as  of  the   date   of  the  financial  statements.
Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.
At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company had not participated in consignment
or conditional sales; therefore, there are no unsettled transactions related to
sales or cost of sales.


NOTE 3 - NOTES PAYABLE

During the year ended December 31, 2003, an outside  party  loaned  the Company
$1,200.  The unsecured loan bore no interest and was due on November 20,  2004.

full.

During the  year  ended  December 31, 1999, 300,000 shares of common stock were
issued to officers and directors  for  cash  in the amount of $300 (par value),
51,000 common shares were sold for $1.00 per share and 1,000 common shares were
issued  for  converted  debt.  Stock subscriptions  receivable  of  $16,000  at
December 31, 1999 were collected in the year ended December 31, 2000.

In September 2004, the Company issued 10,000 shares of common stock for cash in
the amount of $10,000.


NOTE 5 - STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Company's board of directors  approved  the  adoption  of  the  "2001  Non-
Qualified Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan" by unanimous consent
on  January 15, 2001. This plan was initiated to encourage and enable officers,
directors,  consultants,  advisors  and  other  key employees of the Company to
acquire and retain a proprietary interest in the  Company  by  ownership of its
common  stock.  A total of 1,000,000 of the authorized shares of the Company's
