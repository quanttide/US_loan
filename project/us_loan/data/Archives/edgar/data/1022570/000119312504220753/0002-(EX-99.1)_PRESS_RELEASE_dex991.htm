operations requirements for the Rule. Since then, the Company&#146;s market value of listed securities has been $35 million or greater for 10 consecutive trading days. Accordingly, the Nasdaq notice to the Company stated that the Company has
regained compliance with the Rule, and the matter is now closed. The continued listing of the Company&#146;s common stock on Nasdaq will depend on the Company&#146;s continued compliance with all of Nasdaq&#146;s listing requirements. </FONT></P> <P
