<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EAGLEPICHER HOLDINGS, INC. AND EAGLEPICHER INCORPORATED<BR>
ANNOUNCE REVISED EARNINGS GUIDANCE<BR>
FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR 2004 AND MARGINAL COMPLIANCE WITH<BR>
CERTAIN DEBT COVENANTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>PHOENIX, Arizona, December&nbsp;27, 2004 &#151; </B>EaglePicher Holdings, Inc. and EaglePicher Incorporated
(collectively &#147;EaglePicher&#148;) announce that they are revising downward their earnings guidance for
fiscal year 2004. EaglePicher expects to report revenues for the year ending November&nbsp;30, 2004
consistent with its prior guidance of $705 to $712&nbsp;million, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) of
$70 to $77&nbsp;million, down from its prior guidance of $82 to $86&nbsp;million, and Credit Agreement EBITDA
(as defined below) of $80 to $87&nbsp;million, down from its prior guidance of $90 to $94&nbsp;million.
EaglePicher&#146;s net debt, including the investment in its accounts receivable program, at fiscal year
end is expected to be $406.3&nbsp;million, within its prior forecast of $400 to $410&nbsp;million, and its
total debt, including the investment in its accounts receivable program, is expected to be $426.3
million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduced forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Agreement EBITDA ranges are primarily due to
reduced margin booking rates for two long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of
completion method in the Defense &#038; Space Power unit of EaglePicher&#146;s Power Group Segment due to
increased foreign exchange rates and reduced productivity performance and assumptions. These items
did not have a significant impact on cash flow in the fourth quarter. The reduced forecasted
ranges are also due to several lot acceptance test failures on battery programs in the Defense &#038;
Space Power unit, an inventory adjustment, additional vacation and severance accruals and other
miscellaneous items, all within the Defense &#038; Space Power unit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Defense Security Service imposes restrictions on EaglePicher headquarters
management&#146;s access to financial and operational details within the Defense

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#038; Space Power unit. For the past several months, management of EaglePicher has been in
negotiation with the U.S. Defense Security Service on obtaining permanent access to the Defense &#038;
Space Power unit. Upon identification of the matters described above, certain members of
management at EaglePicher&#146;s headquarters have been granted immediate temporary access to such
information and are in the process of reviewing such information with the recently appointed Chief
Financial Officer of the Defense &#038; Space Power unit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the high end of the revised Credit Agreement EBITDA range, EaglePicher Incorporated (EPI)
expects to be in compliance with all financial covenants in its credit agreement and accounts
receivable securitization facility as of November&nbsp;30, 2004. At the low end of the revised Credit
Agreement EBITDA range, EPI would not be in compliance with certain financial covenants under its
credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization facility at November&nbsp;30, 2004. If EPI is
not in compliance, it would need to obtain a waiver of or amendment to the applicable agreement.
No assurance can be given that it will be able to obtain such a waiver or amendment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing information is preliminary and unaudited. EaglePicher does not expect that its
final financial results and the determination of whether it was in compliance with all financial
covenants will be available before mid-February.

financial measures&#148; as defined under SEC regulations. Specifically, we refer to Adjusted EBITDA,
Credit Agreement EBITDA and Net Debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
unusual items. Unusual items represent certain significant matters which positively or negatively
impact net earnings that management determines to be not representative of our ongoing operations.
Our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental financial measure to
investors because it is of major interest to our debt holders. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our
management as a factor for reviewing business unit performance. Examples of items that may be
included in unusual items are gains/losses from major asset sales, costs or settlements related to
major restructuring plans, litigation settlement costs, or material damage to our facilities or
operations due to force majeure not covered by our insurance. A reconciliation of our Adjusted
EBITDA to operating income, its most closely related GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Credit Agreement EBITDA is defined in our credit agreement as net income before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization, certain non-cash non-recurring charges (other than routine accruals),
non-cash long term bonus program accruals, non-cash pension income or expense and non-cash gains,
minus the amount of cash disbursements related to certain non-cash charges excluded in a prior
period. For the complete definition of Credit Agreement EBITDA, see our credit agreement dated
August&nbsp;7, 2003 filed as an exhibit to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended August&nbsp;31, 2003. Our management believes that Credit Agreement EBITDA is a useful
supplemental financial measure to investors because it determines compliance with financial
covenants in our credit agreement and receivables program. For fiscal year 2004, Credit Agreement
EBITDA is expected to be approximately $10.0&nbsp;million higher than Adjusted EBITDA, with the primary
differences being the inclusion of $5.1&nbsp;million of net gains on divestitures of discontinued
business units and the exclusion of $4.5&nbsp;million of losses from consolidated joint ventures and
other non-cash items.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Net Debt is defined as debt, both short and long term, on our balance sheet plus the off-balance
sheet obligations of our accounts receivable asset-backed securitization less cash on our balance
sheet. Forecasted net debt reconciliation:
