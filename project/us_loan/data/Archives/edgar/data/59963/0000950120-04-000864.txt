ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS;
          ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS
          --------------------------------------------------------

          Effective as of December 1, 2004, Winfried M. Klimek resigned as a
director of Distinctive Devices, Inc. (the "Registrant") and ceased serving as
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of galaxis technology ag, a German
corporation and the principal subsidiary of the Registrant ("galaxis"). On
December 22, 2004, Dr. Hans Triebess became the interim CEO of galaxis. Dr.
Treibess is a attorney in Germany and has been associated with galaxis matters.

          On December 3, 2004, Mr. Klimek was indicted and arrested by the
German authorities based upon allegations of fraud related to supposed
non-payment or credit arrangements in 1999 and 2000 with certain vendors and
banks of galaxis and predecessor German companies and unrelated companies with
which Mr. Klimek had been associated or controlled. Mr. Klimek has denied the
allegations.
