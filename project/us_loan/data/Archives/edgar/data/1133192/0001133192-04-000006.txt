Item  4.01        Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants

     On August 23, 2004 HJ & Associates,  L.L.C.  ("HJ &  Associates")  resigned
from its position as Viper Network, Inc.'s principal independent accountant.

     The audit reports of HJ & Associates  on Viper  Network,  Inc.'s  financial
statements  for the year ended  December  31,  2000 did not  contain any adverse
opinion or  disclaimer  of opinion or  qualification.  HJ & Associates  did not,
during  the  applicable  periods,  advise  Viper  Networks,  Inc.  of any of the
enumerated items described in Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-B.

     Viper  Networks,  Inc. and HJ & Associates have not, in connection with the
audits  of Viper  Networks,  Inc.'s  financial  statements  for the  year  ended
December 31, 2000 had any disagreement on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreement,  if not  resolved  to HJ &  Associates'  satisfaction,  would have
caused  HJ &  Associates  to  make  reference  to  the  subject  matter  of  the
disagreement in connection with its reports.

     On August 23, 2004, Viper Networks, Inc. retained the firm of J.H. Cohn LLP
to audit Viper Network, Inc.'s financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2001,  December 31, 2002,  and December 31, 2003. At no time during the past
three fiscal years or any subsequent  period did Viper  Networks,  Inc.  consult
with J.H. Cohn LLP regarding either the application of accounting  principles to
a specified  transaction or the type of audit opinion which might be rendered on
Viper Networks,  Inc.'s financial statements or any matter of the sort described
above with reference to HJ & Associates.
