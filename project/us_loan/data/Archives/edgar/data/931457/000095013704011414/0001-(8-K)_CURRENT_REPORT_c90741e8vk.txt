ITEM 4.02      NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A
               RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW.

         On December 18, 2004, Universal Automotive Industries, Inc. (the
"Company") received a letter (the "Letter") from its independent registered
public accountants, Blackman Kallick Bartelstein LLP ("Blackman"), advising it
that its presentation of "gain on valuation of assets purchased" is not properly
classified in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for
the periods ended September 30, June 30, and March 31, 2004. As a result of the
Letter and after discussions with Blackman, the Company's Audit Committee
determined to reclassify the "gain on valuation of assets purchased" as
recommended by Blackman. To reflect the reclassification, on December 23, 2004,
the Company has filed a Form 10-Q/A (Amendment No. 2) for the period ended
September 30, 2004 and a Form 10-Q/A (Amendment No. 1) for each of the periods
ended June 30, 2004 and March 31, 2004. The reclassification does not change the
Company's overall income or net worth for these periods but does impact the
classification of the income for such periods.

         The Letter from Blackman also advised the Company that Blackman is
withdrawing its letter of November 30, 2004 which stated that it had reviewed
the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 in
accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No.100, as amended, which was
filed as an exhibit to the Company's Form 10-Q/A (Amendment No.1) on December 3,
2004. The Letter from Blackman states that the November 30, 2004 letter from
Blackman was in error.

         The matters discussed in the Letter and the effect on the Company of
the reclassification are described under the heading "Explanatory Note"
contained in each Form 10-Q/A and such information is incorporated herein by
reference.

         In accordance with the instructions to Form 8-K, the Company has
provided Blackman a copy of this Form 8-K. Blackman has provided the Company and
SEC with a letter, dated December 23, 2004, a copy of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit 16.1 and incorporated herein by reference, stating that Blackman
agrees with the disclosures provided herein.

Exhibit        Description

16.1           Letter from Blackman Kallick Bartelstein LLP dated December 23,
               2004.
