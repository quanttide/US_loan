ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

     As previously reported, on December 23, 2004, Universal Automotive
Industries, Inc. (the "Company") filed an amended Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q/A for each of the periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2004.
The Quarterly Reports were filed to reclassify the Company's presentation of a
gain on valuation of assets purchased in the quarter ended March 31, 2004 from
"other expense:/(income)" to an "extraordinary item." As a result of the
reclassification of the gain in these periods, the Company would have been in
violation of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) covenant contained in its revolving line of credit agreement (the
"Credit Agreement") with its principal lender, Congress Financial Corporation
(Central) ("Congress"). As a result of this covenant violation, on December 23,
2004, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment") to the Credit
Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, Congress agrees to waive the covenant
violations for each month through September 2004.

     Additionally, the Amendment revises the Credit Agreement in the following
respects: (i) revises the Company's EBITDA covenant on a going forward basis to
more closely align the covenant with the Company's projections from operations;
(ii) obligates the Company to reduce its outstanding obligation under the Credit
Agreement by an amount equal to $3,000,000 on or before January 31, 2005,
payable from proceeds of the issuance of debt or equity; (iii) increases the
effective interest rate on the Company's borrowings by approximately 0.50% per
annum (currently, the interest rate is 1.25% plus prime rate); (iv) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Company's inventory borrowing limit to the lesser of:
(a) $13,500,000 or (b) a formula relating to certain inventory asset tests; (v)
increases the minimum excess availability under the Credit Agreement by $1
million (to a minimum of $2 million of excess availability); and (vi)
establishes new minimum sales covenants for the Company. In connection with the
execution of the Amendment, the Company agrees to pay Congress an amendment fee
equal to $100,000, payable in equal installments of $50,000 on January 31, 2005
and July 29, 2005.

                                   SIGNATURES

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Dated:  December 30, 2004
