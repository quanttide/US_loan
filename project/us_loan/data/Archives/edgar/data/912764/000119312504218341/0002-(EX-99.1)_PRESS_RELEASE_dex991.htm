ANNOUNCES PLAN TO DEREGISTER </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(Smithfield, North Carolina) December 22,
2004 &#150; KS Bancorp, Inc. (OTCBB: KSAV) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to deregister the Company&#146;s common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and, therefore, terminate its obligations
to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This &#147;going private&#148; transaction would be accomplished through a reverse 1-for-200 split of the Company&#146;s common stock to be followed immediately by a forward 250-for-1
split. If, after completion of the split transactions, KS Bancorp has fewer than 300 stockholders of record, the Company intends to terminate the registration of its common stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and become
a non-reporting company. If that occurs, the Company will no longer file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including annual reports on Form 10-KSB, and quarterly reports on Form 10-QSB, and it will no longer be subject to
the SEC&#146;s proxy rules. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;In addition to anticipated cost savings
resulting from the elimination of these reporting requirements, we expect that the reduced burden on management will allow our officers to focus more attention on our customers and the communities where we operate,&#148; stated CEO Harold Keen.
&#147;Remaining an independent community bank is important to us because of what we bring to our customers and stockholders,&#148; Mr. Keen added. &#147;We believe that this will help us achieve our institution&#146;s long-held goals.&#148;
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the split transactions, stockholders with less than 200 shares of KS
Bancorp common stock held of record in their name immediately before the reverse stock split will receive a cash payment equal to $24.00 per pre-split share. Stockholders holding 200 or more shares of KS Bancorp common stock immediately prior to the
effective time of the reverse stock split will be issued new shares. Initially, these stockholders will receive one new share of Company common stock for every 200 pre-split shares held immediately prior to the reverse stock split. In addition,
these stockholders will receive a cash payment equal to $24.00 for any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split. Those stockholders who continue to hold shares of KS Bancorp common stock after the reverse stock split and are not
fully cashed out will subsequently receive 250 shares of KS Bancorp common stock for each share owned following the reverse stock split in accordance with the forward stock split. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

to be paid in the proposed split transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to KS Bancorp&#146;s stockholders. The proposed split transaction is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock. Stockholders will be asked to approve the split transaction at a special meeting of stockholders, currently expected to be held in February 2005. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
