Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     On December 20, 2004, C. John Hipp, III, formerly a corporate director and
the President and Chief Executive Officer of SCBT Financial Corporation (the
"Company"), entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release of Claims
(the "Agreement") with the Company that is effective as of November 5, 2004.

     Under the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Hipp has confirmed his resignation
from all positions held by Mr. Hipp with the Company and its subsidiaries, and
the Company has agreed to (i) pay Mr. Hipp severance compensation of $294,000 in
one lump sum, (ii) transfer title to the Company automobile (2002 Buick Park
Avenue) used by Mr. Hipp prior to his resignation, (iii) continue to pay for Mr.
Hipp's health plan coverage through November 5, 2005 and (iv) vest in full Mr.
Hipp's options to acquire an aggregate of 10,280 shares of common stock of the
Company, which options would otherwise have expired unvested as a result of Mr.
Hipp's resignation. The Agreement also contains a mutual release of certain
claims that may be made by Mr. Hipp against the Company and the Company against
Mr. Hipp. The Agreement continues certain provisions of Mr. Hipp's Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement, dated September 30, 1999, between the Company and
