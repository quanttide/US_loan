<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The following summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the applicable provisions of our Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the &#147;Certificate of Incorporation&#148;) and
Amended and Restated Bylaws (the &#147;Bylaws&#148;), as they may be amended from time to
time, or of applicable statutory or other law, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference thereto. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation, as in effect on the date hereof, we have (i) 150,000,000 authorized shares
of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;), and (ii)
5,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
&#147;Preferred Stock&#148;). A Right (as defined below) currently attaches to each share
of Common Stock outstanding. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>Dividend Rights and
Restrictions</I>. The holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when and
as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor. Our
dividend policy is subject to change at any time at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. Covenants contained in our debt agreements from time to time may impose certain
restrictions regarding the payment of dividends. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>Voting Rights</I>. The holders of
Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote at any
meeting of stockholders. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the
act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is
required by Delaware law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the Bylaws. Under the
Certificate of Incorporation, amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation require the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of the
then outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single
class. In addition to amendments by the action of the Board of Directors, the Bylaws may
be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the combined
voting power of the then outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting
together as a single class. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The holders of Common Stock do not
have cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, the holders of a simple majority of the shares
voting at a meeting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors being
elected at such meeting (and the holders of the remaining shares will be unable to elect
any directors). </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>Liquidation Rights</I>. In the
event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of Common Stock are
entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to its
stockholders, subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock
that may then be outstanding. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Flush" FSL="Default" -->
     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>Assessability</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          When we have received the consideration determined by the Board of Directors to
          be paid for the issuance of shares of Common Stock, such shares are fully paid
          and non-assessable, except that, under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law,
          as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, our stockholders, as
          stockholders of a corporation which is qualified to do business and has its
          principal place of business in Wisconsin, may in certain circumstances be
          personally liable for debts owing to our employees for services performed for
          us, but not exceeding six months service in any one case. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>Other Matters</I>. Holders of
Common Stock, as such, do not have preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for unissued
stock or other securities of the Company. The shares of Common Stock are not subject or
entitled to the operation of a retirement or sinking fund. The shares of Common Stock are
not convertible into shares of Preferred Stock or into shares of any other class or series
of our capital stock. The Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ National Market. </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Certain Provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We are governed by the provisions of
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, the law prohibits a
public Delaware corporation from engaging in a &#147;business combination&#148; with an
&#147;interested stockholder&#148; for a period of three years after the time the person
became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a
prescribed manner. &#147;Business combination&#148; includes mergers, asset sales and
other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An
&#147;interested stockholder&#148; is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns (or, if currently an affiliate or associate of the corporation, within
three years did own) 15% or more of the corporation&#146;s voting stock. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Major Left Bold" FSL="Default" -->
<H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Preferred Stock </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Preferred Stock may be issued from
time to time in series having such designations, preferences and rights, and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine,
including the consideration to be received therefor, the number of shares comprising each
series, dividend rates, redemption provisions, liquidation preferences, mandatory
retirement provisions, conversion rights and voting rights (provided that no series shall
be nonvoting), all without any stockholder approval. Preferred Stock could be given voting
and conversion rights which would dilute the voting power and equity of holders of Common
Stock and could have preference over Common Stock with respect to dividends and
liquidation rights. The Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may issue
Preferred Stock with voting or conversion rights which could adversely affect the voting
power of the holders of Common Stock or which could be used as a defensive measure in
connection with an unsolicited attempt to acquire us. Certain fundamental matters
requiring stockholder approval (such as mergers, a sale of substantially all assets and
certain amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation) may require approval by the
separate vote of the holders of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock. None of the
Preferred Stock is outstanding as of the date hereof. In connection with the Preferred
Share Purchase Rights described below, 1,000,000 of the authorized shares of Preferred
Stock have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for issuance
upon exercise of the Rights. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On July 15, 2002, our Board of
Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a &#147;Right&#148;)
for each share of Common Stock, payable to the stockholders of record on August 5, 2002,
and with respect to all shares of Common Stock that become outstanding prior to the
earliest of the Distribution Date (as defined below), the redemption of the Rights and the
expiration of the Rights,. </FONT></P>

terms of the Rights Agreement as made between us and American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust
Company, a New York corporation, as rights agent, on July 16, 2002 (the &#147;Rights

this description is only a summary, and is not complete, and should be read together with
the entire Rights Agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report

initially trade with, and are inseparable from, the Common Stock. The Rights are evidenced
only by certificates that represent shares of Common Stock. New Rights will accompany any
new shares of Common Stock we issue after August 5, 2002 until the distribution date
described below. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->

will allow its holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (&#147;preferred share&#148;) for $100, once the Rights
become exercisable. This portion of a preferred share will give the stockholder
approximately the same dividend, voting, and liquidation rights as would one share of
Common Stock. Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting,
or liquidation rights. </FONT></P>
