I.       OVERVIEW OF THE EQUITY HOLDER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

         FN Estate, Inc., f/k/a Fastnet Corporation ("FN" or the "Debtor"), the
above-captioned parent debtor and debtor-in-possession, and its subsidiary
debtors-in-possession (collectively, the "Debtors") which are being jointly
administered in this case prepared this Disclosure Statement for Holders of
Equity Interests in the Debtors (the "Equity Holder Disclosure Statement") to
accompany and in connection with the solicitation by the Debtors and the
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the "Creditors' Committee") of the
Joint Plan of Liquidation dated December 30, 2004 (the "Plan"), filed in the
Debtors' reorganization proceedings (the "Chapter 11 Cases") under chapter 11 of
title 11, United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), pending in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the
"Bankruptcy Court"). After notice and hearing, and upon order of the Bankruptcy
Court entered January [__], 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved this Equity
Holder Disclosure Statement.

         Because Persons holding Equity Interests in the Debtors will not retain
or receive anything under the Plan, this Equity Holder Disclosure Statement,
provides only a summary of the Plan's treatment of Class 4 Equity Interests as
opposed to the treatment of all Claim and Interest holders, to summarize the
treatment of such interests under the Plan. A copy of the Plan is not attached
hereto, but is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Disclosure
Statement circulated to Claim holders (the "Claim Holder Disclosure Statement")
and a copy of the Plan are available upon request made to the Debtors' counsel
at the address set forth below. Please contact the Debtors' counsel with any
questions relating to the Plan.

                                DEBTORS
                    BY MAIL OR OVERNIGHT DELIVERY:

         SCHNADER HARRISON SEGAL & LEWIS LLP
         Attention: Nicholas J. LePore, III, Esquire
         1600 Market Street, Suite 3600
         Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103
         (215) 751-2286 (phone)


         You should read this Equity Holder Disclosure Statement and the Plan in
their entirety. No statements or information concerning the Debtors, their
subsidiaries or affiliates or any other entity described in this Equity Holder
Disclosure Statement or the Plan, particularly, but not limited to, the Debtors'
future business operations, profits, financial condition, assets or liabilities
are authorized by the Debtors other than as set forth in this Equity Holder
Disclosure Statement or the Claim Holder Disclosure Statement.

         The financial information set forth in this Equity Holder Disclosure
Statement has not been audited by independent certified public accountants. For
that reason, and as a result of the complexity of the financial affairs of the
Debtors (and their subsidiaries and/or affiliates, to the extent applicable),
the Debtors are not able to represent and warrant that the information set forth
in this Equity Holder Disclosure Statement is without any inaccuracy. To the
extent possible, however, the information has been prepared from the Debtors'
financial books and records, and every effort has been made to ensure that all
information in this Equity Holder Disclosure Statement has been fairly
presented.

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         A summary of the classification and treatment of Equity Interests under
the Plan is set forth below.

                  Class 4: Equity Interests
                  -------------------------

         All Equity Interests issued by the Debtors shall survive Confirmation.
However, each holder of an Equity Interest shall neither receive nor retain any
property or interest in Estate Property on account of such Equity Interest.
Equity Interest holders are enjoined from taking actions detrimental to the
liquidation of the Debtors Estates, taking actions contrary to the terms of the
Plan, and taking actions that would impede the implementation of the provisions
of the Plan in any way. Those holding Equity Interests are also enjoined from
transferring such Equity Interests. In accordance with Section 6.6, all Equity
Interests will be cancelled after the Plan has been fully implemented and the
Administrative Agent files the appropriate articles of dissolution. On or before
the dissolution of the Debtors' corporate existence, the Debtors will file with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 15 for the purpose
of terminating the registration of any of its publicly traded securities.

         Class 4 is impaired under the Plan and shall receive nothing under the
Plan. The holders of Class 4 Equity Interests are deemed to reject the Plan.
Consequently, holders of Class 4 Equity Interests are not entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan.

III.     CANCELLATION OF EXISTING SECURITIES AND AGREEMENTS

         All Equity Interests issued by the Debtors shall survive Confirmation.
However, each holder of an Equity Interest shall neither receive nor retain any
property or interest in Estate Property on account of such Equity Interest.
Equity Interest holders are enjoined from taking actions detrimental to the
liquidation of the Debtors Estates, taking actions contrary to the terms of the
Plan, and taking actions that would impede the implementation of the provisions
of the Plan in any way. Those holding Equity Interests are also enjoined from
transferring such Equity Interests. In accordance with Section 6.6 of the Plan,
all Equity Interests will be cancelled after the Plan has been fully implemented
and the Administrative Agent files the appropriate articles of dissolution.

IV.      DISCHARGE OF CLAIMS AND DEBTS AND TERMINATION OF EQUITY INTERESTS

         Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Confirmation
Order, the rights afforded in the Plan and the payments and distributions to be
made thereunder shall discharge all existing debts and Claims, and terminate all
Equity Interests of any kind, nature or description whatsoever against or in the
Debtors or any of their assets or properties to the fullest extent permitted by
section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or
in the Confirmation Order, upon the Effective Date, all existing Claims against
the Debtors and Equity Interests in the Debtors, shall be, and shall be deemed
to be, discharged and terminated, and all holders of Claims and Equity Interests
shall be precluded and enjoined from asserting against the Debtors, or any of
their assets or properties, any other or further Claim or Equity Interest based
upon any act or omission, transaction or other activity of any kind or nature
that occurred prior to the Effective Date, whether or not such holder has filed
a proof of Claim or proof of Equity Interest.

V.       RELEASES

         In consideration of the efforts expended and to be expended by the
Debtors, the Creditors' Committee and the Administrative Agent, and former
officers and directors (other than those subject to potential Causes of Action
as described in the Plan) in conjunction with their operational and financial
restructuring during the Chapter 11 Cases, on the Effective Date, the Debtors
will automatically release and will be deemed to release any and all Claims
(including any Claims arising out of any alleged fiduciary or other duty) that


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

it has or may have against the Administrative Agent and its professionals, the
Creditors' Committee and its professionals, the Debtors' professionals, and any
of the Debtors' officers and directors (other than those subject to potential
Causes of Action as described in the Plan) who held such positions after the
Commencement Date in their capacities as such, arising or based upon any
actions, conduct or omissions occurring after the Commencement Date and prior to
the Effective Date, excluding willful misconduct and gross negligence (the
"Release Parties"). The Confirmation Order shall constitute an order approving
the compromise, settlement and release of any and all such claims pursuant to
Section 1123(b)(3)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. To the full extent permitted by
applicable Law, each holder of a Claim (whether or not Allowed) against or
Equity Interest in the Debtors shall be enjoined from commencing or continuing
any action, employment of process or act to collect, offset or recover and shall
be deemed to release any Claim against the Release Parties for actions occurring
prior to the Effective Date, excluding, however, willful misconduct and gross
negligence.

VI.      EXCULPATION

         Neither the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, the Administrative
Agent, nor any of their respective members, officers, directors, employees,
advisors, professionals or agents, (collectively, "Exculpation Parties") shall
have or incur any liability to any holder of a Claim or Equity Interest for any
act or omission in connection with, related to, or arising out of the Chapter 11
Cases, negotiations regarding or concerning the Plan, the pursuit of
confirmation of the Plan, the consummation of the Plan, or the administration of
the Plan or the property to be distributed under the Plan, except for willful
misconduct or gross negligence, and, in all respects, the Exculpation Parties
shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel with respect to their
duties and responsibilities under the Plan.
