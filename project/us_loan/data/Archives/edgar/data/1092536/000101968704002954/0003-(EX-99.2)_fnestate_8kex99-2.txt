                    FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA

In re:                                         :  Chapter 11
                                               :
FN ESTATE, INC., ET AL.,                       :  Case No. 03-23143 (TMT)

               Debtors.                        : (Jointly Administered)
                                               :

I.       OVERVIEW OF THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

                         PURPOSE OF DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
                         -------------------------------

         FN Estate, Inc., f/k/a Fastnet Corporation ("FN" or the "Debtor"), the
above-captioned parent debtor and debtor-in-possession, and its subsidiary
debtors-in-possession (collectively, the "Debtors") which are being jointly
administered in this case prepared this Disclosure Statement ("Disclosure
Statement") to accompany and in connection with the solicitation by the Debtors
and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the "Creditors' Committee")
of the Joint Plan of Liquidation dated December 30, 2004 (the "Plan"), filed in
the Debtors' reorganization proceedings (the "Chapter 11 Cases") under chapter
11 of title 11, United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), pending in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the
"Bankruptcy Court"). After notice and hearing, and upon order of the Bankruptcy
Court entered January [__], 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved this Disclosure
Statement as containing information of a kind and in sufficient detail that
would enable a hypothetical reasonable investor, typical of holders of claims
and interests of the classes being solicited, to make an informed judgment
whether to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

         A copy of the Plan is attached to this Disclosure Statement and
incorporated into this Disclosure Statement by reference as EXHIBIT A. A copy of
the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving this Disclosure Statement
accompanies this Disclosure Statement as EXHIBIT B.

         You should read this Disclosure Statement and the Plan in their
entirety before voting on the Plan. No statements or information concerning the
Debtors, their subsidiaries or affiliates or any other entity described in this
Disclosure Statement or the Plan, particularly, but not limited to, the Debtors'
future business operations, profits, financial condition, assets or liabilities
are authorized by the Debtors other than as set forth in this Disclosure
Statement or Exhibits hereto.

         The financial information set forth in this Disclosure Statement has
not been audited by independent certified public accountants. For that reason,
and as a result of the complexity of the financial affairs of the Debtors (and
their subsidiaries and/or affiliates, to the extent applicable), the Debtors are
not able to represent and warrant that the information set forth in this
Disclosure Statement is without any inaccuracy. To the extent possible, however,
the information has been prepared from the Debtors' financial books and records,
and every effort has been made to ensure that all information in this Disclosure
Statement has been fairly presented.

                             PROCEDURAL INFORMATION
                             ----------------------

VOTING

         Each holder of a Claim or Equity Interest of a Class that is "Impaired"
under the Plan, but is not deemed to have rejected the Plan, will receive this
Disclosure Statement, the Plan, the Voting Procedures Order, notice of the
Confirmation Hearing and a ballot for accepting or rejecting the Plan. Any


                                       1
<PAGE>

holder of a Claim or Equity Interest whose legal, contractual or equitable
rights are altered, modified or changed by the proposed treatment under the
Plan, or whose treatment under the Plan is not provided for in section 1124 of
the Bankruptcy Code, is considered "Impaired." Each holder of a Claim or Equity
Interest of a Class that is deemed to accept or reject the Plan will receive the
Voting Procedures Order, notice of the Confirmation Hearing and a notice of
non-voting status in the form approved by the Bankruptcy Court, but will not
receive a ballot and will not be eligible to vote on the Plan. Holders of Claims
or Equity Interests of a Class deemed to accept or reject the Plan will not
receive copies of the Plan or the Disclosure Statement, but may obtain copies of
these documents by mailing a written request for such materials to the Balloting
Agent identified below.

      --------------------------------------------------------------------
          WHICH CLASSES OF CLAIMS ARE ENTITLED TO VOTE ON THE PLAN?

       Classes of Claims are entitled to vote on the Plan as follows:

       o   Claims in Class 2 are Impaired and entitled to vote on the
           Plan (the "Voting Class").

       o   Claims in Class 1 are unimpaired under the Plan, are deemed to
           have accepted the Plan and will not be entitled to vote on the
           Plan.

       o   Claims in Class 3 and Equity Interests in Class 4 will receive
           no distribution under the Plan, are deemed to have rejected
           the Plan and will not be entitled to vote on the Plan.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------

         For a description of the Classes of Claims and Equity Interests and
their respective treatment under the Plan, see Subsections (A), (B) and (C) of
Section VI below.

         You may only vote on the Plan with respect to a Claim or Equity
Interest if that Claim belongs to the Voting Class under the Plan. All holders
of Claims in Class 3 and Equity Interests in Class 4 are deemed to have rejected
the Plan and will not be entitled to vote. The Bankruptcy Court has fixed
January [__], 2005, as the voting record date. To be eligible to vote on the
Plan, persons with Claims that belong to the Voting Class must have held them on
the voting record date.

         Under the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan will be deemed accepted by an
Impaired Class of Claims if the Debtors receive votes accepting the Plan
representing at least:

         o        two-thirds of the total dollar amount of the allowed Claims in
                  the Class that cast a vote; and

         o        more than one-half of the total number of allowed Claims in
                  the Class that cast a vote.

         The Voting Procedures Order will set forth which Claims are "allowed"
for purposes of voting and designate the form of ballot to be used by each
Voting Class. For more information on voting procedures, please consult the
Voting Procedures Order.

         All properly completed ballots received by the Debtors before 4:00 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on March [__], 2005 (the "Voting Deadline"), will be counted in
determining whether each Impaired Class entitled to vote on the Plan has
accepted the Plan. Any ballots received after the Voting Deadline will not be
counted. All ballots must contain an original signature to be counted. No
ballots received by facsimile will be accepted.

                             VOTING ON THE PLAN

         WHEN DOES THE VOTE NEED TO BE RECEIVED? The deadline for the
         receipt by the Balloting Agent of properly completed ballots is
         4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), March [__], 2005.

         WHICH CLASSES MAY VOTE? Persons may vote to accept or reject the
         Plan only with respect to Allowed Claims that belong to a Class
         that is Impaired under the Plan and is not deemed to have rejected
         the Plan. The only Impaired Class that is entitled to vote is
         Class 2.

         WHICH MEMBERS OF THE IMPAIRED CLASSES MAY VOTE? The VOTING RECORD
         date for determining which members of Impaired Classes may vote on
         the Plan is January [__], 2005. Persons may vote on the Plan only
         with respect to Claims that were held on the voting record date.

         HOW DO I VOTE ON THE PLAN? For a vote to be counted, the Debtors
         must receive an original signed copy of the ballot form approved
         by the Bankruptcy Court. Faxed copies and votes sent on other
         forms will not be accepted.

         WHO SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR NEED A BALLOT? You may
         contact the Debtors at the address or phone number listed below.
         ------------------------------------------------------------------

         This Disclosure Statement and the Plan are the only materials that you
should use in determining how to vote on the Plan. The Debtors and the
Creditors' Committee believe that approval of the Plan provides the greatest
return to holders of Claims in the Voting Class.

         -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                 VOTING RECOMMENDATIONS

         The Debtors and the Creditors' Committee believe that the Plan
         presents the best opportunity for holders of Claims to maximize
         their respective recoveries. THE DEBTORS AND THE CREDITORS'
         COMMITTEE ENCOURAGE HOLDERS OF IMPAIRED CLAIMS IN CLASS 2 TO VOTE
         TO ACCEPT THE PLAN.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------

         The ballots have been specifically designed for the purpose of
soliciting votes on the Plan from each Class entitled to vote. For this reason,
in voting on the Plan, please use only the ballot sent to you with this
Disclosure Statement. If you believe you have received the incorrect form of
ballot, you need another ballot or you have any questions concerning the form of
ballot, please contact the Debtors.

         Please complete and sign your ballot and return it in the enclosed
pre-addressed envelope to the Debtors. All correspondence in connection with
voting on the Plan should be directed to the Debtors at the following address:

         The Debtors will prepare and file with the Bankruptcy Court a
certification of the results of the voting on the Plan on a Class-by-Class
basis.

         Additional copies of the ballots, this Disclosure Statement and the
Plan are available upon request made to the Debtors. Please contact the Debtors
with any questions relating to voting on the Plan.

         -------------------------------------------------------------
                           YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

         Your vote on the Plan is important because:

         o    Under the Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can only be
              confirmed if certain majorities in dollar amount and
              number of claims (as described above) of each Voting
              Class under the plan vote to accept the plan.

         o    Under the Bankruptcy Code, only the votes of those
              holders of claims or interests who actually submit votes
              on a plan are counted in determining whether the
              specified majorities of votes in favor of the plan have
              been received.

         o    If you are eligible to vote with respect to a Claim and
              do not deliver a properly completed ballot relating to
              that Claim by the Voting Deadline, you will be deemed to
              have abstained from voting with respect to that Claim and
              your eligibility to vote with respect to that Claim will
              NOT be considered in determining the number and dollar
              amount of ballots needed to make up the specified
              majority of that Claim's Class for the purpose of
              approving the Plan.

III.     GENERAL INFORMATION

         A.       OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 11

         Chapter 11 is the primary business reorganization chapter of the
Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is authorized
to reorganize its business and affairs for itself, its creditors and its equity
interest holders. In addition to permitting the rehabilitation of a debtor,
another goal of chapter 11 is to promote equality of treatment for similarly
situated creditors and similarly situated equity interest holders with respect
to distributions of the value of a debtor's assets.

         The commencement of a chapter 11 case creates a bankruptcy estate that
is comprised of all of the legal and equitable interests of a debtor as of the
commencement date of the chapter 11 case. The Bankruptcy Code provides that a
debtor may continue to operate its business and affairs and remain in possession
of its property as a "debtor-in-possession".

         The consummation of a plan is the fundamental objective of a chapter 11
reorganization case. A plan sets forth the means for satisfying claims against
and interests in a debtor. Confirmation of a plan by a bankruptcy court binds
the debtor, any issuer of securities under the plan, any person acquiring
property under the plan, and any creditor or equity interest holder of a debtor.
Pursuant to section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code, a plan may provide for
the liquidation of the debtor.

         Certain holders of claims against and interests in a debtor are
permitted to vote to accept or reject the plan. Prior to soliciting acceptances
of the proposed plan, however, section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code requires a
debtor to prepare a disclosure statement containing adequate information of a
kind, and in sufficient detail, to enable a hypothetical reasonable investor to
make an informed judgment regarding the plan. The Debtors are submitting this
Disclosure Statement to holders of Claims against and Equity Interests in the
Debtors to satisfy the requirements of section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code.

         B.       DESCRIPTION OF DEBTORS

                  1.       The Debtors
                           -----------

         Prior to the Petition Date, Fastnet Corporation and its subsidiaries
provided Internet access and enhanced products and services to its customers
since 1994. Fastnet was an Internet Service Provider ("ISP") offering narrow and
broadband data communication services and enhanced products and services to
individuals and businesses primarily in primary and second-tier markets in the
mid-Atlantic portion of the United States. Fastnet's services included
high-speed data and Internet services, data center services, including web
hosting and managed and unmanaged colocation services, small office-home office
("SOHO") Internet access, wholesale colocation services, and various
professional services including eSolutions, web design and development. Fastnet
focused its sales and marketing efforts on businesses in the markets they served
using the value proposition of combining its technical expertise with dedicated
customer care. Fastnet approached its customers from an access carrier neutral
position, providing connectivity over a variety of available technologies. These
included classic Telco provided point-to-point, ISDN, SMDS, ATM, and DSL and
non-classic such as Layer 2 Ethernet.

                  2.       Employees
                           ---------

         As of the Petition Date, the Debtors employed approximately 140
persons. After the filing, the Debtors reduced their workforce as they sold off
their operating assets in a series of Bankruptcy Court approved sales and began
to winddown operations. Many employees became employed by US LEC Corporation
("US LEC") after the Debtors sold substantially all of their assets to US LEC,
as discussed below.

                  3.       Retention of Certain Personnel
                           ------------------------------

         On or about September 15, 2003, the Debtors filed a MOTION OF THE
DEBTORS AND DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION FOR AUTHORIZATION TO IMPLEMENT KEY EMPLOYEE
COMPENSATION PROGRAM (the "KERP Motion"). On October 9, 2003, the Court entered
an Order approving the KERP Motion. Pursuant to the KERP Motion and Order, the
Debtors were authorized to provide certain incentives to forestall employee
attrition during the pendency of the Debtors' chapter 11 cases. The compensation
program provided for four separate but integrated components of compensation
payable to employee participants: (i) a key employee retention plan; (ii) a
severance plan; (iii) loan forgiveness offered to retain certain key employees;
and (iv) incentive compensation offered to incentivize the Debtors' Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to remain with the Debtors, to
maintain the Debtors' operations as a going concern, and to position the Debtors
for maximum value or sale price.

         On or about August 6, 2004, the Debtors filed a MOTION OF THE DEBTORS
AND DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION FOR AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS FOR
CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES (the "Winddown Employment Motion"). An
Order approving the Winddown Employment Motion was entered by the Court on
October 7, 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the Winddown Employment Motion and
Order, the Debtors were authorized to retain and incentivize two employees
necessary to the winddown of the Debtors' operations and the collection of
outstanding accounts receivable. The Debtors currently have two full-time
employees. This number includes the Chief Executive Officer, but excludes
professionals.

IV.      THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

         A.       THE DEBTORS' CHAPTER 11 FILINGS

         During the second quarter of 2003, the Debtors entered into
negotiations with their vendors to reorganize outside of bankruptcy. The
Debtors' efforts to restructure outside of bankruptcy were unsuccessful, and on
June 10, 2003, Fastnet Corporation and on June 13, 2003, each of its debtor
subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The cases have been jointly administered for procedural
purposes only at Case No. 03-23143(TMT). The Debtors have continued to manage
their properties and operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession in
accordance with sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.

         B.       THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS

         On June 20, 2003, the United States Trustee formed the Creditors'
Committee. The Creditors' Committee was initially composed of Robert L. Bast;
Applied Theory, Inc.; PPL Telecom, LLC; Operating Telephone Subsidiaries of
Verizon Communications, Inc.; Jeffrey J. Pasquale; and PECO/Telcove. Robert Bast
has since resigned due to a conflict of interest. PECO/Telcove was a joint
venture and PECO served as the initial representative on the Committee. The
joint venture has since dissolved and Telcove now sits on the Committee.

         C.       COMPLIANCE WITH BANKRUPTCY CODE, BANKRUPTCY RULES, LOCAL COURT
                  RULES AND UNITED STATES TRUSTEE DEADLINES

         On July 16, 2003, the Debtors filed their respective Statements of
Financial Affairs, Schedules of Assets and Liabilities, and lists of Equity
Security Holders. On __________, 200_, the Debtors filed an Amendment to
Schedule F of their Schedules of Assets and Liabilities. On October 22, 2003,
the United States Trustee conducted a meeting of creditors pursuant to section
341 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors have filed all monthly operating reports
through September 2004, and have timely paid all statutory quarterly fees as
required by the Office of the United States Trustee. To the best of the Debtors'
knowledge, information and belief, the Debtors have complied with all other
applicable requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules, as well as
local Bankruptcy Court rules and deadlines of the Office of the United States
Trustee.

         D.       MARKETING OF THE DEBTORS' OPERATIONS

         As a result of prior operating results and significant cash flow
problems, on or about October 3, 2002, the Debtors engaged DH Capital LLC
("DHC") as investment bankers for the purpose of assisting them in raising debt
or equity investments, or identifying a possible acquirer for the stock or
assets of the Debtors. In connection with its prepetition engagement, DHC
contacted many potential strategic and financial buyers, however, no purchaser
resulted from these prepetition efforts.

         As a result of its extensive knowledge of the Debtors and their
industry, the Debtors again engaged DHC to assist in the marketing process after
the Petition Date. DHC's retention was approved by Order dated September 2,
2003, and effective as of July 16, 2003. DHC's postpetition marketing efforts
began on or about August 1, 2003. As a result of extensive, lengthy and open
marketing efforts, the Debtors entered into an asset purchase agreement with US
LEC for the sale of substantially all of their assets. Not all of the Debtors'
assets were sold to US LEC, however, and the Debtors continued to market their
remaining assets. The eventual sale of these remaining assets was the result of
the Debtors' continued efforts.


                                       9
<PAGE>

         E.       AUCTION AND SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DEBTORS' ASSETS

         Through the bankruptcy process, the Debtors sold substantially all of
their assets through a series of Bankruptcy Court approved sales.

         First, on December 15, 2003, the Debtors closed on the sale of
substantially all of their assets, including their Broadband and Dial Up
Internet Access, Co-location, and Managed Hosting business units, to US LEC for
approximately $8.5 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The $8.5
million consisted of approximately $6 million in cash, a $1.5 million promissory
note, and US LEC Class A common stock with a market value of approximately $1
million at closing. The Bankruptcy Court entered an Order approving the US LEC
sale on December 4, 2003.

         Second, on January 8, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order
granting the Debtors' motion to sell their E-Solutions and web development and
design business to a group of noteholders of NetReach, Inc., a subsidiary of the
Debtors, in exchange for the surrender and transfer to the Debtors of promissory
notes in the aggregate principal amount of $766,000, a general release of the
Debtors by the noteholders, an assumption of certain severance obligations to
transferred employees, and the assumption of all liabilities under the lease of
the Ambler Office.

         Third, on April 13, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order
granting the Debtors' motion to sell certain equipment that was no longer in use
to the Townsend Assets Group for approximately $241,550.

         Fourth, on April 22, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order
granting the Debtors' motion to sell all of their information relating to
certain customers in connection with their operations in the State of New York
to Choice One Communications of New York, Inc. Choice One is obligated to pay
the Debtors a percentage of the fees collected by Choice One on or before April
30, 2005 from the customers that migrated to Choice One on or before June 30,
2004.

         Finally, on April 23, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order
approving the Debtors' motion to sell substantially all of their assets used or
associated with their wireless Internet access operations located in Rochester,
New York to CBTEK, LLC for approximately $155,000, plus the assumption of
certain liabilities.

         F.       SETTLEMENTS

         During the pendency of these cases, the Debtors have entered into many
Court approved settlements in an effort to maximize the value of the Estates for
the benefit of all creditors while minimizing the administrative and legal costs
associated with litigating the underlying disputes. The Bankruptcy Court has
entered Orders approving settlements between the Debtors and: Akami
Technologies; Cable and Wireless PLC and Cable & Wireless IDC; Cisco Systems
Capital Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc.; John G. Englesson; Equinox Business
Credit; General Electric Capital Corporation; GMAC; Hostway Corporation; Lee
Park Investors; NYSERNet; J. Robert Seder; Sunrise International Leasing
Corporation; and US LEC.

         G.       EXTENSION OF THE DEBTORS' EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS

         Section 1121(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides for an initial period
of 120 days after the filing of a voluntary chapter 11 petition during which a
debtor has the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization. Section
1121(c)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that if a debtor files a plan of
reorganization within such 120 day period, the debtor has a period of 180 days


                                       10
<PAGE>

from the filing of its voluntary petition for relief to obtain acceptances of
such plan, during which time competing plans may not be filed. The Debtors'
exclusive periods were originally set to expire on October 8, 2003, and December
8, 2003, respectively.

         During the pendency of these Cases, the Debtors' exclusive periods were
extended as follows: (1) by Order dated October 30, 2003, through December 31,
2003 and June 28, 2004; (2) by Order dated January 28, 2004, through February
28, 2004 and May 28, 2004; (3) by Order dated April 6, 2004, through April 30,
2004 and June 30, 2004; (4) by Order dated May 27, 2004, through June 30, 2004
and August 31, 2004; (5) by Order dated August 18, 2004, through August 31, 2004
and October 31, 2004; (6) by Order dated October 12, 2004, through October 31,
2004 and December 31, 2004; and (7) by Order dated November 24, 2004, through
December 31, 2004 and February 28, 2005.

                  3.       Compensation and Reimbursement Claims.
                           --------------------------------------

         Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ss. 1930(a)(6), a debtor is obligated to continue

         C.       CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF ALLOWED CLAIMS AND EQUITY
                  INTERESTS

         The Plan divides Allowed Claims against and Allowed Equity Interests in

the classification requirements established by the Bankruptcy Code. Distribution
of Cash to the holders of Allowed Claims under the Plan are in full satisfaction
of such Allowed Claims (including any and all interest or costs accrued and
allowable thereon). All Claims against and Equity Interests in the Debtors
arising prior to the Commencement Date will be discharged under the Plan on the
Effective Date of the Plan to the extent provided in the Plan or the
Confirmation Order.

         A summary of the classification and treatment of Allowed Claims and
Allowed Interests under the Plan is set forth below.

                  1.       Class 1: Priority Non-Tax Claims
                           --------------------------------

         Distribution: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Priority
Non-Tax Claim against the Debtors agrees to a different treatment of such Claim,
on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, each
such holder shall receive a Pro Rata Share of all remaining Cash after payment
of all Allowed Claims in sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 of the Plan.

         CLASS 1 IS UNIMPAIRED UNDER THE PLAN. EACH HOLDER OF AN ALLOWED CLASS 1
CLAIM IS CONCLUSIVELY PRESUMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE PLAN, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IS
NOT ENTITLED TO VOTE TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN.

                  2.       Class 2: General Unsecured Claims
                           ---------------------------------

         Distribution: The holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims shall
receive their Pro Rata Share of all remaining Cash after payment in full of all
Allowed Claims in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 4.1 of the Plan, and all
Post-Confirmation Expenses, through multiple distributions, the first of which
shall occur on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

         CLASS 2 IS IMPAIRED UNDER THE PLAN. HOLDERS OF ALLOWED CLASS 2 CLAIMS
ARE ENTITLED TO VOTE TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN

                  3.       Class 3: Daslic Claim
                           ---------------------

         The holder of the Daslic Claim shall neither receive nor retain any
property or interest in Estate Property on account of such Claim.

         CLASS 3 IS IMPAIRED UNDER THE PLAN AND SHALL RECEIVE NOTHING UNDER THE
PLAN. THE HOLDER OF THE ALLOWED CLASS 3 CLAIM IS DEEMED TO REJECT THE PLAN.
CONSEQUENTLY, THE HOLDER OF THE ALLOWED CLASS 3 CLAIM IS NOT ENTITLED TO VOTE TO
ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN.

                  4.       Class 4: Equity Interests
                           -------------------------

         All Equity Interests issued by the Debtors shall survive Confirmation.
However, each holder of an Equity Interest shall neither receive nor retain any
property or interest in Estate Property on account of such Equity Interest.
Equity Interest holders are enjoined from taking actions detrimental to the
liquidation of the Debtors Estates, taking actions contrary to the terms of the
Plan, and taking actions that would impede the implementation of the provisions
of the Plan in any way. Those holding Equity Interests are also enjoined from
transferring such Equity Interests. In accordance with Section 6.6, all Equity
Interests will be cancelled after the Plan has been fully implemented and the
Administrative Agent files the appropriate articles of dissolution. On or before
the dissolution of the Debtors' corporate existence, the Debtors will file with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 15 for the purpose
of terminating the registration of any of its publicly traded securities.

         CLASS 4 IS IMPAIRED UNDER THE PLAN AND SHALL RECEIVE NOTHING UNDER THE
PLAN. THE HOLDERS OF ALLOWED CLASS 4 EQUITY INTERESTS ARE DEEMED TO REJECT THE
PLAN. CONSEQUENTLY, HOLDERS OF ALLOWED CLASS 4 EQUITY INTERESTS ARE NOT ENTITLED

         D.       CLAIMS BAR DATES

         On October 2, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an ORDER GRANTING
MOTION OF DEBTORS AND DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION TO: (A) FIX A BAR DATE FOR FILING
PROOFS OF CLAIM, (B) APPROVE THE PROPOSED BAR DATE NOTICE, AND (C) APPROVE THE
PROPOSED NOTICE PROCEDURES (the "Bar Date Order"), which established a Claims
Bar Date for the filing of proofs of claim or interest for all creditors of the
Debtors, including, without limitation, holders of executory contracts and
unexpired leases of the Debtors (other than for Administrative Expense Claims)
of November 15, 2003 ("Bar Date"). The Bar Date Order provides, in pertinent
part: "ORDERED, that any holder of a claim against the Debtors who (i) is
required to file a proof of claim for such claim in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Order and (ii) fails to timely file such proof of claim
shall be forever barred, estopped and enjoined from asserting such claim against
the Debtors (or filing a proof of claim with respect thereto) and the Debtors
and their property shall be forever discharged from any and all indebtedness or
liability with respect to such claim, and such holder shall not be permitted to
vote on a plan of reorganization or participate in any distribution in the
Debtors' chapter 11 cases on account of such claim or to receive further notices
regarding such claim ...." Accordingly, to the extent a proof of claim was not
filed by the applicable bar date, such Claim shall not be an "Allowed Claim" as
defined in the Plan.

         On January 29, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an ORDER GRANTING
MOTION OF THE DEBTORS AND DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION TO FIX SUPPLEMENTAL BAR DATE FOR
FILING PROOFS OF CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN REJECTED CONTRACTS AND LEASES
PURSUANT TO 11 U.S.C. SS. 502(G) AND FED. R. BANKR. P. 2002(A)(7) AND
3002(C)(4), pursuant to which creditors asserting rejection damage claims
arising from the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease under the
US LEC Sale Order were required to file a proof of claim for such damages on or
before February 27, 2004.

         E.       CONFIRMATION HEARING

         The Bankruptcy Court will hold the Confirmation Hearing at

         F.       CANCELLATION OF EXISTING SECURITIES AND AGREEMENTS

         All Equity Interests issued by the Debtors shall survive Confirmation.
However, each holder of an Equity Interest shall neither receive nor retain any
property or interest in Estate Property on account of such Equity Interest.
Equity Interest holders are enjoined from taking actions detrimental to the
liquidation of the Debtors Estates, taking actions contrary to the terms of the
Plan, and taking actions that would impede the implementation of the provisions
of the Plan in any way. Those holding Equity Interests are also enjoined from
transferring such Equity Interests. In accordance with Section 6.6, all Equity
Interests will be cancelled after the Plan has been fully implemented and the
Administrative Agent files the appropriate articles of dissolution.

         G.       MEANS OF EXECUTING THE PLAN

                  1.       Implementation of the Plan
                           --------------------------

         If the Plan is confirmed and approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan
will be implemented through the actions described in this Section of the
Disclosure Statement and in the Plan. In accordance with the terms of the Plan,
the Debtors will:

         o        make multiple Cash payments to holders of Allowed Claims, the
                  first of which shall occur on the Effective Date or as soon
                  thereafter as is reasonably practicable;

         o        execute and/or deliver other documents or instruments required
                  by the Plan on the Effective Date.

                  2.       Substantive Consolidation
                           -------------------------

         Pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the Plan, the Debtors are seeking,
for all purposes related to the Plan, including, without limitation, voting,
confirmation and distribution purposes, the substantive consolidation of the
Estates of the Debtors, including, without limitation, all assets and
liabilities of the Debtors, without duplication, and without any Intercompany


                                       15
<PAGE>

Claims, which are deemed discharged. Therefore, if confirmed, the Plan will have
the following effect on and after the Effective Date, (i) all assets and
liabilities of the Debtors and the Debtor Subsidiaries shall be treated as
though they were merged, (ii) no distributions shall be made under the Plan on
account of any Claim held by any of the Debtors on account of Intercompany
Claims, (iii) no distributions shall be made under the Plan on account of any
Equity Interests held by any of the Debtors in any other of the Debtors, (iv)
all guarantees or agreements to act as surety by any of the Debtors of the
obligations of any of the other Debtors shall be eliminated such that any Claim
against any of the Debtors and any guaranty or agreement to act as surety
therefor executed by any of the Debtors and any joint or several liability of
any of the Debtors shall be one obligation of all of the Debtors, and (v) each
and every Claim filed or to be filed in these Chapter 11 Cases of any of the
Debtors shall be deemed filed against all of the Debtors, and shall be one Claim
against and obligation of all of the Debtors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
substantive consolidation effected pursuant to Section 6.1(a) of the Plan shall
not (other than for purposes related to the Plan) affect: (i): the legal and
organizational structures of the Debtors; (ii) the validity or enforceability of
any post-Commencement Date executory contracts or unexpired leases entered into
by any one or more of the Debtors; or (iii) defenses to any Causes of Action or
requirements for any third party to establish mutuality in order to assert a
right of setoff. Unless an objection to such substantive consolidation is made
in writing by any creditor affected by the Plan on or before the deadline set by
the Court for the filing of objections to confirmation of the Plan, an order
(which may be the Confirmation Order) approving limited substantive
consolidation may be entered by the Court. In the event any such objections are
timely filed, a hearing with respect thereto shall occur at the Confirmation
Hearing. Notwithstanding such substantive consolidation, if granted, nothing in
the Plan shall affect the obligation of each of the Debtors to pay quarterly
fees to the United States Trustee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ss. 1930(a)(6).

                  3.       Oversight Board

majority vote of the members of the Oversight Board, the Oversight Board may (i)

Administrative Agent from office only for: (i) fraud, willful misconduct, or
gross negligence in connection with its duties under the Plan, including the
liquidation of the Debtors and the Estate Property; (ii) such physical or mental

                                             (xi) establish funds, reserves and
accounts, as deemed by the Administrative Agent in its discretion to be useful
in carrying out the purposes of the Plan;

                                             (xii) sue and be sued and
participate, as a party or otherwise, in any judicial, administrative,
arbitrative or other proceeding;

                                             (xiii) delegate any or all of the
discretionary power and authority conferred with respect to all or any portion
of the Estate Property to any one or more reputable individuals or recognized
institutional advisors or investment managers without liability for any action
taken or omission made because of any such delegation except for such liability
as is provided in the Plan;

                                             (xiv) consult with the Oversight
Board at such times and regarding such issues relating to the liquidation of the
Debtors and Estate Property as are desirable or required in accordance with the
terms of the Plan;

                                             (xv) execute, deliver, and perform
such other agreements and documents and to take or cause to be taken any and all
such other actions as may be necessary or desirable to effectuate and carry out
the purposes of the Plan;

                                             (xvi) undertake any action
necessary to maintain the corporate existence and/or dissolve the Debtors
pursuant to applicable law;

                                             (xvii) undertake any action
necessary to ensure that the Debtors are and remain in good standing and
compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws;

                                             (xviii) file any federal, state, or
local tax returns and provide for the payment of any related taxes; and

                                             (xiv) undertake any action or
perform any obligation provided for or required under the Plan.

                                    (C) EMPLOYMENT AND COMPENSATION OF
PROFESSIONALS. The Administrative Agent shall have the authority to retain and
compensate Reed Smith LLP ("Reed Smith") and Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis LLP
("SHS&L") as counsel to represent it in connection with its duties and
responsibilities under the Plan. The Administrative Agent shall also have the
authority to retain and compensate such other attorneys, accountants, investment
advisors, and other professionals as the Administrative Agent may determine to


                                       19
<PAGE>

be necessary or appropriate in carrying out the provisions of the Plan. The
Administrative Agent may pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
professionals without application to the Bankruptcy Court. The fees and expenses
of the Administrative Agent and its professionals are, however, subject to
review and approval by the Oversight Board as provided for in Section 6.7 of the
Plan.

         Reed Smith and SHS&L shall be retained by the Administrative Agent on
an hourly-rate basis, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Reed Smith and
SHS&L shall be compensated at the regular hourly rates for both attorneys and
paralegals. The current hourly rates for Reed Smith attorneys and paralegals are
as follows: $125 to $175 for paralegals; $165 to $375 for associates; and $285
to $605 for partners. The current hourly rates for SHS&L attorneys and
paralegals are as follows: $90 to $170 for paralegals; $125 to $270 for
associates; and $235 to $480 for partners. These hourly rates are subject to
normal periodic adjustments. Invoices for payment of fees and reimbursement of
expenses shall be submitted by both Reed Smith and SHS&L to the Administrative
Agent and the Oversight Board on a monthly basis.

         During the course of the Bankruptcy Cases, SHS&L, as Debtors' counsel,
performed substantial services in connection with claims reconciliation and
resolution. Similarly, Reed Smith, as counsel to the Creditors' Committee,
performed substantial services in connection with the investigation and analysis
of Avoidance Actions as well as other causes of action held by the Debtors. In
the interest of efficiency and in an effort to avoid the unnecessary duplication
of effort, Reed Smith and SHS&L will divide their representation of the
Administrative Agent on these and other matters in the same manner.

         The Administrative Agent may, if/when necessary, retain R. Barry
Borden, who served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Debtors prior
to Confirmation, as a consultant at an hourly rate of $175.00. As is true with
all of the Administrative Agent's professionals, invoices for Mr. Borden's fees
and expenses must be submitted to the Administrative Agent and Oversight Board
on a monthly basis for review and approval.

                                    (D) CONSULTATION. The Administrative Agent
shall consult with the Oversight Board in good faith regarding all material
issues affecting the Debtors' Estates, including the resolution of Claims
objections and Avoidance Actions, and the disposition of Estate Property.
Additionally, the Administrative Agent shall seek the advice of the Oversight
Board regarding proposed budgets for the Estate, setting forth expected receipts
and disbursements for litigation, operations, and other appropriate purposes.

                                    (E) INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. Available Cash
and other Cash held pending distribution, including Cash held in reserve, shall
(to the extent permitted by applicable law) be invested by the Administrative
Agent in: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed or secured by,
the United States of America (including United States Treasury Bills); (ii)
obligations of any agency or corporation that is or may subsequently be created
by or pursuant to an Act of the United States Congress or its agencies or
instrumentalities; or (iii) demand deposits or short-term certificates of
deposit at any bank or trust company that has, at the time of the acquisition by
the Administrative Agent of such investments, capital stock and surplus
aggregating at least $100 million and whose short-term debt obligations are
rated by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in
one of the two highest categories. Such investments shall mature in the amounts
and at the times as, in the judgment of the Administrative Agent, are necessary,
or are desirable with a view to providing funds when needed to make payments
from the Estate Property. Any investment purchase with the Estate Property shall
be deemed a part of the Estate Property. All interest, distributions, dividends
and proceeds received by the Administrative Agent in connection with such
investments shall be a part of the Estate Property.


                                       20
<PAGE>

                                    (F) PRIVILEGES. Any attorney-client
privilege, work-product privilege, or other privilege or immunity attaching to
any documentation or communication shared with or transferred by the Debtors or
their professionals to the Administrative Agent or its professionals, shall not
be deemed waived and, to the extent the Debtors could claim a privilege or
immunity, shall automatically vest in the Administrative Agent.

                                    (G) COMPENSATION. The Administrative Agent
will be compensated on a monthly basis for the three months immediately
following the Effective Date. The Administrative Agent's monthly compensation
shall be based on an annual salary of $150,000. After the three month period has
expired, the Administrative Agent shall be compensated at $175 an hour, not to
exceed $2,625 per month, unless approved by the Oversight Board. In addition to
the aforementioned compensation, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled
to reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the
performance of its duties under the Plan.

                           (5) DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH. At the option of the
Administrative Agent, any Cash payment to be made hereunder may be made by check
or wire transfer or as otherwise required or provided in applicable agreements.

                           (6) DELIVERY OF DISTRIBUTIONS. Subject to Bankruptcy
Rule 9010, unless otherwise provided in the Plan, all distributions to any
holder of an Allowed Claim will be made to the holder of each Allowed Claim at
the address of such holder as listed in the Schedules, or on the books and
records of the Debtors or their agents unless the Debtors or the Administrative
Agent shall have been notified, in advance, in writing of a change of address,
including, without limitation, by the timely filing of a proof of claim or
interest by such holder that provides an address for such holder different from
the address reflected in the Schedules or in the Debtors' or Administrative
Agent's books and records. In the event that any distribution to any holder is
returned as undeliverable, no distribution to such holder will be made unless
and until the Administrative Agent has been notified of the then current address
of such holder, at which time or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter,
such distribution will be made to such holder without interest; provided,
however, that, such undeliverable distributions will be deemed unclaimed
property under Section 347(b) of the Bankruptcy Code at the expiration of 90
days after the date of distribution, the distribution shall irrevocably revert
to the Debtors' Estates and any Claim in respect of such distribution shall be
discharged and forever barred from assertion against the Debtors and their
Estates. The Administrative Agent will have no obligation to attempt to locate
any holder of an Allowed Claim other than by reviewing the Schedules and its
books and records (including any proofs of claim filed against the Debtors).

                  (b) DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH. At the option of the Administrative
Agent, any Cash payment to be made hereunder may be made by check or wire
transfer or as otherwise required or provided in applicable agreements.

                  (c) MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS. No payment of Cash less than $10
shall be made by the Administrative Agent, on account of the Debtors. Any Estate
Property that is not distributable in accordance with Section 5.5 of the Plan
shall be distributed to a charitable organization exempt from federal income tax
under Section 501(c)(3) of the Tax Code to be selected by the Administrative
Agent which shall in no way be related to the Debtors or the Administrative
Agent, as contemplated by Section 6.4 of the Plan.

                  (d) DATES OF DISTRIBUTION. Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, the first interim distribution to be made under the Plan shall be made
on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. In
the event that any payment or act under the Plan is required to be made or
performed on a date that is not a Business Day, then the making of such payment


                                       21
<PAGE>

or the performance of such act may be completed on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the next succeeding Business Day, but shall be deemed to have
been completed as of the required date. To the extent funds are available,
subsequent distributions will be made by the Administrative Agent on a quarterly
basis after the Effective Date until such time as all assets of the Debtors'
estates have been distributed in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

                  (e) DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS AS OF THE DISTRIBUTION RECORD
DATE. As of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date, the various
transfer registers for each of the Classes of Claims or Equity Interests as
maintained by the Debtors, or their agents, shall be deemed closed, and there
shall be no further changes in the record holders of any of the Claims or Equity
Interests. The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to recognize any
transfer of the Claims or Equity Interests occurring on or after the
Distribution Record Date. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recognize and deal for all purposes hereunder only with those record holders
stated on the transfer ledgers as of the close of business on the Distribution
Record Date, to the extent applicable.

                  (f) CLOSING OF THE CHAPTER 11 CASES. If at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that the expense of administering the Debtors'
Estates so as to make a final distribution to Allowed Claims is likely to exceed
the value of the assets remaining in the estate, the Administrative Agent shall
apply to the Bankruptcy Court for authority to (i) reserve any amounts necessary
to close the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) donate any balance to a charitable
organization exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Tax
Code that is unrelated to the Administrative Agent, any of the Debtors, or any
insider of any of the Debtors, to the knowledge of the Administrative Agent, and
(iii) close the Chapter 11 Cases in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and
Bankruptcy Rules. Notice of such application shall be given electronically, to
the extent practicable, to those parties who have filed requests for notices and
whose electronic addresses remain current and operating.

         H.       TREATMENT OF DISPUTED, CONTINGENT AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS

                  1.       Disputed Claims
                           ---------------

                           (a) NO DISTRIBUTION PENDING ALLOWANCE OF CLAIMS.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any portion of a Claim is a
Disputed Claim, no payment or distribution provided hereunder shall be made on
account of such Claim unless and until such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed
Claim.

                           (b) DISTRIBUTIONS UPON ALLOWANCE OF DISPUTED CLAIMS.
If, on or after the Effective Date, any Disputed Claim becomes, in whole or in
part, an Allowed Claim, the Debtor shall, no later than the fifteenth (15th)
Business Day of the first month following the month in which the Disputed Claim
becomes an Allowed Claim, distribute to the holder thereof the distributions, if
any, that such holder would have received had its Claim been Allowed on the
Effective Date, except as otherwise provided herein.

                           (c) DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF ALLOWED CLAIMS UPON
DISALLOWANCE OF DISPUTED CLAIMS. Subject to the Debtors' rights under Section
6.4 of the Plan, upon disallowance of any Disputed Claim, each holder of an
Allowed Claim in the same Class as the disallowed Disputed Claim will be
entitled to its Pro Rata Share of Cash equal to the distribution that would have
been made in accordance with Article IV of the Plan to the holder of such
Disputed Claim had such Disputed Claim been an Allowed Claim on or prior to the
Effective Date. Upon allowance or disallowance of all or any portion of such
Disputed Claims, the Administrative Agent will make appropriate distributions in
accordance with the Plan.

                  2.       Objections to and Resolution of Claims
                           --------------------------------------

                           (a) PROCEDUREs. Unless otherwise ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court after notice and a hearing, following the Effective Date, the
Administrative Agent, on account of the Debtors, shall have the right to the
exclusion of all others (except as to applications for allowances of
compensation and reimbursement of expenses under sections 330 and 503 of the
Bankruptcy Code) to make and file objections to Claims and shall serve a copy of
each objection upon the holder of the Claim to which the objection is made as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
Effective Date. From and after the Confirmation Date, all objections shall be
litigated to a Final Order except to the extent the Administrative Agent elects
to withdraw any such objection or the Administrative Agent and the holder of a
Claim elect to compromise, settle, or otherwise resolve any such objection, in
which event they may settle, compromise, or otherwise resolve any Disputed Claim
without approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to Section 6.7(d) of the
Plan, all settlements of Claims and Causes of Action in excess of $25,000 are
subject to approval by the Oversight Board. Notwithstanding any authority to the
contrary, an objection to a Claim shall be deemed properly served on the
claimant if the Administrative Agent effects service in any of the following
manners: (a) in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4, as modified
and made applicable by Bankruptcy Rule 7004; (b) to the extent counsel for a
claimant is unknown, by first class mail, postage prepaid, on the signatory on
the proof of claim or other representative identified in the proof of claim or
any attachment thereto; or (c) by first class mail, postage prepaid, on any
counsel that has appeared on the claimant's behalf in these Chapter 11 Cases.

                           (b) NO RECOURSE. Notwithstanding that the allowed
amount of any particular Disputed Claim is reconsidered under the applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules or is allowed in an
amount for which after application of the payment priorities established by this
Plan there is insufficient value to provide a recovery equal to that received by
other holders of Allowed Claims in the respective Class, no Claim holder shall
have recourse against the Administrative Agent, the Debtors, the Creditors'
Committee, or any of their respective professional consultants, agents,
attorneys, advisors, officers, directors or members or its successors or
assigns, or any of its respective property. However, nothing in the Plan shall
modify any right of a holder of a Claim under section 502(j) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

         I.       THE CREDITORS' COMMITTEE

         The Creditors' Committee will continue in its current form from and
after the Confirmation Date until the Effective Date, and will have all of the
rights, powers and duties set forth in the Bankruptcy Code. Except as otherwise
specifically provided under the Plan, on the Effective Date, the Creditors'
Committee will be dissolved and disbanded.

         J.       VESTING OF PROPERTY AND DISCHARGE OF CLAIMS

                  1.       Vesting of Property
                           -------------------

         As of the Effective Date, title to the property of the Estates shall
vest in the Debtors, subject to the Administrative Agent's obligation to
administer, liquidate, and distribute the property in accordance with the terms
of this Plan. As of the Effective Date, all assets of the Debtors shall be free
and clear of all Claims, except as provided in the Plan or the Confirmation
Order.


                                       23
<PAGE>

                  2.       Discharge of Claims and Debts and Termination of
                           ------------------------------------------------
                           Equity Interests
                           ----------------

         Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Confirmation
Order, the rights afforded in the Plan and the payments and distributions to be
made hereunder shall discharge all existing debts and Claims, and terminate all
Equity Interests of any kind, nature or description whatsoever against or in the
Debtors or any of their assets or properties to the fullest extent permitted by
section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code. Except as otherwise provided herein or in
the Confirmation Order, upon the Effective Date, all existing Claims against the
Debtors and Equity Interests in the Debtors, shall be, and shall be deemed to
be, discharged and terminated, and all holders of Claims and Equity Interests
shall be precluded and enjoined from asserting against the Debtors, or any of
their assets or properties, any other or further Claim or Equity Interest based
upon any act or omission, transaction or other activity of any kind or nature
that occurred prior to the Effective Date, whether or not such holder has filed
a proof of Claim or proof of Equity Interest.

         K.       EXCULPATION

         Neither the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, the Administrative
Agent, nor any of their respective members, officers, directors, employees,
advisors, professionals or agents, (collectively, "Exculpation Parties") shall
have or incur any liability to any holder of a Claim or Equity Interest for any
act or omission in connection with, related to, or arising out of the Chapter 11
Cases, negotiations regarding or concerning the Plan, the pursuit of
confirmation of the Plan, the consummation of the Plan, or the administration of
the Plan or the property to be distributed under the Plan, except for willful
misconduct or gross negligence, and, in all respects, the Exculpation Parties
shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel with respect to their
duties and responsibilities under the Plan.

         L.       EXECUTORY CONTRACTS

         On the Effective Date, all tariffed services being received by any of
the Debtors shall be deemed terminated and all executory contracts and unexpired
leases to which any of the Debtors is a party shall be deemed rejected as of the
Effective Date, except for an executory contract or unexpired lease that (i) has
been assumed or rejected pursuant to Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court entered
prior to the Effective Date or (ii) is the subject of a separate motion to
assume and assign or reject filed under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code by
the Debtors prior to the Effective Date. Termination of any such tariffed
services shall not be deemed or be construed to be a rejection of an executory
contract.

         APPROVAL OF REJECTION OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES.
Entry of the Confirmation Order shall constitute the approval, pursuant to
Section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, of the rejection of the executory
contracts and unexpired leases rejected as of the Effective Date pursuant to the
Plan.

         BAR DATE FOR FILING PROOFS OF CLAIM RELATING TO CERTAIN EXECUTORY
CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES REJECTED BY OPERATION OF THE PLAN. In the event
that the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease by the Debtors
pursuant to the Plan results in damages to the other party or parties to such
contract or lease, a Claim for such damages, if not heretofore evidenced by a
filed proof of claim, shall be forever barred and shall not be enforceable
against the Debtors or any property to be distributed under the Plan unless a
proof of claim is filed with the Bankruptcy Court and served upon the Debtors on
or before the date that is thirty (30) days after the Confirmation Date.

         M.       RETENTION OF JURISDICTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

         The Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction of all matters arising
under, arising out of, or related to the Chapter 11 Cases and the Plan pursuant
to, and for the purposes of, Sections 105(a) and 1142 of the Bankruptcy Code and
for, among other things, the following purposes: (a) to hear and determine


                                       24
<PAGE>

motions for the assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of executory
contracts or unexpired leases and the allowance of Claims resulting therefrom;
(b) to determine any motion, adversary proceeding, application, contested
matter, and other litigated matter pending on or commenced after the
Confirmation Date, including, without limitation, any proceeding to recover a
Cause of Action or Avoidance Action; (c) to issue orders as may be necessary to
ensure that distributions to holders of Allowed Claims are accomplished as
provided herein; (d) to consider Claims or the allowance, classification,
priority, compromise, estimation, or payment of any Claim; (e) to enter,
implement, or enforce such orders as may be appropriate in the event the
Confirmation Order is for any reason stayed, reversed, revoked, modified, or
vacated; (f) to issue injunctions, enter and implement other orders, and take
such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to restrain interference
by any person with the consummation, implementation, or enforcement of the Plan,
the Confirmation Order, or any other order of the Bankruptcy Court; (h) to hear
and determine any application to modify the Plan in accordance with Section 1127
of the Bankruptcy Code, to remedy any defect or omission or reconcile any
inconsistency in the Plan, the Disclosure Statement, or any order of the
Bankruptcy Court, including the Confirmation Order, in such a manner as may be
necessary to carry out the purposes and effects thereof; (i) to hear and
determine all applications under Sections 330, 331, and 503(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code for awards of compensation for services rendered and reimbursement of
expenses incurred prior to the Confirmation Date; (j) to hear and determine
disputes arising in connection with the interpretation, implementation, or
enforcement of the Plan, the Confirmation Order, any transactions or payments
contemplated hereby, or any agreement, instrument, or other document governing
or relating to any of the foregoing; (k) to take any action and issue such
orders as may be necessary to construe, enforce, implement, execute, and
consummate the Plan or to maintain the integrity of the Plan following
consummation; (l) to recover all assets of any of the Debtors property of any of
the Estates, wherever located; (m) to determine such other matters and for such
other purposes as may be provided in the Confirmation Order; (n) to hear and
determine matters concerning state, local, and federal taxes in accordance with
Sections 346, 505, and 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code (including, without
limitation, matters with respect to any taxes payable by a trust or reserve
established in furtherance of the Plan); (o) to hear and determine any other
matters related hereto and not inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code and title
28 of the United States Code; (p) to hear and determine all disputes arising
between the Administrative Agent and the Oversight Board; and (q) to enter a
final decree and close the Chapter 11 Cases.

         N.       CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLAN

                  1.       Conditions
                           ----------

         The following conditions must occur and be satisfied (either previously
or concurrently) for the Plan to become effective:

         (a) No stay of the Confirmation Order shall then be in effect; and

         (b) The Debtors shall have sufficient Cash to pay the sum of (i)
Allowed Administrative Expense Claims, Allowed Priority Tax Claims, and Allowed

professional fees and expenses that have not been paid, (ii) an amount that
would be required to distribute to the holders of Disputed Administrative
Expense Claims, Disputed Priority Tax Claims, and Disputed Priority Non-Tax
Claims if all such Claims are subsequently Allowed, as set forth more fully in
Article VII hereof, and (iii) an amount that would be required to satisfy all
the Debtors' costs and expenses in connection with the Debtors' obligations
under the Plan.

         (c) All other actions, documents, agreements and instruments necessary

<PAGE>

         O.       RELEASES

         In consideration of the efforts expended and to be expended by the
Debtors, the Creditors' Committee and the Administrative Agent, and former
officers and directors (other than those subject to potential Causes of Action
as described herein) in conjunction with their operational and financial
restructuring during the Chapter 11 Cases, on the Effective Date, the Debtors
will automatically release and will be deemed to release any and all Claims
(including any Claims arising out of any alleged fiduciary or other duty) that
it has or may have against the Administrative Agent and its professionals, the
Creditors' Committee and its professionals, the Debtors' professionals, and any
of the Debtors' officers and directors (other than those subject to potential
Causes of Action as described herein) who held such positions after the
Commencement Date in their capacities as such, arising or based upon any
actions, conduct or omissions occurring after the Commencement Date and prior to
the Effective Date, excluding willful misconduct and gross negligence (the
"Release Parties"). The Confirmation Order shall constitute an order approving
the compromise, settlement and release of any and all such claims pursuant to
Section 1123(b)(3)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. To the full extent permitted by
applicable Law, each holder of a Claim (whether or not Allowed) against or
Equity Interest in the Debtors shall be enjoined from commencing or continuing
any action, employment of process or act to collect, offset or recover and shall
be deemed to release any Claim against the Release Parties for actions occurring
prior to the Effective Date, excluding, however, willful misconduct and gross
negligence.

         P.       OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                  1.       Compliance with Tax Requirements on Distributions
                           -------------------------------------------------

         In connection with all distributions to be made to the holders of
Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests under the Plan, the Administrative
Agent will comply with all withholding and reporting requirements imposed by
federal, state and local taxing authorities and all such distributions under the
Plan will be subject to such withholding and reporting requirements.

                  2.       Amendment and Modification of the Plan
                           --------------------------------------

         The Plan may be amended, modified, or supplemented by the Debtors and
the Creditors' Committee, jointly, in the manner provided for by Section 1127 of
the Bankruptcy Code or as otherwise permitted by law without additional
disclosure pursuant to Section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code, except as the
Bankruptcy Court may otherwise direct. In addition, after the Confirmation Date,
so long as such action does not materially adversely affect the treatment of
holders of Claims or Equity Interests under the Plan, the Administrative Agent,
on account of the Debtors, may institute proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court to
remedy any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistencies in the Plan or
the Confirmation Order, with respect to such matters as may be necessary to
carry out the purposes and effects of the Plan. Prior to the Effective Date, the
Debtors and the Creditors' Committee, jointly, may make appropriate technical
adjustments and modifications to the Plan without further order or approval of
the Bankruptcy Court, PROVIDED that such technical adjustments and modifications
do not adversely affect in a material way the treatment of holders of Claims or
Equity Interests.

                  3.       Revocation and Withdrawal of Plan
                           ---------------------------------

         Each of the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee reserves the right to
revoke or withdraw the Plan at any time prior to the Confirmation Date. If the
Debtors or the Creditors' Committee take such action, the Plan shall be deemed
null and void. In such event, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver or release of any Claim by or against the Debtors or any
other person or to prejudice in any manner the rights of the Debtors or any
other person in any further proceedings involving the Debtors.

                  4.       Authority of Holder of Allowed Claims
                           -------------------------------------

         Each and every holder of an Allowed Claim that elects to participate in
distributions provided for under the Plan represents and warrants to the Debtors
and the Administrative Agent that such holder is authorized to accept, in
consideration of such Allowed Claim, the distributions provided for under the
Plan, and that there are no outstanding commitments, agreements or
understandings, express or implied, that may or will in any way defeat or modify
the rights conveyed or released or obligations undertaken under the Plan.

                  5.       Cram-Down Reservation
                           ---------------------

         IF ANY IMPAIRED CLASS VOTES TO ACCEPT THE PLAN BY THE REQUISITE
STATUTORY MAJORITIES PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 1126(C) AND 1126(D) OF THE BANKRUPTCY
CODE, AS APPLICABLE, OR IF ANY IMPAIRED CLASS IS DEEMED TO HAVE REJECTED THE
PLAN, THE DEBTORS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO UNDERTAKE TO HAVE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT
CONFIRM THE PLAN UNDER SECTION 1129(B) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND/OR AMEND THE
PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 13.10 OF THE PLAN TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
OBTAIN ENTRY OF A CONFIRMATION ORDER.

         Q.       RETENTION AND PRESERVATION OF CLAIM OBJECTIONS AND CAUSES OF
                  ACTION

         Pursuant to section 1123(b)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, upon entry of
the Confirmation Order, the Debtors' right to object to all Claims and Interests
asserted against them and all of the Debtors' Causes of Action, including
without limitation: (1) preference actions under to section 547 of the
Bankruptcy Code against those parties receiving payments from the Debtors within
ninety (90) days prior to the Petition Date, these potential preference
defendants are listed on EXHIBIT A to the Plan; (2) the Debtors' claim against
Stephen Hurley for amounts owed to the Debtors by Mr. Hurley under or related to
a December 15, 2000 Promissory Note and Restricted Stock Agreement; (3) claims
against other current or former employees of the Debtors for the collection of
unpaid employee loans, including but not limited to claims against the following
Stan Bielicki - $15,328, Dean McDavitt - $24,525, and Michael McClane - $42,039;
(4) claims against CBTEK, LLC; Choice One Communications of New York, Inc., US
LEC Corporation; and Robert L. Bast, Patricia B. Ayerle, William Bast, C.
Winston Balis, Jr., Peter G. Randall, Julia Randall Sharpe, Anne A. Strong and
Clarence Wurts; in each case in connection with the post-petition purchase and
sale of assets and/or provision of services by the Debtors; (5) any and all
claims of the Debtors against the Estate of AppliedTheory Corporation in
connection with the purchase by the Debtors of certain assets from it, and
related transactions; (6) any and all claims against Clear Blue Technologies,
Inc. and its affiliates in connection with transactions and events relating to
the purchase by the Debtors of certain assets of the Estate of AppliedTheory,
the collection of accounts related to the same, and services provided by the
Debtors to or for the benefit of Clear Blue Technologies, Inc. or its affiliates
or their customers; (7) any and all claims against Jeffrey Pasquale, Avi
Freedman, Elbert Basolis, Jr., and any other former stockholder of Netaxs, Inc.,
a New Jersey corporation, relating to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
by and among Fastnet Corporation, Fastnet Merger Corp., Netaxs, Inc., and such
shareholders, and the transactions and agreements related thereto; and (8) any
and all other Claims and Causes of Action that the Debtors hold preconfirmation,
including, but not limited to, Claims for unpaid accounts receivable and
fraudulent transfer, shall vest in the reorganized Debtors.

         Unless a Claim or Cause of Action against a Creditor or other entity is
expressly waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled in the Plan or
any Final Order, the Debtors expressly reserve such Claim or Cause of Action for
later adjudication by the Debtors (including without limitation, Claims and


                                       27
<PAGE>

Causes of Action not specifically identified or which the Debtors may presently
be unaware or which may arise or exist by reason of additional facts or
circumstances unknown to the Debtors at this time or facts or circumstances
which may change or be different from those which the Debtors now believe to
exist) and, therefore, no preclusion doctrine, including without limitation, the
doctrines of RES JUDICATA, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim
preclusion, waiver, estoppel (judicial, equitable or otherwise) or laches shall
apply to such Claims or Causes of Action upon or after the Confirmation or
Consummation of the Plan based on the Disclosure Statement, the Plan or the
Confirmation Order, except where such Claims or Causes of Action have been
released in the Plan or any other Final Order.

         The Debtors represent that, after a reasonable investigation, the
foregoing constitute all known causes of action.

VI.      PROJECTED DISTRIBUTION TO CREDITORS

         The Debtors and its professionals have conducted an analysis of all
claims scheduled by the Debtors. The estimated Allowed Claims and Allowed
Interests and projected distribution set forth in the table in Section II above
represent the best estimates of the Debtors and their professionals as to the
estimated allowed amounts of the various claims, based upon the information
available to them as of the date hereof. The Debtors have prepared a good faith
estimate based on these varying sources of information. The Debtors have
estimated administrative, priority unsecured and unsecured claims based on a
variety of information sources including its books and records, schedules and
statements, reports prepared by the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee and their
respective professionals, regarding claims filed with the Court, reports
prepared by the Debtors to estimate various claims, actual claims filed with the
Court and discussions with outside advisors.

         SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE
ESTIMATED INFORMATION SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE IN SECTION II HEREOF. ANTICIPATED
ALLOWED AMOUNTS OF ALLOWED CLAIMS AND ALLOWED INTERESTS AND THE PROJECTED
DISTRIBUTIONS SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE IN SECTION II HEREOF ARE SUBJECT, HOWEVER,
TO THE UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION THAT MAY OCCUR WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN CLAIMS
AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RESOLVED IN THE DEBTORS' FAVOR.
THEREFORE, NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF ALLOWED
CLAIMS AND ALLOWED INTERESTS AND THE PROJECTED DISTRIBUTION WILL BE ACHIEVED.

VII.     UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

         A.       INTRODUCTION

         The following discussion summarizes certain material United States
federal income tax ("Federal Income Tax") consequences of the Plan to certain
holders of Allowed Claims (the "Creditors") and the Debtors. This discussion
does not address the Federal Income Tax consequences to: (i) Creditors whose
claims are entitled to payment in full in cash, or are otherwise unimpaired
under the Plan; and (ii) holders of equity interests or claims that are
extinguished without a distribution. This discussion is based upon existing
provisions of the Tax Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder,
judicial authorities and current administrative rulings and practices now in
effect. No assurance can be given that future legislation, regulations,
administrative pronouncements and/or judicial decisions will not change
applicable law and affect the analysis described herein. Any such change could
be applied retroactively in a manner that would adversely affect the creditors
and the Debtors.


                                       28
<PAGE>

         The Federal Income Tax consequences of certain aspects of the Plan are
uncertain due to the lack of applicable legal authority and may be subject to
administrative or judicial interpretations that differ from the discussion
below. Counsel for the Debtors has not sought and will not seek any rulings from
the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") with respect to the Federal Income Tax
consequences discussed below. Although the discussion below represents the best
judgment as to the matters discussed herein, it does not in any way bind the IRS
or the courts or in any way constitute an assurance that the Federal Income Tax
consequences discussed herein will be accepted by the IRS or the courts.

         The following discussion does not address state, local or foreign tax
considerations that may be applicable to the Debtors or creditors and the
discussion does not address the tax consequences of the Plan to certain types of
creditors (including foreign persons, financial institutions, life insurance
companies, tax-exempt organizations and taxpayers who may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax) who may be subject to special rules not addressed
herein.

         THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF CERTAIN MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE
FOR CAREFUL TAX PLANNING AND ADVICE BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
PERTAINING TO A HOLDER OF AN ALLOWED CLAIM OR EQUITY INTEREST. THE DEBTORS ARE
NOT MAKING ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
CONFIRMATION AND CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBTORS OR THE
HOLDERS OF ANY CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS, NOR ARE THE DEBTORS RENDERING ANY
FORM OF LEGAL OPINION OR TAX ADVICE ON SUCH TAX CONSEQUENCES. ALL HOLDERS OF
CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH
RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR, THE TIMING, CHARACTER
AND AMOUNTS OF INCOME, GAIN, LOSS, DEDUCTION, CREDIT OR CREDIT RECAPTURE TO BE
RECOGNIZED, AND ANY PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS WITH WHICH THE HOLDER MUST COMPLY.

         B.       CERTAIN MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
                  TO THE DEBTORS

         The Debtors do not believe that there will be any material current cash
United States federal income tax consequences to the Debtors as a result of the
implementation of the Plan.

         C.       CERTAIN MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
                  TO HOLDERS OF CLAIMS

                  1.       GENERAL
                           -------

         The tax treatment of holders of claims and the character and amount of
income, gain or loss recognized as a consequence of the Plan and the
distributions provided for by the Plan will depend upon, among other things, (i)
whether the Claim (or any portion thereof) constitutes a Claim for principal or
interest; (ii) the type and classification of consideration received by the
holder in exchange for the Claim; (iii) whether the holder is a resident of the
United States for tax purposes (or falls into any special class of taxpayers,
such as those that are excluded from this discussion as noted above); (iv) the
manner in which a holder acquired a Claim; (v) the length of time the Claim has
been held; (vi) whether the claim was acquired at a discount; (vii) whether the
holder has taken a bad debt deduction with respect to the Claim (or any portion
thereof) in the current or prior years; (viii) whether the holder has previously
included accrued but unpaid interest with respect to the Claim; (ix) the method


                                       29
<PAGE>

of tax accounting of the holder; and (x) whether the claim is an installment
obligation for United States federal income tax purposes. Therefore, holders of
Claims should consult their tax advisors for information that may be relevant to
their particular situation and circumstances and the particular tax consequences
to them of the transactions contemplated by the Plan.

         A holder of a Claim should generally recognize a gain (or loss) to the
extent that the amount realized under the Plan in respect of the Claim exceeds
(or is exceeded by) the holder's tax basis in the Claim. The holder's amount
realized for this purpose will generally equal the amount of Cash the holder
receives under the Plan in respect of its Claim. The timing and amount of
income, gain or loss recognized as a consequence provided for by the Plan will
depend on, among other things, whether the holder of a Claim receives multiple
distributions pursuant to the Plan and whether the Debtors' obligation to make
such payments is treated as a new debt for United States federal income tax
purposes. Gain or loss may not currently be recognized if the property received
does not have an ascertainable fair market value.

                  2.       INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING
                           --------------------------------------------

         Certain payments, including the payments with respect to Claims
pursuant to the Plan, are generally subject to information reporting by the
payor (the Administrative Agent, on account of the Debtors) to the IRS.
Moreover, such reportable payments are subject to backup withholding under
certain circumstances. Under the Code's backup withholding rules, a holder of a
Claim may be subject to backup withholding with respect to distributions or
payments made pursuant to the Plan, unless the holder: (1) comes within certain
exempt categories (which generally include corporations) and, when required,
demonstrates this fact, or (2) provides a correct United States taxpayer
identification number and certifies under penalty of perjury that the taxpayer
identification number is correct and that the taxpayer is not subject to backup
withholding because of a failure to report all dividend and interest income.

         Holders of Claims that are non-United States Persons and that receive
payments or distributions under the Plan will not be subject to backup
withholding, provided that such holders furnish certification of their status as
non-United States Persons (and furnish any other required certification), or are
otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Generally, such certification is
provided on IRS Form W-8BEN.

         Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be credited against a holder's United States
federal income tax liability and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing an appropriate
claim for refund with the IRS (generally, a United States federal income tax
return).

         PERSONS CONCERNED WITH THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN SHOULD CONSULT
THEIR OWN ACCOUNTANTS, ATTORNEYS AND/OR ADVISORS. THE DEBTORS MAKE THE
ABOVE-NOTED DISCLOSURE OF POSSIBLE TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF
ALERTING READERS TO TAX ISSUES THEY MAY WISH TO CONSIDER.

VIII.    ALTERNATIVES TO THE PLAN

         The Debtors and Creditors' Committee have determined that the Plan is
the best means of providing maximum recoveries to creditors. Alternatives to the
Plan that have been considered and evaluated by the Debtors during the course of
these Chapter 11 Cases include (i) liquidation of the Debtors' assets under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) an alternative chapter 11 plan. The
Debtors' and the Creditors' Committee's thorough consideration of these
alternatives to the Plan has led it to conclude that the Plan, in comparison,
provides a greater recovery to creditors on a more expeditious timetable and in
a manner which minimizes inherent risks in any other course of action available
to the Debtors.


                                       30
<PAGE>

         A.       OTHER PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

         If the Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors or any other party in
interest (if the Debtors' exclusive period in which to file a chapter 11 plan
has expired) could attempt to formulate an alternative chapter 11 plan that
might provide for the liquidation of the Debtors' assets other than as provided
in the Plan. However, since substantially all of the Debtors' assets have
already been liquidated, the Debtors believe that any alternative chapter 11
plan will necessarily be substantially similar to the Plan. Any attempt to
formulate an alternative chapter 11 plan would necessarily delay creditors'
receipt of distributions yet to be made. Accordingly, the Debtors and the
Creditors' Committee believe that the Plan will enable all creditors entitled to
distributions to realize the greatest possible recovery on their respective
Claims with the least possible delay.

         B.       LIQUIDATION UNDER CHAPTER 7 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE

         If the Plan or any other chapter 11 plan for the Debtor cannot be
confirmed under section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 Cases may
be converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, in which event a
trustee would be elected or appointed to liquidate any remaining assets of the
Debtors for distribution to creditors pursuant to chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code. If a trustee is appointed and the remaining assets of the Debtors are
liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, all creditors holding Allowed
Administrative Expense Claims, Allowed Priority Tax Claims, and Allowed Priority
Non-Tax Claims may receive distributions of a lesser value on account of their
Allowed Claims and likely would have to wait a longer period of time to receive
such distributions than they would under the Plan. A chapter 7 trustee, who
would lack the Debtors' knowledge of their affairs, would be required to invest
substantial time and resources to investigate the facts underlying the multitude
of Claims filed against the Estates, and would be entitled to a fee based on a
percentage of recoveries to unsecured creditors, which expense is avoided under
the Plan.

IX.      CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENTS

         A.       THE CONFIRMATION HEARING

         The Bankruptcy Code requires the Bankruptcy Court, after notice, to
hold a confirmation hearing before a plan of reorganization may be confirmed.
The Confirmation Hearing to confirm the Plan has been scheduled for the date set
forth in the attached notice of confirmation hearing before the Honorable Thomas
M. Twardowski, United States Bankruptcy Judge in his Courtroom, United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Reading Division),
Madison Building, 400 Washington Street, Reading, Pennsylvania 19601. The
Confirmation Hearing may be adjourned from time to time by the Bankruptcy Court
without further notice except for an announcement of the adjourned date made at
the Confirmation Hearing. Any objection to confirmation must be made in writing
and specify in detail the name and address of the objector, all grounds for the
objection and the amount of the claim or number and type of shares of equity
security interests held by the objector. Any such objection must be filed with
the Bankruptcy Court and served so that it is received by the Bankruptcy Court
and certain other parties when and as set forth in the attached notice of
confirmation hearing.

         Objections to confirmation of the Plan are governed by Bankruptcy Rule
9014. At the hearing on the confirmation of the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court will
confirm the Plan only if the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly
those set forth in section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, have been satisfied.


                                       31
<PAGE>

B.       ACCEPTANCES NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THE PLAN

         At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court must determine, among
other things, whether the Plan has been accepted by the requisite amount and
number of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests in the impaired class, Class 2.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, a class of creditors or equity security holders is
impaired if its legal, equitable or contractual rights are altered by a proposed
plan of reorganization. If a class is not impaired, each creditor or equity
security holder in such unimpaired class is conclusively presumed to have
accepted the plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Class 1 is
not impaired under the Plan and is, therefore, not entitled to vote on the Plan.
Class 2 is the only impaired class under the Plan and holders of Allowed Claims
in such class are entitled to vote for or against the Plan by completing and
returning ballots mailed to them with this Disclosure Statement in the manner
set forth in the ballots. Class 3 and Class 4 are impaired under the Plan, but
are deemed to reject the Plan, and are not entitled to vote. An impaired class
of creditors and each holder of a claim in such class will be deemed to have
accepted the Plan if the holders of at least two-thirds in amount and more than
one-half of those in number of the Allowed Claims in such impaired class for
which complete and timely ballots have been received have voted for acceptance
of the Plan. An impaired class of equity securities and each holder of an
interest in such class will be deemed to have accepted a plan if the plan has
been accepted by at least two-thirds in amount of the interests in such class
who actually vote on the Plan.

         Because Class 3 and Class 4 are deemed to have rejected the Plan, the
Debtors cannot satisfy the requirements of section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy
Code as to those claims. Accordingly, the Debtors intend to seek confirmation of
the Plan pursuant to section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Under section
1129(b), the Bankruptcy Court must determine, among other things, that the Plan
does not discriminate unfairly and that it is fair and equitable with respect to
each class of impaired Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests that have not voted
to accept the Plan.

         C.       BEST INTERESTS OF CREDITORS

         The Bankruptcy Code requires that each holder of an impaired claim or
equity interest either (i) accepts the Plan, or (ii) receives or retains under
the Plan property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not less than
the value such holder would receive if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter
7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

         The first step in determining whether this test has been satisfied is
to determine the dollar amount that would be generated from the liquidation of
the Debtors' assets and properties in the context of a chapter 7 liquidation
case. The gross amount of cash that would be available for satisfaction of
claims and equity interests would be the sum consisting of the proceeds
resulting from the disposition of the unencumbered assets and properties of the
Debtors, augmented by the unencumbered cash hold by the Debtors at the time of
the commencement of the liquidation case.

         The next step is to reduce that gross amount by the costs and expenses
of liquidation and by such additional administrative and priority claims that
might result from the use of chapter 7 for the purposes of liquidation. Any
remaining net cash would be allocated to creditors and shareholders in strict
priority in accordance with section 726 of the Bankruptcy Code. Finally, the
present value of such allocations (taking into account the time necessary to
accomplish the liquidation) are compared to the value of the property that is
proposed to be distributed under the Plan on the Effective Date.


                                       32
<PAGE>

         The Debtors' costs of liquidation under chapter 7 would include the
fees payable to a trustee in bankruptcy, as well as those fees that might be
payable to attorneys and other professionals that such a trustee might engage.
Other liquidation costs include the expenses incurred during the Chapter 11
Cases allowed in the chapter 7 cases, such as compensation for attorneys,
financial advisors, appraisers, accountants, and other professionals for the
Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, and costs and expenses of members of the
Creditors' Committee, as well as other compensation claims.

         The foregoing types of claims, costs, expenses, fees, and such other
claims that may arise in a liquidation case would be paid in full from the
liquidation proceeds before the balance of those proceeds would be made
available to pay prepetition priority and unsecured Claims.

         The Debtors submit that each impaired Class will receive under the Plan
a recovery at least equal in value to the recovery such Class would receive
pursuant to a liquidation of the Debtors under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

         After consideration of the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would
have on the ultimate proceeds available for distribution to creditors in the
Chapter 11 Cases, including (i) the increased costs and expenses of a
liquidation under chapter 7 arising from fees payable to a trustee in bankruptcy
and professional advisors to such trustee, and (ii) the substantial increases in
claims that would be satisfied on a priority basis, the Debtors have determined
that confirmation of the Plan will provide each holder of an Allowed Claim with
a recovery that is not less than such holder would receive pursuant to
liquidation of the Debtors under chapter 7.

         The Debtors also believe that the value of any distributions to each
Class of Allowed Claims in a chapter 7 case would be less than the value of
distributions under the Plan because such distributions in a chapter 7 case
would not occur for a substantial period of time. In the event litigation was
necessary to resolve claims asserted in a chapter 7 case, the delay could be
prolonged and administrative expenses increased.

         D.       FEASIBILITY

         Section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a chapter 11
plan may be confirmed only if the Court finds that such plan is feasible. A
feasible plan is one which will not lead to a need for further reorganization or
liquidation of the debtor. Since the Plan provides for the liquidation of the
Debtors, the Court will find that the Plan is feasible if it determines that the
Debtors will be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Effective Date
and otherwise have sufficient funds to meet their post-Confirmation Date
obligations to pay for the costs of administering and fully consummating the
Plan and closing these Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors believe that the Plan
satisfies the financial feasibility requirement imposed by the Bankruptcy Code.

         E.       CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN

         In the event the Bankruptcy Court determines that all of the
requirements for the confirmation of the Plan are satisfied, the Bankruptcy
Court will issue the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan pursuant to section
1129 of the Bankruptcy Code.

X.       CERTAIN RISK FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED

         HOLDERS OF IMPAIRED CLAIMS AGAINST OR INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS ARE
ENCOURAGED TO READ AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, AS WELL
AS THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT (AND THE
DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TOGETHER HEREWITH AND/OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE), PRIOR
TO VOTING TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN. THOSE RISK FACTORS SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER,
BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING THE ONLY RISKS INVOLVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLAN
AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION.


                                       33
<PAGE>

         A.       PARTIES-IN-INTEREST MAY OBJECT TO THE DEBTORS' CLASSIFICATION
                  OF CLAIMS

         Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan of
reorganization may place a claim or an interest in a particular class only if
such claim or interest is substantially similar to the other claims or interests
of such class. The Debtors believe that the classification of claims and
interests under the Plan complies with the requirements set forth in the
Bankruptcy Code. However, the Debtors cannot give assurances that the Bankruptcy
Court will reach the same conclusion.

         B.       THE DEBTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN

         The Debtors cannot assure you that the requisite acceptances to confirm
the Plan will be received. Even if the requisite acceptances are received, the
Debtors cannot assure you that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan. A
non-accepting creditor or equity security holder of the Debtors might challenge
the balloting procedures and results as not being in compliance with the
Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rules. Even if the Bankruptcy Court determined
that the Disclosure Statement and the balloting procedures and results were
appropriate, the Bankruptcy Court could still decline to confirm the Plan if it
found that any of the statutory requirements for confirmation had not been met.
Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth the requirements for confirmation
and requires, among other things, a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the
confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by a liquidation or a need
for further financial reorganization and that the value of distributions to
non-accepting holders of claims and interests within a particular class under
the Plan will not be less than the value of distributions such holders would
receive if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.
While the Debtors cannot give assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will conclude
that these requirements have been met, the Debtors believe that the Plan will
not be followed by a need for further financial reorganization and that
non-accepting holders within each class under the Plan will receive
distributions at least as great as would be received following a liquidation
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code when taking into consideration all
administrative claims and the costs and uncertainty associated with any such
chapter 7 case.

         The confirmation and consummation of the Plan are also subject to
certain conditions. If the Plan is not confirmed, it is unclear whether a
restructuring of the Debtors could be implemented and what distribution holders
of Claims or Equity Interests ultimately would receive with respect to its
Claims or Equity Interests. If an alternative reorganization could not be agreed
to, it is possible that the Debtors would have to liquidate their assets, in
which case it is likely that holders of Claims or Equity Interests would receive
substantially less favorable treatment than they would receive under the Plan.

         C.       THE DEBTORS MAY OBJECT TO THE AMOUNT OR CLASSIFICATION OF YOUR
                  CLAIM

         The Debtors reserve, for the Administrative Agent, the right to object
to the amount or classification of any Claim or Interest. The estimates set
forth in this Disclosure Statement cannot be relied on by any creditor whose
Claim or Interest is subject to an objection. Any such Claim or Interest holder
may not receive its specified share of the estimated distributions described in
this Disclosure Statement.

XII.     CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

         The Debtors believes that confirmation and implementation of the Plan
is preferable to any of the alternatives described above because it will provide
the greatest recoveries to holders of Claims. The Debtors urge holders of Claims
entitled to vote on the Plan to vote to accept the Plan.
