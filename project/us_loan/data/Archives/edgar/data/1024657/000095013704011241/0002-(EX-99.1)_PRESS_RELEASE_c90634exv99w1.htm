<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities
laws. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as &#147;will,&#148; &#147;expects,&#148;
&#147;plans,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;continue,&#148; or the negative of such terms, or other
comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or
relating to any of the foregoing statements. For example, statements of expected 2005 revenue, net
income, margins, cash flows and capital expenditures are all forward-looking statements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Our actual results could differ materially from the expectations expressed in these statements.
Factors that could cause our results to differ include: we face risks in connection with completed
or potential acquisitions; we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our
activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business; we
cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive
industries; our operating results may be harmed if we are unable to maximize our call center
utilization; increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in
such services could seriously harm our business; we must continue to attract and retain a
sufficient number of qualified employees; the financial results of our receivables management
segment depends on our ability to purchase charged-off receivable portfolios on acceptable terms
and in sufficient amounts; because of the length of time involved in collecting charged-off
consumer receivables on acquired portfolios and the volatility in the timing of our collections, we
may not be able to identify trends and make changes in our portfolio purchasing strategies in a
timely manner, as well as the other risks that are described from time to time in our SEC reports
(including but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003,
and subsequently filed reports). We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking
statements.
