ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 23, 2004, Far East Energy Corporation (the "Registrant")
entered into Amended and Restated Employment Agreements (the "Employment
Agreements") with Michael R. McElwrath, Chief Executive Officer and Bruce N.
Huff, Chief Financial Officer (each, an "Executive").

         The Employment Agreements provide that the Executive will receive (i)
an annual base salary of not less than $236,250 in the case of Mr. McElwrath and
$168,000 in the case of Mr. Huff and (ii) performance bonuses of (A) not less
than $20,000 payable on or before the 13th of April and October of each year in
the case of Mr. McElwrath and (B) between 15% to 25% of his base salary in the
case of Mr. Huff. The performance criteria for bonuses will be established by
the Compensation Committee of the Registrant (or its Board of Directors if the
Registrant does not have a Compensation Committee).

         Unless extended, the Employment Agreements for Messrs. McElwrath and
Huff terminate on October 13, 2008 and May 1, 2009, respectively. The Employment
Agreements provide that if an Executive is terminated by the Registrant for
Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreements), the Registrant shall pay his
base salary and all amounts actually earned, accrued or owing as of the date of
termination and the Executive shall be entitled to exercise all options granted
to him under his Employment Agreement or otherwise to the extent vested and
exercisable on the date of termination.

         If an Executive's employment is terminated by the Registrant (other
than as a result of death, Disability (as defined in his Employment Agreement)
or Cause), or if the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (as
defined in his Employment Agreement), the Executive shall be entitled to the
following:

         - a lump sum payment of two times the sum of Executive's base salary
and bonus paid during the immediately preceding twelve month period;

         - continued participation in all employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements available to the Registrant's executive officers in which Executive
was participating on the date of termination for a specified period of time
following termination; and

         - the exercise of all options and restricted stock awards granted to
him to the extent vested and exercisable at the date of termination of
Executive's employment, provided, that if the date of termination of Executive's
employment is on or before April 13, 2006 in the case of Mr. McElwrath and May
1, 2006 in the case of Mr. Huff, then all options and restricted stock granted
to him and exercisable within the first anniversary of the date of termination
in the case of Mr. McElwrath and within 30 months of the date of termination in
the case of Mr. Huff, shall be immediately and fully vested as of the date of
termination.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Executive's termination of
employment by the Registrant (other than for Cause, Disability or death) or by
the Executive for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreements) occurs
within 24 months following a Change of Control (as defined in the Employment
Agreements), then the Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment of three
times the sum of Executive's base salary and bonus during the immediately
preceding twelve-month period and all options and restricted stock granted to
Executive will immediately vest and become exercisable as of the date of
termination. The Employment Agreements also entitles each Executive to certain
gross up payments for excise taxes in the event of a Change of Control.

         In connection with the Employment Agreements, the Registrant amended
and restated its three stock option agreements with Messrs. McElwrath and Huff,
in order to make the option agreements consistent with the terms of the
Employment Agreements. The stock option agreements affected include:

                                       2
<PAGE>

         -        A non-qualified stock option award granted to Mr. McElwrath
                  with respect to 1,200,000 options to purchase the Registrant's
                  common stock at an exercise price of $0.65 per share;

         -        A stock option agreement granted to Mr. McElwrath with respect
                  to 100,000 shares of the Registrant's common stock at an
                  exercise of $0.65 per share; and

         -        A stock option agreement granted to Mr. Huff with respect to
                  500,000 shares of the Registrant's common stock at an exercise
                  price of $2.00 per share.

         The amendments to those stock option agreements did not change the
vesting and exercise price provisions of the original option agreements. The
stock option agreements provide that the shares of common stock subject to such
options vest 20% on the Award Date (as defined therein) and vest 20% on each
succeeding anniversary of the Award Date.

         The Registrant also entered into four stock option agreements with
executive officers on December 23, 2004, the terms of which are described in
Item 3.02 below and incorporated by reference herein.

         The above discussion of the Employment Agreements and the amended and
restated stock option agreements is a summary description of certain terms and
conditions of those agreements and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and
conditions of those agreements. For complete descriptions of the rights and
obligations summarized in this report, reference must be made to the Employment
Agreements, the amended and restated stock option agreements and stock option
agreements attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.9 and incorporated by
reference herein.

ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         On December 23, 2004 (the "Award Date"), the Registrant granted options
to purchase shares of the Registrant's common stock at an exercise price of
$2.00 per share to four executive officers and one employee of the Company. The
options vest 20% on the Award Date and 20% on each succeeding anniversary of the
Award Date.
