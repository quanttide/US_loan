ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 17, 2004, we entered into a second amendment to the
farmout agreements with Phillips China Inc. for each of the Qinnan block and
Shouyang block production sharing contracts in the Shanxi Province in China. The
amendments to these agreements include the following:

         o  Provide for an extension of time to complete phase one to January
            31, 2005 and phase two to December 31, 2005;

         o  Modify the work program in phase two to consist of drilling two
            horizontal wells, employing our best commercial effort to drill each
            well to 4,000 meters of horizontal drilling in coal seam with a
            minimum requirement of 2,000 meters drilled in coal seam for each
            well, and in phase three to consist of drilling one horizontal well,
            attempting to drill to 4,000 meters of horizontal drilling in coal
            seam. Our total work commitment for phase two and phase three, if we
            elect to extend into those phases, consists of a combined total of
            12,000 meters of horizontal drilling in coal seam for the three
            wells combined; and

         o  Amend the performance guarantee requirement in phase two, if we
            elect to continue into phase two, to provide that the $1,000,000
            escrow account shall continue to be held until December 31, 2005. In
            the event that we have not completed the drilling of the first
            horizontal well under phase two by June 30, 2005, we will be
            required to increase the escrow account to $2,600,000. In the event
            that we do extend into the second phase of the exploration period,
            notwithstanding the requirement to increase the amount of the escrow
            account to $2,600,000 on June 30, 2005, subject to certain events
            described above, we shall have the right, each time subject to the
            prior written consent of Phillips China, Inc., to drawdown amounts
            required to fund operations in the second phase after June 30, 2005.
            Each such drawdown shall not exceed $250,000.

         The above discussion of the second amendments is a summary description
of certain terms and conditions of those agreements and is qualified in its
entirety by the terms and conditions of those agreements. For complete
descriptions of the rights and obligations summarized in this report, reference
must be made to the second amendments attached hereto as Exhibits 10.01 and
10.02 and incorporated by reference hereto.
