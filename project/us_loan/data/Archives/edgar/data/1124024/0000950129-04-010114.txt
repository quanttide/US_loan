ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 21, 2004, Far East Energy Corporation (the "Registrant")
entered into a Stock Subscription Agreement (the "Agreement") with certain
investors located outside the United States (the "Purchasers") and Tim Whyte, as
representative (the "Representative"). Under the Agreement, the Purchasers
subscribed for 6,406,250 units of the Registrant (the "Units"). The gross
proceeds the Registrant received from the sale of the Units at the closing were
$10,250,000. Each Unit is comprised of two shares of the Registrant's common
stock, $0.001 par value ("Common Stock") and one warrant to purchase one share
of Common Stock ("Warrant"). In connection with the Agreement, the Registrant
also granted the Purchasers registration rights in connection with the shares of
Common Stock underlying the Units and the Warrants. The Registrant is not
obligated to file a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock
underlying the Units and the Warrants prior to April 30, 2005.

         Pursuant to the Agreement, the Registrant, the Purchasers and the
Representative agreed to the following:

         1. Subject to the approval of the Registrant's Nomination and Corporate
Governance Committee, within 30 days of the Closing (as defined in the
Agreement), the Registrant has agreed to appoint Tim Whyte to the Registrant's
Board of Directors to serve until the next meeting of the Registrant's
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors of the Registrant. The
Registrant has also agreed to nominate the Representative or such other person
designated by the Representative (the "Purchaser Designee") to the Registrant's
Board of Directors for election by the stockholders of the Registrant at each
meeting of the Registrant's stockholders called for the purpose of electing
directors of the Registrant, provided that at the time of such appointment and
nomination (a) the Purchasers, in the aggregate, beneficially own at least 10%
of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, and (b) the Purchaser Designee
is satisfactory to the Registrant's Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committee.

         2. For a period of 18 months from the date of the Agreement, if the
Registrant determines to pursue an offering of debt or equity securities
("Offered Securities") in a capital raising transaction (a "Proposed Offering"),
the Registrant is required to notify the Representative of the Proposed Offering
and the Representative shall have the exclusive right, for a period of 45 days
from receipt of notice of the Proposed Offering, to consummate the purchase of
all or a part of the Offered Securities by one or more of the Purchasers or
syndicate of investors arranged by the Representative. The Registrant's Board of
Directors shall review and consider in good faith the proposal by the
Representative and make a determination as to whether to approve such proposal,
which determination shall consider whether the terms of, and all fees that may
be incurred by the Registrant in connection with, the issuance and sale of the
securities are customary for a transaction of this nature. If the Representative
fails to submit, fails to close or the Registrant's Board of Directors fails to
approve the proposal by the Representative on or before the expiration of the 45
day period, then the Registrant may offer and sell the securities to one or more
third parties upon similar terms specified in the Registrant's notice of the
Proposed Offering without any obligation to submit another notice to the
Representative. The Registrant's obligations are subject to certain exceptions
and limitations relating to specified private placements and other matters
described in the Agreement.

                                       2
<PAGE>
         3. The Registrant has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to list or include the Common Stock on a recognized stock exchange, such as The
Nasdaq National Market, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or AIM, on or before June
30, 2005, and will consult with the Representative regarding an appropriate
choice of an exchange.

         4. For a period of 18 months from the date of the Agreement, the
Registrant granted each Purchaser the right to purchase a pro rata share of
securities sold by the Registrant in a capital raising transaction. This right
will not arise in connection with (a) securities issued pursuant to the
acquisition of another business entity or business segment of any such entity by
the Registrant by merger, consolidation, conversion, purchase of substantially
all the assets or other reorganization, (b) securities issued upon conversion of
convertible notes or securities, upon exercise of warrants, options or other
rights to acquire securities or as dividends, stock splits or distributions and
(c) securities issued pursuant to specified private placements.

         5. The Registrant agreed to consult with the Representative and
consider in good faith, any proposal from any person with whom Representative
has a relationship and who is qualified and experienced in the construction of
oil and gas drilling rigs in the People's Republic of China, relating to any
joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement or undertaking providing for
the manufacture, production or construction of drilling rigs for the drilling of
coalbed methane gas with respect to the Registrant's holdings and rights in the
People's Republic of China. These obligations are subject to (a) the receipt by
the Registrant and each other person party to such agreement, arrangement or
undertaking receiving all permits, concessions and licenses required or
necessary to participate in the construction of such rigs, (b) the approval of
such agreement, arrangement or undertaking and the contractor by all partners
and venturers of the Registrant in the exploration and production of coalbed
methane gas with respect to China, including, without limitation, ConocoPhillips
and China United Coalbed Methane Company and (c) the approval of such agreement,
arrangement or undertaking by the Registrant's Board of Directors. The
Registrant and its subsidiaries also agreed not to enter into any venture
relating to the manufacture, production or construction of any drilling rigs for
the use of third parties for the drilling of coalbed methane gas in China. The
Purchasers and its subsidiaries agreed not to enter into a commercial joint
venture relating to the construction of any drilling rigs for the use of third
parties for the drilling of coalbed methane gas in China. The Registrant is not,
however, prohibited or restricted from negotiating, discussing or entering into
a lease, rental or service arrangement or similar undertaking with any third
party relating to provision and operation of any rig for the drilling of coalbed
methane gas with respect to China. All rights and obligations described in this
paragraph will commence upon the six month anniversary of the date of the
Agreement and shall expire upon the second anniversary of the date of the
Agreement.

         The above discussion of the Agreement is a summary description of
certain terms and conditions of the Agreement and is qualified in its entirety
by the terms and conditions of the Agreement. For complete descriptions of the
rights and obligations summarized in this report, reference must be made to the
Agreement.

ITEM 3.02         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         As described in Item 1.01 above, on December 21, 2004, the Purchasers
subscribed for 6,406,250 Units. The gross proceeds the Registrant received from
the sale of the Units at the closing

                                       3
<PAGE>
were $10,250,000. Each Warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of
Common Stock at a price of $2.50 per share. Each Warrant expires three years
from the date of its issuance. In connection with the closing of the sale of the
Units, the Registrant will pay commissions of $820,000 and will issue placement
agent warrants to purchase 1,537,500 shares of Common Stock with a term of two
years and an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The Registrant intends to use
the proceeds of the offering to finance a portion of the Registrant's operations
in China, including planned horizontal drilling for coalbed methane in China in
2005 and for working capital purposes.

         Certain investors have been granted specified price protection rights
in connection with the sale of Common Stock in previous private placements
("Existing Investors"). Upon the closing of the sale to the Purchasers, the
Existing Investors will have a right to exercise price protection rights. If the
Existing Investors exercise these rights in connection with the sale of the
Units, then the Existing Investors would receive an aggregate of 337,500 shares
of Common Stock and Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 843,750 shares of
Common Stock. As a condition to the Company's issuance of Warrants to purchase
687,500 shares of Common Stock in connection with any exercise of these rights,
certain Existing Investors would be required to surrender warrants to purchase
550,000 shares of Common Stock at $2.50 per share that they currently hold.

         The securities discussed above were offered and sold to investors in a
private placement transaction made in reliance upon exemption from registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Act pursuant to Regulation S promulgated
thereunder. The Units were not offered or sold in the United States and the
Purchasers represented to the Registrant that they are not "U.S. Persons" (as
such term is defined in Regulation S).

         Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by the
Registrant dated December 27, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference.

             FAR EAST ENERGY ANNOUNCES THE CLOSING OF $10.25 MILLION
                      EQUITY FINANCING FOR CHINA OPERATIONS

HOUSTON, TX, DECEMBER 27, 2004 - FAR EAST ENERGY CORPORATION (OTC BB: FEEC)
announced today that it has received total gross proceeds of $10.25 million in a
private placement of shares of its common stock with investors located outside
the United States. The Company intends to use the proceeds to finance a portion
of its operations in China, including planned horizontal drilling for coalbed
methane in 2005, and for working capital purposes.

The Company issued, at a price of $1.60 per unit, a total of 6,406,250 units.
Each unit consisted of two shares of common stock and one warrant with a term of
three years and an exercise price of $2.50 per share, for a total of 12,812,500
shares of common stock and 6,406,250 warrants. The Company will pay commissions
of $820,000 and will issue placement agent warrants to purchase 1,537,500 shares
of common stock in connection with this transaction.

The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or
under any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered
or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an
offer, offer to sell, or solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any
jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Based in Houston, Texas, with offices in Beijing and Kunming, China, Far East
Energy is focused on the acquisition of, and exploration for, coalbed methane
through its agreements with ConocoPhillips and China United Coalbed Methane
Company (CUCBM).

Statements contained in this press release that state the intentions, hopes,
beliefs, anticipations, expectations or predictions of the future of Far East
Energy Corporation and its management are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1993, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. It is important to note
that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected in such forward-looking statements include: our lack of operating
history; limited and potentially inadequate cash resources; risk and
uncertainties associated with exploration, development and production of oil and
gas; expropriation and other risks associated with foreign operations; matters
affecting the oil and gas industry generally; lack of availability of oil and
gas field goods and services; environmental risks; drilling and production
risks; changes in laws or regulations affecting our operations, as well as other
risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB and subsequent filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
