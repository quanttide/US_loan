ITEM 3.02     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         On December 1, 2004, we sold 250,000 shares of our common stock, $0.001
par value ("Common Stock"), in a private placement to an accredited investor
(the "Purchaser") with gross proceeds of $250,000. No commission was paid on the
sale of the Common Stock to the Purchaser.

         Bathgate Capital Partners LLC (the "Placement Agent") is serving as our
placement agent in a private placement of units (the "Bathgate Placement"),
which is subject to our acceptance of subscriptions of at least $1.5 million
(the "Minimum Amount") prior to its closing. Each unit will consist of five
shares of our Common Stock and one warrant (a "Warrant") to purchase one share
of our Common Stock ("Units"). Each Warrant entitles its holder to purchase one
share of our Common Stock at a price of $1.50 per share and has a three year
term from the date of its issuance. Proceeds from the Units will be placed in an
escrow account until the Minimum Amount is received. The closing of the Bathgate
Placement will occur following the receipt of the Minimum Amount in escrow. As
of December 17, 2004, aggregate proceeds of $815,000 relating to 203,750 Units
have been received in the escrow. Upon closing of the private placement, we will
also sell to the Placement Agent, for a total of $100, warrants to purchase
shares of our Common Stock on the basis of forty warrants exercisable at $0.80
per share and eight warrants exercisable at $1.50 per share for each one hundred
Units sold in the Bathgate Placement. Any warrants sold to the Placement Agent
will have a five year term. Additionally, at the closing of the Bathgate
Placement, we will pay the Placement Agent a fee equal to 8% of the gross
proceeds from the sale of the Units. No Units or any underlying securities will
be issued until the closing of the Bathgate Placement. If the Minimum Amount is
not received, then the proceeds in the escrow will be returned to the
subscribers of the Units. No commissions will be payable to the Placement Agent
if the Minimum Amount is not received. We cannot make any assurances that the
Minimum Amount will be received.

         In connection with the sale of our Common Stock to the Purchaser, we
agreed to provide certain price protection rights to the Purchaser in the event
we sell shares of our Common Stock in a capital raising transaction to any other
investor on or before January 30, 2005 on pricing terms more favorable than
those given to Purchaser. If the Bathgate Placement is consummated, the
Purchaser will receive both 62,500 shares of our Common Stock and Warrants to
purchase 62,500 shares of our Common Stock as a result of these price protection
rights. In addition, certain previous investors have been granted specified
price protection rights in connection with the sale of our Common Stock in a
private placement. As a result of the sale of our Common Stock to the Purchaser,
these investors will receive 550,000 shares of our Common Stock. If the Bathgate
Placement is consummated, these investors may elect to receive 275,000 shares of
our Common Stock, in addition to the shares issued as a result of the sale of
our Common Stock to the Purchaser, and will exchange the 550,000 warrants to
purchase one share of our Common Stock at $2.50 per share that they currently
hold for Warrants to purchase 275,000 shares of our Common Stock as a result of
this price protection.

         The proceeds of these offerings will be used to finance our operations
in exploration for coalbed methane, our production sharing contracts in China
and working capital purposes.

         The securities discussed above were offered and sold or are being
offered and will be sold to investors in a private placement transaction made in
reliance upon exemption from registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), pursuant to Rule 506 of
Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Each of the investors is an accredited
investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act.
