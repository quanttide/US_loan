ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 21, 2004, Far East Energy Corporation (the "Registrant")
entered into a Stock Subscription Agreement (the "Agreement") with certain
investors located outside the United States (the "Purchasers") and Tim Whyte, as
representative (the "Representative"). Under the Agreement, the Purchasers
subscribed for 6,406,250 units of the Registrant (the "Units"). The gross
proceeds the Registrant received from the sale of the Units at the closing were
$10,250,000. Each Unit is comprised of two shares of the Registrant's common
stock, $0.001 par value ("Common Stock") and one warrant to purchase one share
of Common Stock ("Warrant"). In connection with the Agreement, the Registrant
also granted the Purchasers registration rights in connection with the shares of
Common Stock underlying the Units and the Warrants. The Registrant is not
obligated to file a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock
underlying the Units and the Warrants prior to April 30, 2005.

         Pursuant to the Agreement, the Registrant, the Purchasers and the
Representative agreed to the following:

         1. Subject to the approval of the Registrant's Nomination and Corporate
Governance Committee, within 30 days of the Closing (as defined in the
Agreement), the Registrant has agreed to appoint Tim Whyte to the Registrant's
Board of Directors to serve until the next meeting of the Registrant's
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors of the Registrant. The
Registrant has also agreed to nominate the Representative or such other person
designated by the Representative (the "Purchaser Designee") to the Registrant's
Board of Directors for election by the stockholders of the Registrant at each
meeting of the Registrant's stockholders called for the purpose of electing
directors of the Registrant, provided that at the time of such appointment and
nomination (a) the Purchasers, in the aggregate, beneficially own at least 10%
of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, and (b) the Purchaser Designee
is satisfactory to the Registrant's Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committee.

         2. For a period of 18 months from the date of the Agreement, if the
Registrant determines to pursue an offering of debt or equity securities
("Offered Securities") in a capital raising transaction (a "Proposed Offering"),
the Registrant is required to notify the Representative of the Proposed Offering
and the Representative shall have the exclusive right, for a period of 45 days
from receipt of notice of the Proposed Offering, to consummate the purchase of
all or a part of the Offered Securities by one or more of the Purchasers or
syndicate of investors arranged by the Representative. The Registrant's Board of
Directors shall review and consider in good faith the proposal by the
Representative and make a determination as to whether to approve such proposal,
which determination shall consider whether the terms of, and all fees that may
be incurred by the Registrant in connection with, the issuance and sale of the
securities are customary for a transaction of this nature. If the Representative
fails to submit, fails to close or the Registrant's Board of Directors fails to
approve the proposal by the Representative on or before the expiration of the 45
day period, then the Registrant may offer and sell the securities to one or more
third parties upon similar terms specified in the Registrant's notice of the
Proposed Offering without any obligation to submit another notice to the
Representative. The Registrant's obligations are subject to certain exceptions
and limitations relating to specified private placements and other matters
described in the Agreement.

                                       2

         3. The Registrant has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to list or include the Common Stock on a recognized stock exchange, such as The
Nasdaq National Market, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or AIM, on or before June
30, 2005, and will consult with the Representative regarding an appropriate
choice of an exchange.

         4. For a period of 18 months from the date of the Agreement, the
Registrant granted each Purchaser the right to purchase a pro rata share of
securities sold by the Registrant in a capital raising transaction. This right
will not arise in connection with (a) securities issued pursuant to the
acquisition of another business entity or business segment of any such entity by
the Registrant by merger, consolidation, conversion, purchase of substantially
all the assets or other reorganization, (b) securities issued upon conversion of
convertible notes or securities, upon exercise of warrants, options or other
rights to acquire securities or as dividends, stock splits or distributions and
(c) securities issued pursuant to specified private placements.

         5. The Registrant agreed to consult with the Representative and
consider in good faith, any proposal from any person with whom Representative
has a relationship and who is qualified and experienced in the construction of
oil and gas drilling rigs in the People's Republic of China, relating to any
joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement or undertaking providing for
the manufacture, production or construction of drilling rigs for the drilling of
coalbed methane gas with respect to the Registrant's holdings and rights in the
People's Republic of China. These obligations are subject to (a) the receipt by
the Registrant and each other person party to such agreement, arrangement or
undertaking receiving all permits, concessions and licenses required or
necessary to participate in the construction of such rigs, (b) the approval of
such agreement, arrangement or undertaking and the contractor by all partners
and venturers of the Registrant in the exploration and production of coalbed
methane gas with respect to China, including, without limitation, ConocoPhillips
and China United Coalbed Methane Company and (c) the approval of such agreement,
arrangement or undertaking by the Registrant's Board of Directors. The
Registrant and its subsidiaries also agreed not to enter into any venture
relating to the manufacture, production or construction of any drilling rigs for
the use of third parties for the drilling of coalbed methane gas in China. The
Purchasers and its subsidiaries agreed not to enter into a commercial joint
venture relating to the construction of any drilling rigs for the use of third
parties for the drilling of coalbed methane gas in China. The Registrant is not,
however, prohibited or restricted from negotiating, discussing or entering into
a lease, rental or service arrangement or similar undertaking with any third
party relating to provision and operation of any rig for the drilling of coalbed
methane gas with respect to China. All rights and obligations described in this
paragraph will commence upon the six month anniversary of the date of the
Agreement and shall expire upon the second anniversary of the date of the
Agreement.

         The above discussion of the Agreement is a summary description of
certain terms and conditions of the Agreement and is qualified in its entirety
by the terms and conditions of the Agreement. For complete descriptions of the
rights and obligations summarized in this report, reference must be made to the
Agreement.

ITEM 3.02         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         As described in Item 1.01 above, on December 21, 2004, the Purchasers
subscribed for 6,406,250 Units. The gross proceeds the Registrant received from
the sale of the Units at the closing

                                       3
<PAGE>
were $10,250,000. Each Warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of
Common Stock at a price of $2.50 per share. Each Warrant expires three years
from the date of its issuance. In connection with the closing of the sale of the
Units, the Registrant will pay commissions of $820,000 and will issue placement
agent warrants to purchase 1,537,500 shares of Common Stock with a term of two
years and an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The Registrant intends to use
the proceeds of the offering to finance a portion of the Registrant's operations
in China, including planned horizontal drilling for coalbed methane in China in
2005 and for working capital purposes.

         Certain investors have been granted specified price protection rights
in connection with the sale of Common Stock in previous private placements
("Existing Investors"). Upon the closing of the sale to the Purchasers, the
Existing Investors will have a right to exercise price protection rights. If the
Existing Investors exercise these rights in connection with the sale of the
Units, then the Existing Investors would receive an aggregate of 337,500 shares
of Common Stock and Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 843,750 shares of
Common Stock. As a condition to the Company's issuance of Warrants to purchase
687,500 shares of Common Stock in connection with any exercise of these rights,
certain Existing Investors would be required to surrender warrants to purchase
550,000 shares of Common Stock at $2.50 per share that they currently hold.

         The securities discussed above were offered and sold to investors in a
private placement transaction made in reliance upon exemption from registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Act pursuant to Regulation S promulgated
thereunder. The Units were not offered or sold in the United States and the
Purchasers represented to the Registrant that they are not "U.S. Persons" (as
such term is defined in Regulation S).

         Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by the
