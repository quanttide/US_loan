Section 2 - Financial Information
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On December 20, 2004, the Company converted its remaining financial assets to
cash. The conversion was undertaken in connection with a proposed reverse
acquisition of Toolbuilders Laboratories, Inc. (see Item 8.01). As a result of
the conversion, the Company now has $1,650,570 in cash and approximately $540 in
liabilities. The cash will be applied to the business of Toolbuilders
Laboratories, Inc. if the reverse acquisition is closed.

The financial assets of the company consisted of three notes receivable. The
aggregate principal balance on the three notes was $1,481,297.84 and the notes
were converted at the remaining balance due as of the date of conversion. The
Board of Directors considered the terms of the notes, the remaining principal
balances due, and payment histories of the borrowers and determined that the
value of the financial instruments were the balances owed. The Board of
Directors considered the price paid to be fair in the circumstances. The assets
were purchased by John R. Coghlan, an officer, director, and controlling
shareholder of Temporary Financial Services, Inc. The full purchase price for
the assets was paid in cash on the date of conversion.

The conversion of the financial assets to cash was considered a necessary step
to facilitate a reverse acquisition.

Section 8 - Other Events
Item 8.01 Other Events.

On December 21, 2004, Temporary Financial Services, Inc. (OTCBB: TPFS) entered
into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Toolbuilders Laboratories, Inc.
("TBL"), a Washington corporation. TBL is engaged in the business of inventing,
designing, engineering and producing software products. TBL's flagship product,
the Sempre(TM) Series, is an automated software source code analyzer which finds
and repairs source code errors that could result in security vulnerabilities.

TPFS and TBL expect to enter into a definitive Stock for Stock Exchange
Agreement in January, 2005. It is anticipated that the Definitive Agreement will
result in a change of control of TPFS with the TBL shareholders owning 70% of
TPFS and the current shareholders of TPFS holding the remaining 30% of TPFS
after the transaction. The transaction is expected to provide approximately
$1,600,000 cash to be used by TBL to further the commercialization of the Sempre
Series and other software products currently in development by TBL.

When the transaction is closed, the officers and directors of TPFS will resign
and new officers and directors will be appointed by the shareholders of TBL. A
subsequent Form 8-K filing will be made upon signing the definitive acquisition
agreement
