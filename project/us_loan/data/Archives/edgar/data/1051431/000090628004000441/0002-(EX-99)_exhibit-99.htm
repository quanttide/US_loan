<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 44px">HOUSTON--(December 29, 2004)--Horizon Offshore, Inc. (NASDAQ:
HOFF) announced today that its subsidiary, Horizon Marine Construction, Ltd.,
has signed a contract with West Africa Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAPCo) for
the installation of the West Africa Gas Pipeline. WAPCo is a consortium of
ChevronTexaco, Shell Overseas Holdings Ltd., Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, and Takoradi Power Company Limited of Ghana. The project calls for
the installation of a 20&quot; main gas transportation pipeline which extends 579
kilometers (approximately 360 miles) from Lagos, Nigeria to Takoradi, Ghana and
runs along the coastlines of Togo and Benin with feeder spur lines to each of
those countries. The project planning and preparation will begin immediately
with contract completion expected in October 2006. Horizon plans to use the DLB
SEA HORIZON and LB BRAZOS HORIZON to perform the project. The award of the
contract brings Horizon's backlog to approximately $179 million.</p>

</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 44px">&quot;This major project follows on the heels of our successful
performance of major projects in Israel and Mexico in 2004. We are pleased that
WAPCo has shown its confidence in our ability and intend to reward that
confidence with the same type of performance we have shown on our recent
projects,&quot; said George Reuter, Chief Operating Officer of Horizon.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 44px">The Company also announced that it has selected and is
working with a prospective lender to refinance through a term loan and revolving
credit facility all of the debt outstanding under its revolving credit
facilities with Southwest Bank of Texas, N.A. (Southwest Bank) maturing on
January 21, 2005 and revolving credit facility and term loan with The CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. (CIT Group) maturing later in 2005. The Company
is working with its senior lenders and its subordinated note holders to obtain
all required consents and support to allow the proposed refinancing to proceed.
Assuming that the maturing debt is refinanced, the Company then intends to
proceed in the first quarter of 2005 with increasing its equity through the
recapitalization contemplated in the recapitalization letter agreement that it
entered into with its subordinated note holders in November 2004. </p>
<font SIZE="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 44px">The Company also announced that it will record an estimated
pre-tax charge of $2.2 million to be paid in cash and non-cash charge of $18.3
million that will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004 under generally
accepted accounting principles. The aggregate amount of the charge is based on
estimates that may change as additional information becomes available. The
charges to be paid in cash primarily relate to an estimated $2 million severance
charge resulting from a reduction in the Company's workforce and an estimated
$0.2 million charge resulting from the expenses of moving equipment in
connection with consolidating the Company's Gulf of Mexico marine facilities.
The non-cash charges primarily relate to; an estimated $6.7 million non-cash
impairment charge resulting from the consolidation of the Company's Gulf of
Mexico marine facilities; an estimated $6.1 million non-cash impairment charge
to its existing inventory of platform structures; an estimated net charge of
$3.4 million non-cash charge resulting from the Company's anticipated settlement
of its litigation with Iroquois Gas Transmission LP for less than the amount
that the Company currently has recorded on its balance sheet; an estimated $1.1
million non-cash impairment of vessel charge resulting from the removal from
service of the <i>Cajun Horizon</i>, which has been inactive since 1999; and an
estimated $1 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge resulting from the
Company's evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill of a Mexican
subsidiary of the Company.</p>
