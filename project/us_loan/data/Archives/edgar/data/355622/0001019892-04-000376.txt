Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 20, 2004, Ryan's Restaurant Group, Inc. ("Ryan's"), Ryan's
wholly-owned subsidiary Fire Mountain Restaurants, Inc. ("Fire Mountain") and
Ryan's other direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries refinanced Ryan's
revolving credit facility. The amended and restated credit agreement is among
Ryan's and Fire Mountain as borrowers, Ryan's other direct and indirect
subsidiaries as guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and a
group of lender banks that are identified individually in Exhibit 10.1. The new
revolving credit facility has a five-year term and provides for up to $150
million in revolving loans, with a provision permitting Ryan's to increase the
available amount by $50 million, subject to the terms of the agreement. The $150
million committed amount includes a $25 million letter of credit sublimit and a
$10 million swingline loan sublimit. The new credit facility replaces Ryan's
prior $100 million revolving credit facility, which was due to expire in January
2005.

         Loans under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at various
floating rates plus a variable spread initially set at 1.0%. The amended and
restated credit agreement, like the one it replaces, contains minimum net worth
requirements, maximum leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios, as well
as restrictions on future stock repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures,
investments and sales of assets, and includes standard events of default. As of
September 29, 2004, Ryan's most recently ended fiscal quarter, Ryan's would have
exceeded the minimum net worth requirement by $85,669,000. Loans under the
revolving credit facility, together with Ryan's 9.0% senior notes due January 8,
2008 and its 4.65% senior notes due July 25, 2013, are secured by the equity
interests in Ryan's wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. Loans under
the revolving credit facility are expected to be used to refinance existing
indebtedness, to make capital expenditures, to provide working capital and for
general corporate purposes, including permitted stock repurchases and the
payment of regularly scheduled payments with respect to Ryan's senior notes.

         Attached as Exhibit 10.1 is a copy of the amended and restated credit
agreement.

Item 2.03     Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or Entry into a
              Material Definitive Agreement or an Obligations under an
              Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

         See Item 1.01 above, which is incorporated herein by reference.

                                CREDIT FACILITIES

         2.1      REVOLVING LOANS.

                  (a)  Revolving  Loan  Commitment.  Subject  to the  terms  and
         conditions  set forth  herein,  each  Lender  severally  agrees to make
         revolving  loans  (each  a  "Revolving   Loan"  and   collectively  the
         "Revolving Loans") to the Borrowers,  in Dollars,  at any time and from
         time to time,  during the period from and including the Closing Date to
         but not  including  the  Maturity  Date  (or such  earlier  date if the
         Revolving  Committed  Amount has been  terminated as provided  herein);
         provided,  however,  that  (i)  the  sum of  the  aggregate  amount  of
         Revolving  Loans   outstanding   plus  the  aggregate   amount  of  L/C
         Obligations  outstanding  plus the aggregate  amount of Swingline Loans
         outstanding  shall not exceed the Revolving  Committed  Amount and (ii)
         with respect to each individual  Lender, the Lender's pro rata share of
         outstanding  Revolving  Loans  plus  such  Lender's  pro rata  share of
         outstanding L/C Obligations plus (other than the Swingline Lender) such
         Lender's pro rata share of Swingline Loans outstanding shall not exceed
         such Lender's  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  Percentage of the Revolving
         Committed  Amount.  Subject  to the  terms  of  this  Credit  Agreement
         (including  Section 3.3), the Borrowers may borrow,  repay and reborrow
         Revolving Loans.

                  (b) Method of Borrowing for Revolving  Loans. By no later than
         11:00 a.m.  (i) on the date of the  requested  borrowing  of  Revolving
         Loans that will be Base Rate Loans or (ii) three Business Days prior to
         the date of the  requested  borrowing of  Revolving  Loans that will be
         Eurodollar   Loans,   the  applicable   Borrower  shall  telephone  the
         Administrative  Agent with the  information  described below as well as
         submit a written  Notice of  Borrowing  in the form of Exhibit A to the
         Administrative  Agent  setting  forth  (A) the  amount  requested,  (B)
         whether such Revolving Loans shall accrue interest at the Adjusted Base
         Rate or the  Adjusted  Eurodollar  Rate,  (C) with respect to Revolving
         Loans that will be Eurodollar  Loans,  the Interest  Period  applicable
         thereto and (D) certification that the applicable Borrower has complied
         in all respects with Section 5.2. If the applicable Borrower shall fail
         to specify (x) an  Interest  Period in the case of a  Eurodollar  Loan,
         then such Eurodollar Loan shall be deemed to have an Interest Period of
         one  month,  or (y) the type of  Revolving  Loan  requested,  then such
         Revolving Loan shall be deemed to be a Base Rate Loan.

                  (c) Funding of  Revolving  Loans.  Upon receipt of a Notice of
         Borrowing,  the Administrative  Agent shall promptly inform the Lenders
         as to the terms  thereof.  Each Lender  shall make its  Revolving  Loan
         Commitment Percentage of the requested Revolving Loans available to the
         Administrative  Agent by 1:00 p.m. on the date  specified in the Notice
         of Borrowing by deposit, in Dollars, of immediately  available funds at
         the  offices of the  Administrative  Agent at its  principal  office in
         Charlotte,   North   Carolina   or  at  such   other   address  as  the
         Administrative  Agent  may  designate  in  writing.  The  amount of the
         requested Revolving Loans will then be made available to the applicable
         Borrower by the  Administrative  Agent by crediting  the account of the
         applicable  Borrower on the books of such office of the  Administrative
         Agent,  to the  extent  the  amount  of such  Revolving  Loans are made
         available to the Administrative Agent.

                  No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any
         other  Lender in its  obligation  to make  Revolving  Loans  hereunder;
         provided,  however,  that the  failure  of any  Lender to  fulfill  its
         obligations  hereunder  shall  not  relieve  any  other  Lender  of its
         obligations hereunder.

         Agent,  increase the Revolving  Committed Amount by up to FIFTY MILLION
         DOLLARS  ($50,000,000)  with additional  Commitments  from any existing
         Lender or new Commitments  from any other Person selected by the Parent
         and  approved  by the  Administrative  Agent  (not  to be  unreasonably
         withheld); provided that:

                  (i) any such increase shall be in a minimum  principal  amount
         of $10  million  and in  integral  multiples  of $1  million  in excess
         thereof;

                  (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall be continuing at the
         time of any such increase;

                  (iii) no  existing  Lender  shall be under any  obligation  to
         increase its Commitment  and any such decision  whether to increase its
         Commitment shall be in such Lender's sole and absolute discretion;

                  (iv) any new  Lender  shall  join  this  Credit  Agreement  by
         executing   such   joinder   documents   reasonably   required  by  the
         Administrative Agent; and

                  (v) as a  condition  precedent  to such  increase,  the Parent
         shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent a certificate of each Credit
         Party dated as of the date of such increase (in  sufficient  copies for
         each Lender)  signed by a Responsible  Officer of such Credit Party (A)
         certifying and attaching the  resolutions  adopted by such Credit Party
         approving or  consenting to such  increase,  and (B)  certifying  that,
         before   and   after   giving   effect  to  such   increase,   (1)  the
         representations  and  warranties  contained  in Section 6 and the other
         Credit  Documents  are true and  correct  on and as of the date of such
         increase, except to the extent that such representations and warranties
         specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they were true and
         correct as of such  earlier date and (2) no Default or Event of Default
         exists.

         The  Borrowers  shall prepay any Loans  outstanding  on the date of any
         such  increase (and pay any  additional  amounts  required  pursuant to
         Section  3.14) to the extent  necessary to keep the  outstanding  Loans
         ratable  with any  revised  Commitments  arising  from  any  nonratable
         increase in the Commitments  under this Section  2.1(e).  In connection
         with any such  increase in the  Revolving  Committed  Amount,  Schedule
         1.1(a) shall be revised by the Administrative  Agent to reflect the new
         Commitments and shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to the
         Lenders.

                           of Credit  would  occur  after  the  Letter of Credit
                           Expiration Date, unless all the Lenders have approved
                           such expiry date.

                           (iii) The Issuing  Lender  shall  not  be  under  any
                  obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:

                                    (A) any  order,  judgment  or  decree of any
                          Governmental  Authority  or  arbitrator  shall  by its
                          terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender
                          from  issuing  such  Letter  of  Credit,  or  any  Law
                          applicable  to the  Issuing  Lender or any  request or
                          directive  (whether  or not  having  the force of law)
                          from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
                          the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that the
                          Issuing  Lender  refrain from, the issuance of letters
                          of  credit  generally  or such  Letter  of  Credit  in
                          particular  or shall  impose upon the  Issuing  Lender
                          with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
                          reserve or capital  requirement (for which the Issuing
                          Lender is not otherwise compensated  hereunder) not in
                          effect on the Closing  Date,  or shall impose upon the
                          Issuing Lender any unreimbursed  loss, cost or expense
                          which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which
                          the Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it;

                                    (B) the  issuance  of such  Letter of Credit
                          would  violate  one or more  policies  of the  Issuing
                          Lender;

                                       26
<PAGE>

                                    (C)  except  as  otherwise   agreed  by  the
                          Administrative  Agent  and the  Issuing  Lender,  such
                          Letter of Credit is in an initial  stated  amount less
                          than $100,000,  in the case of a commercial  Letter of
                          Credit,  or $500,000,  in the case of a standby Letter
                          of Credit;

                                    (D)  such   Letter   of   Credit  is  to  be
                          denominated in a currency other than Dollars;

                                    (E)  such  Letter  of  Credit  contains  any
                          provisions for automatic  reinstatement  of the stated
                          amount after any drawing thereunder; or

                                    (F) a default of any Lender's obligations to
                          fund under  Section  2.2(c) exists or any Lender is at
                          such time a Defaulting  Lender  hereunder,  unless the
                          Issuing   Lender   has   entered   into   satisfactory
                          arrangements  with  such  Borrower  or such  Lender to
                          eliminate  the Issuing  Lender's  risk with respect to
                          such Lender.

                           (iv) The Issuing Lender shall not amend any Letter of
                  Credit if the Issuing  Lender  would not be  permitted at such
                  time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended  form under
                  the terms hereof.

                          (v) The Issuing Lender shall be under no obligation to
                  amend any  Letter of Credit if (i) the  Issuing  Lender  would
                  have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit
                  in its  amended  form  under  the  terms  hereof,  or (ii) the
                  beneficiary  of such  Letter of  Credit  does not  accept  the
                  proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

                          (vi) The  Issuing  Lender  shall  act on behalf of the
                  Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and
                  the documents  associated  therewith,  and the Issuing  Lender
                  shall have all of the benefits and  immunities (A) provided to
                  the  Administrative  Agent in Section  10 with  respect to any
                  acts taken or  omissions  suffered  by the  Issuing  Lender in
                  connection  with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to
                  be  issued  by it and  Issuer  Documents  pertaining  to  such
                  Letters  of  Credit  as fully  as if the term  "Administrative
                  Agent" as used in Section 10 included the Issuing  Lender with
                  respect  to such acts or  omissions,  and (B) as  additionally
                  provided herein with respect to the Issuing Lender.

         (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit.

                  (i) Each Letter of Credit  shall be issued or amended,  as the
         case may be,  upon the request of a Borrower  delivered  to the Issuing
         Lender  (with  a copy to the  Administrative  Agent)  in the  form of a
         Letter of Credit Application,  appropriately  completed and signed by a
         Responsible Officer of such Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application
         must be received by the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent not
         later than 11:00 a.m.  at least two  Business  Days (or such later date
         and time as the  Administrative  Agent and the Issuing Lender may agree
         in a  particular  instance  in  their  sole  discretion)  prior  to the
         proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the
         case of a request for an initial  issuance of a Letter of Credit,  such
         Letter  of  Credit   Application  shall  specify  in  form  and  detail
         reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Issuing  Lender:  (A)  the  proposed
         issuance  date of the  requested  Letter  of Credit  (which  shall be a
         Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D)
         the name and address of the beneficiary  thereof;  (E) the documents to

                                       27
<PAGE>

         be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F)
         the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in
         case of any  drawing  thereunder;  and (G) such  other  matters  as the
         Issuing Lender may reasonably  require. In the case of a request for an
         amendment of any  outstanding  Letter of Credit,  such Letter of Credit
         Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to
         the  Issuing  Lender  (A) the Letter of Credit to be  amended;  (B) the
         proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C)
         the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the
         Issuing Lender may  reasonably  require.  Additionally,  the applicable
         Borrower  shall  furnish to the Issuing  Lender and the  Administrative
         Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested
         Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents,
         as the  Issuing  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent  may  reasonably
         require.

                  (ii)   Promptly   after   receipt  of  any  Letter  of  Credit
         Application,  the Issuing  Lender will confirm with the  Administrative
         Agent (by  telephone or in writing) that the  Administrative  Agent has
         received  a  copy  of  such  Letter  of  Credit  Application  from  the
         applicable  Borrower  and, if not, the Issuing  Lender will provide the
         Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Lender has
         received written notice from any Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent or
         any Credit Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date
         of issuance or amendment of the applicable  Letter of Credit,  that one
         or more applicable  conditions contained in Section 9 shall not then be
         satisfied,  then,  subject  to the terms  and  conditions  hereof,  the
         Issuing Lender shall, on the requested  date,  issue a Letter of Credit
         for  the  account  of  the  applicable   Borrower  (or  the  applicable
         Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be,
         in each  case  in  accordance  with  the  Issuing  Lender's  usual  and
         customary  business  practices.  Immediately  upon the issuance of each
         Letter  of  Credit,   each  Lender  shall  be  deemed  to,  and  hereby
         irrevocably  and  unconditionally  agrees to, purchase from the Issuing
         Lender a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal
         to the product of such Lender's Applicable  Percentage times the amount
         of such Letter of Credit.

                  (iii) If a Borrower so requests  in any  applicable  Letter of
         Credit  Application,  the Issuing  Lender may, in its sole and absolute
         discretion,  agree to  issue a  Letter  of  Credit  that has  automatic
         extension  provisions  (each,  an  "Auto-Extension  Letter of Credit");
         provided that any such Auto-Extension  Letter of Credit must permit the
         Issuing  Lender to  prevent  any such  extension  at least once in each
         twelve-month  period  (commencing  with  the date of  issuance  of such
         Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not
         later  than a day  (the  "Non-Extension  Notice  Date")  in  each  such
         twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit
         is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Lender, a Borrower
         shall not be required to make a specific  request to the Issuing Lender
         for any such  extension.  Once an  Auto-Extension  Letter of Credit has
         been issued,  the Lenders shall be deemed to have  authorized  (but may
         not require) the Issuing  Lender to permit the extension of such Letter
         of Credit at any time to an expiry  date not later  than the  Letter of
         Credit  Expiration  Date;  provided,  however,  that the Issuing Lender
         shall not  permit  any such  extension  if (A) the  Issuing  Lender has
         determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation,
         at such time to issue  such  Letter of Credit in its  revised  form (as
         extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause
         (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.3(a) or  otherwise),  or (B) it has received
         notice  (which may be by  telephone or in writing) on or before the day
         that is five  Business  Days before the  Non-Extension  Notice Date (1)
         from the  Administrative  Agent that the Required  Lenders have elected
         not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative  Agent, any

                                       28
<PAGE>

         Lender  or a  Borrower  that one or more of the  applicable  conditions
         specified in Section 5.2 is not then  satisfied,  and in each such case
         directing the Issuing Lender not to permit such extension.

                  (iv)  Promptly  after its  delivery of any Letter of Credit or
         any  amendment  to a Letter of Credit to an advising  bank with respect
         thereto or to the  beneficiary  thereof,  the Issuing  Lender will also
         deliver  to the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative  Agent  a true  and
         complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

         (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                  (i) Upon receipt from the  beneficiary of any Letter of Credit
         of any notice of a drawing  under such  Letter of Credit,  the  Issuing
         Lender shall  notify the  applicable  Borrower  and the  Administrative
         Agent thereof.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by
         the Issuing  Lender under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor
         Date"),  the  applicable  Borrower  shall  reimburse the Issuing Lender
         through the  Administrative  Agent in an amount  equal to the amount of
         such  drawing.  If the  applicable  Borrower  fails to so reimburse the
         Issuing  Lender by such time, the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly
         notify each Lender of the Honor  Date,  the amount of the  unreimbursed
         drawing (the  "Unreimbursed  Amount"),  and the amount of such Lender's
         Applicable  Percentage  thereof. In such event, the applicable Borrower
         shall be deemed to have  requested a Committed  Borrowing  of Base Rate
         Loans to be  disbursed  on the  Honor  Date in an  amount  equal to the
         Unreimbursed  Amount,  without  regard  to the  minimum  and  multiples
         specified in Section 2.1 for the  principal  amount of Base Rate Loans,
         but subject to the amount of the  unutilized  portion of the  Aggregate
         Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the
         delivery of a Loan Notice).  Any notice given by the Issuing  Lender or
         the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant to this Section  2.2(c)(i)  may be
         given by telephone if immediately  confirmed in writing;  provided that
         the  lack  of such an  immediate  confirmation  shall  not  affect  the
         conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

                  (ii) Each  Lender  shall upon any notice  pursuant  to Section
         2.2(c)(i)  make funds  available  to the  Administrative  Agent for the
         account of the Issuing Lender at the  Administrative  Agent's Office in
         an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount
         not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business  Day  specified in such notice
         by the Administrative  Agent,  whereupon,  subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.2(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be
         deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such
         amount. The  Administrative  Agent shall remit the funds so received to
         the Issuing Lender.

                  (iii) With  respect  to any  Unreimbursed  Amount  that is not
         fully  refinanced  by a  Borrowing  of  Base  Rate  Loans  because  the
         conditions  set forth in  Section  5.2 cannot be  satisfied  or for any
         other reason, the applicable  Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred
         from  the  Issuing  Lender  an  L/C  Borrowing  in  the  amount  of the
         Unreimbursed  Amount  that is not so  refinanced,  which L/C  Borrowing
         shall be due and payable on demand  (together  with interest) and shall
         bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment
         to the  Administrative  Agent for the  account  of the  Issuing  Lender
         pursuant to Section  2.2(c)(ii)  shall be deemed  payment in respect of
         its  participation  in such L/C Borrowing  and shall  constitute an L/C
         Advance  from  such  Lender  in  satisfaction   of  its   participation
         obligation under this Section 2.2.

                  (iv) Until each Lender funds its Loan or L/C Advance  pursuant
         to this Section  2.2(c) to reimburse the Issuing  Lender for any amount
         drawn under any Letter of Credit,  interest in respect of such Lender's
         Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of
         the Issuing Lender.

                                       29
<PAGE>

                  (v) Each Lender's  obligation to make Loans or L/C Advances to
         reimburse the Issuing Lender for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit,
         as  contemplated  by  this  Section  2.2(c),   shall  be  absolute  and
         unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,  including
         (A) any setoff, counterclaim,  recoupment, defense or other right which
         such  Lender  may have  against  the  Issuing  Lender,  the  applicable
         Borrower  or any  other  Person  for  any  reason  whatsoever;  (B) the
         occurrence or  continuance of a Default,  or (C) any other  occurrence,
         event or  condition,  whether or not  similar to any of the  foregoing;
         provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Loans pursuant
         to this Section  2.2(c) is not subject to the  conditions  set forth in
         Section 5.2 (other than delivery by the  applicable  Borrower of a Loan
         Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance  shall  relieve or otherwise
         impair the  obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Lender
         for the amount of any  payment  made by the  Issuing  Lender  under any
         Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

                  (iv)  If  any   Lender   fails  to  make   available   to  the
         Administrative  Agent for the account of the Issuing  Lender any amount
         required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
         of this Section 2.2(c) by the time specified in Section 2.2(c)(ii), the
         Issuing  Lender shall be entitled to recover  from such Lender  (acting
         through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
         thereon  for the period  from the date such  payment is required to the
         date on which such  payment is  immediately  available  to the  Issuing
         Lender at a rate per annum equal to the  greater of the  Federal  Funds
         Rate and a rate  determined by the Issuing  Lender in  accordance  with
         banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  A certificate of the
         Issuing  Lender  submitted to any Lender  (through  the  Administrative
         Agent) with  respect to any amounts  owing under this clause (vi) shall
         be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) Repayment of Participations.

                           (i) At any time after the  Issuing  Lender has made a
         payment  under any  Letter of Credit and has  received  from any Lender
         such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
         Section 2.2(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of
         the Issuing  Lender any payment in respect of the related  Unreimbursed
         Amount or  interest  thereon  (whether  directly  from the  Borrower or
         otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
         Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
         Lender its Applicable  Percentage thereof  (appropriately  adjusted, in
         the case of  interest  payments,  to reflect  the period of time during
         which such Lender's L/C Advance was  outstanding)  in the same funds as
         those received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (ii) If any payment received by the  Administrative  Agent for
         the account of the Issuing  Lender  pursuant  to Section  2.2(c)(i)  is
         required to be returned  under any of the  circumstances  described  in
         Section 11.14 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
         Issuing  Lender  in  its  discretion),  each  Lender  shall  pay to the
         Administrative  Agent  for  the  account  of  the  Issuing  Lender  its
         Applicable  Percentage thereof on demand of the  Administrative  Agent,
         plus  interest  thereon  from the date of such  demand to the date such
         amount is  returned  by such  Lender,  at a rate per annum equal to the
         Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the
         Lenders  under this  clause  shall  survive  the payment in full of the
         Credit Party Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.

         (e) Obligations Absolute.  The obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse
the  Issuing  Lender for each  drawing  under each Letter of Credit and to repay

                                       30
<PAGE>

each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute,  unconditional and irrevocable,  and shall
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

                  (i) any lack of validity or  enforceability  of such Letter of
         Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other Credit Document;

                  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense
         or other right that the applicable  Borrower or any Subsidiary may have
         at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of
         Credit  (or any  Person  for  whom  any  such  beneficiary  or any such
         transferee  may be  acting),  the Issuing  Lender or any other  Person,
         whether in  connection  with this Credit  Agreement,  the  transactions
         contemplated  hereby or by such  Letter of Credit or any  agreement  or
         instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                  (iii)  any  draft,  demand,   certificate  or  other  document
         presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient  in any respect or any statement  therein being
         untrue  or  inaccurate  in any  respect;  or any  loss or  delay in the
         transmission  or otherwise of any document  required in order to make a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                  (iv) any  payment by the Issuing  Lender  under such Letter of
         Credit against  presentation  of a draft or  certificate  that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment
         made by the  Issuing  Lender  under such Letter of Credit to any Person
         purporting  to  be  a  trustee  in  bankruptcy,   debtor-in-possession,
         assignee for the benefit of  creditors,  liquidator,  receiver or other
         representative  of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of
         such Letter of Credit,  including  any arising in  connection  with any
         proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                  (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing,  including any other  circumstance
         that might otherwise  constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
         of, any Borrower or any Subsidiary.

         The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of
Credit and each  amendment  thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of
any  claim  of  noncompliance   with  such  Borrower's   instructions  or  other
irregularity,  such Borrower will  immediately  notify the Issuing  Lender.  The
Borrowers shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the
Issuing Lender and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

         (f) Role of Issuing  Lender.  Each Lender and the Borrowers agree that,
in paying any drawing  under a Letter of Credit,  the Issuing  Lender  shall not
have any  responsibility  to obtain any  document  (other than any sight  draft,
certificates  and  documents  expressly  required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such  document or the
authority of the Person  executing or delivering any such document.  None of the
Issuing  Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent,  any of their  respective  Related
Parties nor any  correspondent,  participant  or assignee of the Issuing  Lender
shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in  connection
herewith  at the request or with the  approval  of the  Lenders or the  Required
Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful  misconduct;  or (iii) the due  execution,  effectiveness,
validity or enforceability  of any document or instrument  related to any Letter
of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any  beneficiary  or  transferee  with respect to its use of any

                                       31
<PAGE>

Letter of Credit;  provided,  however,  that this assumption is not intended to,
and shall not, preclude a Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may
have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other  agreement.
None of the Issuing Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent, any of their respective
Related  Parties nor any  correspondent,  participant or assignee of the Issuing
Lender  shall be liable  or  responsible  for any of the  matters  described  in
clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.2(e);  provided,  however, that anything in
such  clauses  to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  a  Borrower  may have a claim
against the Issuing Lender,  and the Issuing Lender may be liable to a Borrower,
to  the  extent,  but  only  to  the  extent,  of  any  direct,  as  opposed  to
consequential  or exemplary,  damages suffered by a Borrower which such Borrower
proves  were  caused  by  the  Issuing  Lender's  willful  misconduct  or  gross
negligence or the Issuing  Lender's  willful  failure to pay under any Letter of
Credit  after the  presentation  to it by the  beneficiary  of a sight draft and
certificate(s)  strictly  complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
Credit.  In  furtherance  and not in  limitation of the  foregoing,  the Issuing
Lender may accept  documents  that appear on their face to be in order,  without
responsibility   for  further   investigation,   regardless  of  any  notice  or
information to the contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for
the  validity or  sufficiency  of any  instrument  transferring  or assigning or
purporting  to  transfer  or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder  or  proceeds  thereof,  in whole or in part,  which  may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g) Cash Collateral.  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i)
if the Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial  drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing,  or (ii) if,
as of the Letter of Credit  Expiration  Date,  any L/C Obligation for any reason
remains  outstanding,  the  Borrower  shall,  in  each  case,  immediately  Cash
Collateralize the then Outstanding  Amount of all L/C Obligations.  Sections 3.3
and 9.2(c) set forth certain additional  requirements to deliver Cash Collateral
hereunder.  For purposes of this Section  2.2,  Section 3.3 and Section  9.2(c),
"Cash  Collateralize"  means  to  pledge  and  deposit  with or  deliver  to the
Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders, as
collateral  for the L/C  Obligations,  cash or deposit  account  balances  (such
collateral,  "Cash Collateral")  pursuant to documentation in form and substance
reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Issuing  Lender
(which  documents are hereby  consented to by the Lenders).  Derivatives of such
term  have   corresponding   meanings.   The  Borrowers   hereby  grant  to  the
Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders,  a
security  interest in all such cash,  deposit  accounts and all balances therein
and all  proceeds of the  foregoing.  Cash  Collateral  shall be  maintained  in
blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.

         (h) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise  expressly agreed by
the Issuing Lender and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued
(including any such agreement  applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit),  (i)
the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit,  and (ii) the
rules of the Uniform  Customs and  Practice  for  Documentary  Credits,  as most
recently  published  by the  International  Chamber of  Commerce  at the time of
issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

         (i)  Conflict  with  Issuer  Documents.  In the  event of any  conflict
between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document,  the terms hereof
shall control.

         (j) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding  that a
Letter  of  Credit  issued  or  outstanding  hereunder  is  in  support  of  any
obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary,  the applicable Borrower
shall be obligated to reimburse  the Issuing  Lender  hereunder  for any and all
drawings under such Letter of Credit.  The Borrowers hereby acknowledge that the
issuance  of  Letters of Credit for the  account of  Subsidiaries  inures to the
benefit of the Borrowers,  and that the Borrowers'  business derives substantial
benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.

         2.3      SWINGLINE LOANS SUBFACILITY.

                  (a) Swingline Loans.  The Swingline  Lender hereby agrees,  on
         the terms and  subject to the  conditions  set forth  herein and in the
         other Credit  Documents,  to make loans to the  Borrowers in Dollars at
         any time and from time to time during the period from and including the
         Closing Date to but not  including the Maturity Date (each such loan, a
         "Swingline Loan" and  collectively,  the "Swingline  Loans");  provided
         that  (i)  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Swingline  Loans
         outstanding  at any one time shall not exceed the  Swingline  Committed
         Amount and (ii) the  aggregate  amount of Swingline  Loans  outstanding
         plus the  aggregate  amount of  Revolving  Loans  outstanding  plus the
         aggregate  amount of L/C Obligations  outstanding  shall not exceed the
         Revolving Committed Amount. Prior to the Maturity Date, Swingline Loans
         may be repaid and  reborrowed by the  Borrowers in accordance  with the
         provisions hereof.

                  (b) Method of Borrowing  and Funding  Swingline  Loans.  By no
         later  than  1:00  p.m.,  on the  date of the  requested  borrowing  of
         Swingline  Loans,  the Parent shall  telephone the Swingline  Lender as
         well as submit a Swingline Loan Request to the Swingline  Lender in the
         form of  Exhibit  C  setting  forth  (A) the  amount  of the  requested
         Swingline  Loan,  (B) the date of the requested  Swingline Loan and (C)
         certification that the Parent has in all respects complied with Section
         5.2.  The  Swingline  Lender  shall  initiate  the  transfer  of  funds
         representing  the Swingline  Loan advance to the Parent by 3:00 p.m. on
         the Business Day of the requested borrowing.

                  (c)  Repayment and  Participations  of Swingline  Loans.  Each
         Borrower agrees to repay all Swingline Loans on the earlier to occur of
         (i) the date ten Business  Days after such  Swingline  Loan is made and
         (ii) the  Maturity  Date.  Each  repayment  of a Swingline  Loan may be
         accomplished by requesting Revolving Loans which request is not subject
         to the  conditions  set  forth in  Section  5.2.  In the  event  that a
         Borrower  shall fail to timely  repay any  Swingline  Loan,  and in any
         event upon (A) a request by the Swingline Lender, (B) the occurrence of
         an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(f) or (C) the acceleration
         of any Loan or termination  of any Commitment  pursuant to Section 9.2,
         each other Lender shall irrevocably and  unconditionally  purchase from
         the  Swingline  Lender,  without  recourse or  warranty,  an  undivided
         interest and participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to
         such other Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment  Percentage  thereof,  by
         directly  purchasing a  participation  in such  Swingline  Loan in such
         amount  (regardless  of whether the  conditions  precedent  thereto set
         forth in Section 5.2 are then satisfied,  whether or not the Parent has
         submitted a Notice of Borrowing and whether or not the  Commitments are
         then in effect,  any Event of Default exists or all the Loans have been
         accelerated) and paying the proceeds thereof to the Swingline Lender at
         the address  provided in Section  11.1, or at such other address as the
         Swingline Lender may designate, in Dollars and in immediately available
         funds.  If such amount is not in fact made  available to the  Swingline
         Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover
         such amount on demand from such Lender,  together with accrued interest
         thereon  for each day from the date of demand  thereof,  at the Federal
         Funds Rate. If such Lender does not pay such amount  forthwith upon the
         Swingline Lender's demand therefor,  and until such time as such Lender
         makes the required  payment,  the  Swingline  Lender shall be deemed to
         continue  to have  outstanding  Swingline  Loans in the  amount of such
         unpaid  participation   obligation  for  all  purposes  of  the  Credit
         Documents  other than those  provisions  requiring the other Lenders to
         purchase a participation therein.  Further, such Lender shall be deemed
         to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on
         its Loans,  and any other  amounts due to it hereunder to the Swingline
         Lender to fund Swingline  Loans in the amount of the  participation  in
         Swingline  Loans that such Lender  failed to purchase  pursuant to this
         Section  2.3(c)  until such amount has been  purchased  (as a result of
         such assignment or otherwise).

                                       33
<PAGE>

                  (d) Swingline  Note. The Swingline Loans made by the Swingline
         Lender  shall be evidenced by a duly  executed  promissory  note of the
         Borrowers to the  Swingline  Lender in the face amount of the Swingline
         Committed Amount and in substantially the form of Exhibit D.

         2.4      CONTINUATIONS AND CONVERSIONS.

         The Borrowers  shall have the option,  on any Business Day, to continue
existing  Revolving  Loans that are Eurodollar  Loans for a subsequent  Interest
Period,  to convert  Revolving  Loans  that are Base Rate Loans into  Eurodollar
Loans or to convert  Revolving  Loans that are  Eurodollar  Loans into Base Rate
Loans; provided,  however, that (a) each such continuation or conversion must be
requested by the applicable  Borrower by telephone to the  Administrative  Agent
followed by prompt submission of a written Notice of Continuation/Conversion, in
the form of Exhibit E, in compliance with the terms set forth below,  (b) except
as provided in Section 3.13, Eurodollar Loans may only be continued or converted
into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable  thereto,
(c)  Eurodollar  Loans may not be continued nor may Base Rate Loans be converted
into Eurodollar  Loans during the existence and  continuation of a Default or an
Event of Default,  (d) any request to continue a  Eurodollar  Loan that fails to
comply  with the terms  hereof or any  failure  to request a  continuation  of a
Eurodollar Loan at the end of an Interest  Period shall  constitute a conversion
to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the  applicable  Interest  Period and (e)
any request for continuation or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan which shall fail
to specify an  Interest  Period  shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest
Period of one month.  Each  continuation  or conversion must be requested by the
applicable  Borrower  no later than 11:00 a.m.  (i) on the date for a  requested
conversion of a Eurodollar  Loan to a Base Rate Loan or (ii) three Business Days
prior  to  the  date  for a  requested  continuation  of a  Eurodollar  Loan  or
conversion  of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar  Loan, in each case by telephone
to   the    Administrative    Agent    followed   by   a   written   Notice   of
Continuation/Conversion  promptly  submitted to the  Administrative  Agent which
shall set forth (A)  whether  the  applicable  Borrower  intends to  continue or
convert  such Loans and (B) if the request is to continue a  Eurodollar  Loan or
convert a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar  Loan, the Interest  Period  applicable
thereto.

         2.5      MINIMUM AMOUNTS.

         Each  request for a  borrowing,  conversion  or  continuation  shall be
subject to the  requirements  that (a) each  Eurodollar Loan that is a Revolving
Loan and each  Base Rate Loan  that is a  Revolving  Loan  shall be in a minimum
amount of $3,000,000 and in integral  multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof or
the remaining amount available under the Revolving Committed Amount, if less (b)
each  Swingline  Loan shall be in a minimum  amount of $250,000  and in integral
multiples  of  $250,000  in  excess  thereof  (or the  remaining  amount  of the
Swingline  Committed  Amount,  if less) and (c) no more than ten (10) Eurodollar
Loans that are Revolving  Loans shall be outstanding  hereunder at any one time.
For the purposes of this Section,  all Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Loans
with the same  Interest  Periods  that  begin and end on the same date  shall be
considered as one Eurodollar Loan, but Eurodollar Loans with different  Interest
Periods,  even if they begin on the same date,  shall be  considered as separate
Eurodollar Loans.

         2.6      JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF BORROWERS.

         (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  accepts,  not
merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the
other Borrower with respect to the payment and  performance of all of the Credit
Party Obligations,  it being the intention of the parties hereto that all of the
Credit  Party  Obligations  shall be the joint and several  obligations  of each
Borrower without preferences or distinction among them.

                                       34
<PAGE>

         (b) If and to the  extent  that  any  Borrower  shall  fail to make any
payment when due, or perform,  any of the Credit Party Obligations in accordance
with the terms  thereof,  then in each such event,  the other Borrower will make
pay, or perform, such Credit Party Obligation.

         (c) The  obligations  of each  Borrower  under the  provisions  of this
Section 2.6 constitute full recourse  obligations of such Borrower,  enforceable
against it to the full extent of its properties and assets,  irrespective of the
validity,  regularity or  enforceability  of this Credit  Agreement or any other
circumstances whatsoever.

         (d) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Borrower hereby
waives  notice  of  acceptance  of its joint and  several  liability,  notice of
occurrence  of any Default or Event of Default  (except to the extent  notice is
expressly  required to be given pursuant to the terms of this Credit Agreement),
or of any demand for any  payment  under this  Credit  Agreement,  notice of any
action at any time taken or omitted by the Lender  under or in respect of any of
the Credit Party Obligations,  any requirement of diligence and, generally,  all
demands,  notices and other  formalities  of every kind in connection  with this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document.  Each Borrower hereby assents to,
and waives notice of, any extension or  postponement of the time for the payment
of any of the Credit Party  Obligations,  the acceptance of any partial  payment
thereon,  any waiver,  consent or other action or acquiescence by the Lenders at
any time or times in respect of any default by any  Borrower in the  performance
or  satisfaction  of any term,  covenant,  condition or provision of this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document, any and all other indulgences whatsoever
by the  Lenders  in  respect of any of the  Credit  Party  Obligations,  and the
taking,  addition,  substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or
times, of any security for any of the Credit Party  Obligations or the addition,
substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower.  Without limiting
the  generality of the foregoing,  each Borrower  assents to any other action or
delay in  acting or any  failure  to act on the part of the  Lender,  including,
without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to
pursue  any  remedy or to  comply  fully  with  applicable  laws or  regulations
thereunder  which might,  but for the  provisions  of this  Section 2.6,  afford
grounds for terminating,  discharging or relieving such Borrower, in whole or in
part, from any of its obligations under this Section 2.6, it being the intention
of each  Borrower  that, so long as any of the Credit Party  Obligations  remain
unsatisfied,  the  obligations of such Borrower under this Section 2.6 shall not
be  discharged  except  by  performance  and  then  only to the  extent  of such
performance.  The  obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.6 shall not
be  diminished  or rendered  unenforceable  by any  winding up,  reorganization,
arrangement,  liquidation,  reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to
any  reconstruction  or similar  proceeding  with respect to any Borrower or any
Lender.  The  joint and  several  liability  of the  Borrowers  hereunder  shall
continue  in full  force and  effect  notwithstanding  any  absorption,  merger,
amalgamation   or  any  other  change   whatsoever  in  the  name,   membership,
constitution or place of formation of any Borrower or any Lender.

         (e) The  provisions of this Section 2.6 are made for the benefit of the
Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders  and  their  respective  successors  and
assigns, and may be enforced by any such Person from time to time against any of
the Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on
the part of any Lender  first to marshal any of its claims or to exercise any of
its  rights  against  any of the other  Borrowers  or to  exhaust  any  remedies
available  to it against  any of the other  Borrowers  or to resort to any other
source or means of obtaining  payment of any of the Credit Party  Obligations or
to elect any other  remedy.  The  provisions of this Section 2.6 shall remain in
effect until all the Credit Party Obligations  hereunder shall have been paid in
full or otherwise  fully  satisfied.  If at any time,  any payment,  or any part
thereof, made in respect of any of the Credit Party Obligations, is rescinded or
must  otherwise  be restored or  returned  by the Lenders  upon the  insolvency,
bankruptcy  or  reorganization  of any  of  the  Borrowers,  or  otherwise,  the
provisions  of this Section 2.6 will  forthwith be  reinstated  and in effect as
though such payment had not been made.

                                       35
<PAGE>

         (f)  Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary contained herein or
in any of the other  Credit  Documents,  to the  extent the  obligations  of any
Borrower  shall be  adjudicated  to be invalid or  unenforceable  for any reason
(including,  without limitation,  because of any applicable state or federal law
relating to fraudulent  conveyances or transfers)  then the  obligations of such
Borrower  hereunder  shall be limited to the maximum  amount that is permissible
under  applicable  law  (whether   federal  or  state  and  including,   without
limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).

         2.7      AGENCY OF THE PARENT FOR FIRE MOUNTAIN.

         Fire  Mountain  appoints  the  Parent  as its  agent  for all  purposes
relevant to this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents,  including the
giving and  receipt of notices and  execution  and  delivery  of all  documents,
instruments and certificates  contemplated herein and all modifications  hereto.
Any notice,  acknowledgment,  consent, direction,  certification or other action
which might  otherwise be valid or  effective  only if given or taken by both of
the Borrowers or acting  singly,  shall be valid and effective if given or taken
only by the Parent, whether or not Fire Mountain joins therein.



                                    SECTION 3

          GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

         3.1      INTEREST.

                  (a) Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1(b):

                           (i) Base  Rate  Loans.  During  such  periods  as the
                  Revolving Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base
                  Rate Loans,  such Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per

                           (ii)  Eurodollar  Loans.  During such  periods as the
                  Revolving  Loans  shall  be  comprised  in whole or in part of

                  (c)  Interest  Payments.  Interest  on Loans  shall be due and
         payable  in arrears  on each  Interest  Payment  Date.  If an  Interest
         Payment Date falls on a date which is not a Business Day, such Interest
         Payment Date shall be deemed to be the next  succeeding  Business  Day,
         except that in the case of Eurodollar  Loans where the next  succeeding
         Business Day falls in the next succeeding  calendar month,  then on the
         next preceding Business Day.

         3.2      PLACE AND MANNER OF PAYMENTS; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK.

                  (a) General.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be
         made  without  condition or deduction  for any  counterclaim,  defense,
         recoupment  or setoff.  All  payments  of  principal,  interest,  fees,
         expenses  and other  amounts  to be made by a Credit  Party  under this
         Credit Agreement shall be received not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date
         when  due,  in  Dollars  and in  immediately  available  funds,  by the
         Administrative  Agent at its  offices  in  Charlotte,  North  Carolina.
         Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received
         on the next Business Day. Each Borrower shall, at the time it makes any
         payment  under this  Credit  Agreement,  specify to the  Administrative
         Agent the Loans,  Letters of Credit,  fees or other amounts  payable by
         the Borrowers  hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in
         the event that it fails to  specify,  or if such  application  would be
         inconsistent  with the terms  hereof,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
         distribute   such  payment  to  the  Lenders  in  such  manner  as  the
         Administrative   Agent   may   reasonably   deem   appropriate).    The
         Administrative  Agent will  distribute  such payments to the applicable
         Lenders on the same Business Day if any such payment is received  prior
         to 2:00 p.m.;  otherwise the Administrative  Agent will distribute such
         payment to the applicable Lenders on the next succeeding  Business Day.
         Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which
         is not a Business  Day, the due date  thereof  shall be extended to the
         next  succeeding  Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and fees
         for  the  period  of  such  extension),  except  that  in the  case  of
         Eurodollar  Loans,  if the extension would cause the payment to be made
         in the next following  calendar month,  then such payment shall instead
         be made on the next preceding Business Day.

                  (b) (i)  Funding by  Lenders;  Presumption  by  Administrative
         Agent. Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from
         a Lender prior to the  proposed  date of any  Revolving  Loan that such
         Lender  will  not  make  available  to the  Administrative  Agent  such
         Lender's share of such Revolving  Loan,  the  Administrative  Agent may
         assume that such Lender has made such share  available  on such date in
         accordance with Section 2.1 and may, in reliance upon such  assumption,
         make available to the Borrower a corresponding  amount.  In such event,
         if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable  Revolving
         Loan available to the Administrative  Agent, then the applicable Lender
         and  the   applicable   Borrower   severally   agree   to  pay  to  the
         Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding  amount in
         immediately  available funds with interest  thereon,  for each day from
         and including  the date such amount is made  available to such Borrower
         to but excluding the date of payment to the  Administrative  Agent,  at
         (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender,  the greater of
         the  Federal  Funds Rate and a rate  determined  by the  Administrative
         Agent  in  accordance   with  banking   industry   rules  on  interbank
         compensation  and  (B) in the  case  of a  payment  to be  made  by the
         Borrower,  the interest  rate  applicable  to Base Rate Loans.  If such
         Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the  Administrative
         Agent for the same or an overlapping  period, the Administrative  Agent
         shall  promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid
         by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the
         applicable Revolving Loan to the Administrative  Agent, then the amount
         so paid  shall  constitute  such  Lender's  Revolving  Loan  Commitment
         Percentage  included in such Revolving  Loan. Any payment by a Borrower
         shall be without  prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against
         a  Lender  that  shall  have  failed  to  make  such   payment  to  the
         Administrative Agent.

                  (ii) Payments by  Borrowers;  Presumptions  by  Administrative
         Agent. Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from
         a  Borrower  prior  to the  date on  which  any  payment  is due to the
         Administrative  Agent for the  account of the  Lenders  or the  Issuing

                                       37
<PAGE>

         Lender  hereunder  that such Borrower  will not make such payment,  the
         Administrative  Agent  may  assume  that  such  Borrower  has made such
         payment on such date in  accordance  herewith and may, in reliance upon
         such  assumption,  distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender,  as
         the case may be, the amount due. In such event,  if such  Borrower  has
         not in fact made such payment,  then each of the Lenders or the Issuing
         Lender,  as  the  case  may  be,  severally  agrees  to  repay  to  the
         Administrative  Agent  forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to
         such Lender or the Issuing Lender, in immediately  available funds with
         interest thereon,  for each day from and including the date such amount
         is  distributed  to it to but  excluding  the  date of  payment  to the
         Administrative  Agent,  at the greater of the Federal  Funds Rate and a
         rate determined by the Administrative  Agent in accordance with banking
         industry rules on interbank compensation.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with
         respect  to any  amount  owing  under  this  subsection  (b)  shall  be
         conclusive, absent manifest error.

                  (c)  Obligations of Lenders  Several.  The  obligations of the
         Lenders  hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund  participations  in
         Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments  pursuant to
         Section 11.6(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to
         make any Loan,  to fund any such  participation  or to make any payment
         under Section 11.6(c) on any date required  hereunder shall not relieve
         any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date,
         and no Lender shall be responsible  for the failure of any other Lender
         to so make its  Loan,  to  purchase  its  participation  or to make its
         payment under Section 11.6(c).

         3.3      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrowers shall have the right
         to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time  without  premium
         or penalty;  provided,  however,  that (i) Eurodollar Loans may only be
         prepaid  on  three   Business   Days'  prior  written   notice  to  the
         Administrative  Agent and (ii) each such  partial  prepayment  of Loans
         shall be in the minimum  principal  amount of  $3,000,000  and integral
         multiples of $500,000 in excess  thereof.  All  prepayments  under this
         Section shall be subject to Section 3.14, shall be applied to the Loans
         and L/C Obligations as the Borrowers may elect and shall be accompanied
         by  interest  on the  principal  amount  prepaid  through  the  date of
         prepayment;  provided  that  if the  Borrowers  fail to  specify  how a
         prepayment  should be applied,  then such  prepayment  shall be applied
         first  to  Revolving  Loans  (first  to Base  Rate  Loans  and  then to
         Eurodollar  Loans in direct order of Interest  Period  maturities)  and
         then to Swingline Loans.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i) Revolving  Committed  Amount.  If at any time the
                  sum of the  aggregate  amount of Revolving  Loans  outstanding
                  plus  L/C   Obligations   outstanding   plus  Swingline  Loans
                  outstanding exceeds the Revolving Committed Amount, the Parent
                  shall   immediately   make   a   principal   payment   to  the
                  Administrative  Agent in the manner and in an amount such that
                  the sum of the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans outstanding
                  plus  L/C   Obligations   outstanding   plus  Swingline  Loans
                  outstanding  is less than or equal to the Revolving  Committed
                  Amount  (to be  applied  as set  forth in  Section  3.3(b)(ii)
                  below).

                           (ii)  Prepayments  on Senior  Notes  and 2003  Senior
                  Notes. Contemporaneously with any prepayment of (i) the Senior
                  Notes pursuant to Section 8.3 of the Note Purchase  Agreements
                  or (ii) the 2003 Senior  Notes  pursuant to Section 8.3 of the
                  2003 Note  Purchase  Agreement,  the  Borrowers  shall  make a
                  principal  payment  to the  Administrative  Agent in an amount

                                       38
<PAGE>

                  necessary to prepay the Loans on a pro rata basis according to
                  the aggregate  unpaid principal amount of the Senior Notes and
                  the 2003  Senior  Notes  and the  aggregate  unpaid  principal
                  amount of the Loans.

                           (iii)   Application  of   Prepayments.   All  amounts
                  required to be paid  pursuant to this Section  3.3(b) shall be
                  applied first to Revolving  Loans,  second to Swingline  Loans
                  and  third to a cash  collateral  account  in  respect  of L/C
                  Obligations.  Within  the  foregoing  parameters,  prepayments
                  shall  be  applied  first  to  Base  Rate  Loans  and  then to
                  Eurodollar   Loans  in  direct   order  of   Interest   Period
                  maturities.  All  prepayments  hereunder  shall be  subject to
                  Section  3.14 and  shall be  accompanied  by  interest  on the
                  principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

         3.4      TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT.

                  (a)  Voluntary  Reduction.  The  Parent  may from time to time
         permanently  reduce or  terminate  (without  premium  or  penalty)  the
         Revolving  Committed  Amount in whole or in part (in minimum  aggregate
         amounts of $5,000,000 or in integral  multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
         thereof (or, if less, the full remaining  amount of the then applicable
         Revolving  Committed  Amount)) upon three  Business Days' prior written
         notice to the Administrative Agent; provided, that, no such termination
         or reduction  shall be made which would cause the sum of the  aggregate
         outstanding  principal amount of the Revolving Loans plus the aggregate
         amount of outstanding  L/C Obligations  plus the aggregate  outstanding
         principal  amount of Swingline Loans to exceed the Revolving  Committed
         Amount,  unless,  concurrently with such termination or reduction,  the
         Loans are repaid to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess.  Any
         reduction in (or termination of) the Revolving  Committed  Amount shall
         be permanent and may not be reinstated.  The Administrative Agent shall
         promptly notify each affected  Lender of receipt by the  Administrative
         Agent of any notice from the Parent pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).

                  (b)      Mandatory Reduction.

                           (i)  Asset  Dispositions.  To the  extent  the  asset
                  dispositions  permitted  by  Section  8.5(e)  of  this  Credit
                  Agreement  exceed  $50,000,000  in the  aggregate  during  the
                  period  from  the  Closing  Date  to the  Maturity  Date,  the
                  Revolving   Committed   Amount   shall  be   immediately   and
                  permanently  reduced  by the  amount by which  such  permitted
                  asset dispositions  exceed $50,000,000 in the aggregate during
                  such period.

                           (ii)  Sale   Leasebacks.   To  the  extent  the  sale
                  leaseback  transactions  permitted hereunder exceed $6,000,000
                  in  the  aggregate  during  any  fiscal  year,  the  Revolving
                  Committed Amount shall be immediately and permanently  reduced
                  by the amount by which such sale leaseback transactions exceed
                  $6,000,000 in the aggregate during any fiscal year.

                           (iii)  Prepayments  on Senior  Notes and 2003  Senior
                  Notes.  Immediately  upon the  occurrence  of any voluntary or
                  optional  prepayment  of (i)  the  Senior  Notes  pursuant  to
                  Section 8.2 of the Note  Purchase  Agreements or (ii) the 2003
                  Senior Notes pursuant to Section 8.2 of the 2003 Note Purchase
                  Agreement, the Revolving Committed Amount shall be permanently
                  reduced on a pro rata basis according to the aggregate  unpaid
                  principal amount of the Senior Notes and the 2003 Senior Notes
                  and the amount of the Revolving  Committed  Amount on the date
                  of such prepayment.

                                       39
<PAGE>

                           (iv)  Notification.  The  Administrative  Agent shall
                  promptly  notify the Lenders of any reduction of the Revolving
                  Committed Amount pursuant to this Section 3.4(b).

         3.5      FEES.

                  (a) Unused Fees. In consideration  of the Revolving  Committed
         Amount being made  available by the Lenders  hereunder,  the  Borrowers
         agree to pay to the  Administrative  Agent, for the pro rata benefit of
         each  Lender  (based  on  each  Lender's   Revolving  Loan   Commitment
         Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount), a per annum fee equal to
         the  Applicable  Percentage  for Unused Fees  multiplied  by the Unused
         Commitment  (the  "Unused  Fees").  The Unused  Fees shall  commence to
         accrue on the  Closing  Date and shall be due and payable in arrears on
         the last Business Day of each fiscal  quarter of the Parent (as well as
         on the  Maturity  Date and on any date  that  the  Revolving  Committed
         Amount is  reduced)  for the fiscal  quarter  then  ending (or  portion
         thereof),  beginning  with the first of such  dates to occur  after the
         Closing  Date.  For purposes of  computation  of the Unused  Fees,  the
         Swingline Loans shall not be counted toward or considered  usage of the
         Revolving Committed Amount.

                  (b) Letter of Credit Fees. In consideration of the issuance of
         Letters of Credit hereunder,  the Borrowers agree to pay to the Issuing
         Lender for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders  (based on each Lender's
         Revolving  Loan  Commitment   Percentage  of  the  Revolving  Committed
         Amount),  a per annum fee (the  "Letter of Credit  Fees")  equal to the
         Applicable Percentage for the Letter of Credit Fees on the actual daily
         amount  available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit from the
         date of issuance to the date of  expiration.  The Letter of Credit Fees
         shall  commence  to  accrue  on the  Closing  Date and shall be due and
         payable in arrears on the last  Business Day of each fiscal  quarter of
         the Parent  (as well as on the  Maturity  Date) for the fiscal  quarter
         then  ending (or  portion  thereof),  beginning  with the first of such
         dates to occur after the Closing Date.

                  (c) Issuing  Lender Fees.  In addition to the Letter of Credit
         Fees payable  pursuant to subsection (b) above, the Borrowers shall pay
         to the Issuing Lender for its own account, without sharing by the other
         Lenders,  (i) a letter  of credit  fronting  fee equal to 0.125% of the
         face amount of each Letter of Credit, such fee to be due and payable in
         arrears on the last  Business Day of each fiscal  quarter of the Parent
         (as well as on the  Maturity  Date) for the fiscal  quarter then ending
         and for the Letters of Credit  issued  during  such fiscal  quarter and
         (ii) the customary  charges from time to time to the Issuing Lender for
         its  services in  connection  with the  issuance,  amendment,  payment,
         transfer, administration,  cancellation and conversion of, and drawings
         under, Letters of Credit.

                  (d)  Administrative  Fees.  The  Parent  agrees  to pay to the
         Administrative  Agent, for its own account, an annual fee in accordance
         with the terms of the Administrative Agent Fee Letter.

         3.6      PAYMENT IN FULL AT MATURITY.

         On the Maturity Date, the entire  outstanding  principal balance of all
Revolving  Loans,  all Swingline  Loans and all L/C  Obligations,  together with
accrued but unpaid interest and all other sums owing with respect thereto, shall
be due and payable in full, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

         3.7      COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES.

                  (a) Except for Base Rate Loans,  in which case interest  shall
         be  computed  on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year as the case may be,
         all  computations  of interest and fees hereunder  shall be made on the
         basis of the  actual  number of days  elapsed  over a year of 360 days.
         Interest  shall  accrue  from and  include  the date of  borrowing  (or
         continuation or conversion) but exclude the date of payment.

                  (b) It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit  Parties to
         conform to and contract in strict  compliance with applicable usury law
         from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the
         Borrowers are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph  which
         shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or
         hereafter  arising and whether  written or oral.  In no way, nor in any
         event or  contingency  (including  but not  limited  to  prepayment  or
         acceleration  of the  maturity of any  obligation),  shall the interest
         taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit
         Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious
         amount   permissible  under  applicable  law.  If,  from  any  possible
         construction  of any of the  Credit  Documents  or any other  document,
         interest   would   otherwise  be  payable  in  excess  of  the  maximum
         nonusurious  amount,  any such  construction  shall be  subject  to the
         provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be  automatically
         reduced to the maximum  nonusurious  amount  permitted under applicable
         law,  without  the  necessity  of  execution  of any  amendment  or new
         document.  If any Lender shall ever receive  anything of value which is
         characterized  as interest on the Loans under  applicable law and which
         would,  apart from this  provision,  be in excess of the maximum lawful
         amount,  an amount equal to the amount which would have been  excessive
         interest  shall,  without  penalty,  be applied to the reduction of the
         principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest,
         or refunded to the  Borrowers or the other payor  thereof if and to the
         extent such amount which would have been excessive  exceeds such unpaid
         principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand payment of the Loans
         or any other indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does
         not include the right to accelerate  the payment of any interest  which
         has not otherwise  accrued on the date of such demand,  and the Lenders
         do not intend to charge or receive any  unearned  interest in the event
         of such demand.  All interest  paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders
         with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent  permitted by applicable
         law, be amortized,  prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full
         stated term  (including  any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that
         the amount of interest on account of such  indebtedness does not exceed
         the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.

         3.8      SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, except to the extent otherwise
provided herein, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of
any Loan,  unreimbursed drawing with respect to any L/C Obligations or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff,  banker's lien or  counterclaim,  or pursuant to a secured
claim under  Section 506 of the  Bankruptcy  Code or other  security or interest
arising from, or in lieu of, such secured  claim,  received by such Lender under
any applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency or other similar law or otherwise,  or by
any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for
in this Credit  Agreement,  such Lender  shall  promptly pay in cash or purchase
from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans, L/C Obligations, and other
obligations in such amounts,  and make such other adjustments from time to time,
as shall  be  equitable  to the end  that all  Lenders  share  such  payment  in
accordance with their  respective  ratable shares as provided for in this Credit
Agreement.  The  Lenders  further  agree among  themselves  that if payment to a
Lender  obtained  by such  Lender  through  the  exercise  of a right of setoff,
banker's lien,  counterclaim  or other event as aforesaid  shall be rescinded or
must  otherwise be restored,  each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of

                                       41
<PAGE>

such  payment  shall,  by payment  in cash or a  repurchase  of a  participation
theretofore  sold,  return its share of that benefit (together with its share of
any accrued  interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment
shall have been rescinded or otherwise  restored.  The Credit Parties agree that
any  Lender so  purchasing  such a  participation  may,  to the  fullest  extent
permitted by law,  exercise all rights of payment,  including  setoff,  banker's
lien or  counterclaim,  with respect to such  participation  as fully as if such
Lender were a holder of such Loan,  L/C  Obligation  or other  obligation in the
amount of such  participation.  Except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this
Credit  Agreement,  if any  Lender  shall  fail to remit to the any Agent or any
other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to such Agent or such other Lender
pursuant to this  Credit  Agreement  on the date when such  amount is due,  such
payments  shall be made together  with  interest  thereon for each date from the
date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to such Agent or such
other  Lender,  if paid within two Business Days of the date when such amount is
due,  at a rate per annum equal to the Federal  Funds Rate and  thereafter  at a
rate per  annum  equal to the Base  Rate.  If under any  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law, any Lender  receives a secured claim in lieu of
a setoff to which this Section 3.8  applies,  such Lender  shall,  to the extent
practicable,  exercise its rights in respect of such  secured  claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the
benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         3.9      CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                  (a) If, after the date hereof,  any Lender has determined that
         the  adoption or the  becoming  effective  of, or any change in, or any
         change by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency
         charged  with  the  interpretation  or  administration  thereof  in the
         interpretation  or  administration  of,  any  applicable  law,  rule or
         regulation regarding capital adequacy, or compliance by such Lender, or
         its parent corporation, with any request or directive regarding capital
         adequacy  (whether  or not  having  the  force  of  law)  of  any  such
         authority,  central bank or  comparable  agency,  has or would have the
         effect  of  reducing  the rate of return on such  Lender's  (or  parent
         corporation's) capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
         obligations  hereunder to a level below that which such Lender,  or its
         parent  corporation,   could  have  achieved  but  for  such  adoption,
         effectiveness,  change or compliance  (taking into  consideration  such
         Lender's  (or parent  corporation's)  policies  with respect to capital
         adequacy),  then,  upon  written  notice from such Lender to the Parent
         (together  with  documentation  supporting  such claim;  provided  that
         failure to provide such documentation shall not impair a Lender's claim
         hereunder), the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such
         additional  amount or  amounts  as will  compensate  such  Lender on an
         after-tax  basis (after taking into account  applicable  deductions and
         credits in respect of the amount indemnified) for such reduction.  Each
         determination  by any such Lender of amounts  owing under this  Section
         shall,  absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties
         hereto.  This  covenant  shall survive the  termination  of this Credit
         Agreement  and the payment of the Loans and all other  amounts  payable
         hereunder.

                  (b) Each  Lender  shall  promptly  notify  the  Parent and the
         Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge,  occurring
         after the Closing Date,  which will entitle such Lender to compensation
         pursuant to this Section and will designate a different  lending office
         if such  designation  will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
         such  compensation  and will not,  in the  reasonable  judgment of such
         Lender,  be  otherwise  disadvantageous  to  it.  Any  Lender  claiming
         compensation  under this  Section  shall  furnish to the Parent and the
         Administrative Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or
         amounts to be paid to it  hereunder  which shall be  conclusive  in the
         absence of manifest error. In determining such amount,  such Lender may
         use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

                                       42

         3.10     INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE.

         If prior to the first day of any Interest  Period,  the  Administrative
Agent  shall  have  determined  in good  faith  (which  determination  shall  be
conclusive  and binding upon the  Borrowers)  that,  by reason of  circumstances
affecting the relevant  market,  adequate and reasonable  means do not exist for
ascertaining  the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period,  the  Administrative
Agent shall give  telecopy or  telephonic  notice  thereof to the Parent and the
Lenders as soon as  practicable  thereafter,  and will also give prompt  written
notice to the Parent when such  conditions  no longer  exist.  If such notice is
given (a) any  Eurodollar  Loans  requested  to be made on the first day of such
Interest  Period  shall be made as Base Rate  Loans,  (b) any Loans that were to
have been converted on the first day of such Interest  Period to or continued as
Eurodollar  Loans shall be  converted to or continued as Base Rate Loans and (c)
any outstanding  Eurodollar  Loans shall be converted,  on the first day of such
Interest  Period,  to Base Rate  Loans.  Until such notice is  withdrawn  by the
Administrative  Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as
such,  nor shall the  Borrowers  have the right to  convert  Base Rate  Loans to
Eurodollar Loans.

         3.11     ILLEGALITY.

         Notwithstanding  any other provision  herein, if the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof
occurring  after the Closing  Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make
or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement,  (a) such
Lender shall  promptly give written notice of such  circumstances  to the Parent
and the  Administrative  Agent (which  notice shall be withdrawn  whenever  such
circumstances  no longer exist),  (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to
make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Base Rate
Loan to Eurodollar  Loans shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time as it
shall no longer be  unlawful  for such  Lender  to make or  maintain  Eurodollar
Loans,  such Lender shall then have a  commitment  only to make a Base Rate Loan
when a Eurodollar Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding
as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans
on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such  Loans or within  such  earlier  period  as  required  by law.  If any such
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the
then current  Interest Period with respect  thereto,  the Borrowers shall pay to
such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.14.

         3.12     REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

         If the  adoption of or any change in any  Requirement  of Law or in the
interpretation or application thereof applicable to any Lender, or compliance by
any Lender  with any  request or  directive  (whether or not having the force of
law) from any central bank or other  Governmental  Authority,  in each case made
subsequent  to the  Closing  Date (or,  if later,  the date on which such Lender
becomes a Lender):

                  (a)  shall  subject  such  Lender  to  any  tax  of  any  kind
         whatsoever with respect to any Letter of Credit,  any Eurodollar  Loans
         made by it or its obligation to make  Eurodollar  Loans,  or change the
         basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except
         for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 3.13 (including  Non-Excluded
         Taxes imposed  solely by reason of any failure of such Lender to comply
         with its  obligations  under  Section  3.13(b))  and  changes  in taxes
         measured by or imposed upon the overall net income, or franchise taxes,
         branch taxes,  taxes on doing business or taxes on capital or net worth
         (imposed  in  lieu of such  net  income  tax),  of such  Lender  or its
         applicable lending office, branch, or any affiliate thereof);

                  (b) shall  impose,  modify  or hold  applicable  any  reserve,
         special deposit,  compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held  by,  deposits  or other  liabilities  in or for the  account  of,

                                       43
<PAGE>

         advances,  loans  or  other  extensions  of  credit  by,  or any  other
         acquisition  of  funds  by,  any  office  of such  Lender  which is not
         otherwise   included  in  the  determination  of  the  Eurodollar  Rate
         hereunder; or

                  (c) shall impose on such Lender any other condition (excluding
         any tax of any kind whatsoever);

and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing  or  maintaining  Eurodollar  Loans or  issuing or  participating  in
Letters  of Credit or to reduce  any  amount  receivable  hereunder  in  respect
thereof,  then,  in any such case,  upon notice to the Parent from such  Lender,
through the Administrative Agent, in accordance herewith, the Borrowers shall be
obligated to promptly pay such Lender,  upon its demand,  any additional amounts
necessary to  compensate  such Lender on an after-tax  basis (after  taking into
account applicable  deductions and credits in respect of the amount indemnified)
for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable, provided that, in any such
case,  the  Borrowers  may elect to convert  the  Eurodollar  Loans made by such
Lender hereunder to Base Rate Loans by giving the Administrative  Agent at least
one Business  Day's notice of such election,  in which case the Borrowers  shall
promptly pay to such Lender, upon demand, without duplication,  such amounts, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.14. If any Lender becomes entitled
to claim any additional  amounts pursuant to this Section 3.12, it shall provide
prompt  notice  thereof  to  the  Parent,   through  the  Administrative  Agent,
certifying  (x)  that  one of the  events  described  in this  Section  3.12 has
occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to
the increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such event and (z) as to the
additional amount demanded by such Lender and a reasonably detailed  explanation
of the  calculation  thereof.  Such a certificate as to any  additional  amounts
payable  pursuant to this  Section 3.12  submitted  by such Lender,  through the
Administrative  Agent,  to the Parent  shall be  conclusive  and  binding on the
parties hereto in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Credit  Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

         3.13     TAXES.

                  (a)  Payments  Free of Taxes.  Any and all  payments  by or on
         account of any obligation of the respective Borrower hereunder or under
         any other Credit  Document  shall be made free and clear of and without
         reduction  or  withholding  for any  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes,
         provided  that  if  the  applicable   Borrower  shall  be  required  by
         applicable  law to deduct any  Indemnified  Taxes  (including any Other
         Taxes) from such payments,  then (i) the sum payable shall be increased
         as necessary so that after  making all required  deductions  (including
         deductions  applicable to  additional  sums payable under this Section)
         the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be,
         receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had no such
         deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and
         (iii) such  Borrower  shall timely pay the full amount  deducted to the
         relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers.  Without limiting
         the provisions of subsection (a) above,  each Borrower shall timely pay
         any Other Taxes to the relevant  Governmental  Authority in  accordance
         with applicable law.

                  (c)  Indemnification  by the  Borrower.  Each  Borrower  shall
         indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender,
         within  10 days  after  demand  therefor,  for the full  amount  of any
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including  Indemnified Taxes or Other
         Taxes imposed or asserted on or  attributable  to amounts payable under

                                       44
<PAGE>

         this  Section)  paid by the  Administrative  Agent,  such Lender or the
         Issuing  Lender,  as the case may be, and any  penalties,  interest and
         reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,  whether
         or not such Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
         imposed  or  asserted  by  the  relevant  Governmental   Authority.   A
         certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability  delivered to
         a  Borrower  by a  Lender  or the  Issuing  Lender  (with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf
         or on behalf of a Lender or the  Issuing  Lender,  shall be  conclusive
         absent manifest error.

                  (d) Evidence of  Payments.  As soon as  practicable  after any
         payment  of  Indemnified  Taxes or Other  Taxes  by any  Borrower  to a
         Governmental   Authority,   such   Borrower   shall   deliver   to  the
         Administrative  Agent the  original  or a  certified  copy of a receipt
         issued by such Governmental  Authority  evidencing such payment, a copy
         of the return  reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
         reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Status of Lenders.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to
         an exemption from or reduction of withholding  tax under the law of the
         jurisdiction  in which the Parent is resident for tax purposes,  or any
         treaty to which such  jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments
         hereunder  or under any other  Credit  Document  shall  deliver  to the
         Parent (with a copy to the Administrative  Agent), at the time or times
         prescribed by applicable  law or reasonably  requested by the Parent or
         the   Administrative   Agent,  such  properly  completed  and  executed
         documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments
         to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In
         addition,  any Lender, if requested by the Parent or the Administrative
         Agent, shall deliver such other documentation  prescribed by applicable
         law or reasonably  requested by the Parent or the Administrative  Agent
         as will  enable the  Parent or the  Administrative  Agent to  determine
         whether  or not  such  Lender  is  subject  to  backup  withholding  or
         information reporting requirements.

                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event
         that such  Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United  States,
         any Foreign  Lender shall deliver to the Parent and the  Administrative
         Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient)
         on or prior to the date on which such Foreign  Lender  becomes a Lender
         under this Credit  Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
         request of the  Parent or the  Administrative  Agent,  but only if such
         Foreign  Lender  is  legally  entitled  to do  so),  whichever  of  the
         following is applicable:

                           (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service
                  Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax
                  treaty to which the United States is a party,

                           (ii)  duly  completed   copies  of  Internal  Revenue
                  Service Form W-8ECI,

                           (iii) in the case of a Foreign  Lender  claiming  the
                  benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section
                  881(c) of the Code,  (x) a certificate to the effect that such
                  Foreign  Lender  is not (A) a "bank"  within  the  meaning  of
                  section   881(c)(3)(A)   of  the  Code,   (B)  a  "10  percent
                  shareholder" of the applicable  Borrower within the meaning of
                  section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign
                  corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and
                  (y) duly  completed  copies of Internal  Revenue  Service Form
                  W-8BEN, or

                           (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a
                  basis for  claiming  exemption  from or a reduction  in United
                  States Federal  withholding  tax duly completed  together with

                                       45
<PAGE>

                  such  supplementary  documentation  as  may be  prescribed  by
                  applicable   law  to  permit  the  Parent  to  determine   the
                  withholding or deduction required to be made.

                  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent,
         any Lender or the Issuing Lender  determines,  in its sole  discretion,
         that it has  received a refund of any Taxes or Other  Taxes as to which
         it has been  indemnified  by a  Borrower  or with  respect to which any
         Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall
         pay to such  Borrower  an amount  equal to such refund (but only to the
         extent of indemnity  payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such
         Borrower  under this  Section  with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes
         giving rise to such refund),  net of all out-of-pocket  expenses of the
         Administrative  Agent,  such Lender or the Issuing Lender,  as the case
         may be, and  without  interest  (other  than any  interest  paid by the
         relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),  provided
         that such Borrower,  upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such
         Lender or the Issuing  Lender,  agrees to repay the amount paid over to
         such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
         the relevant Governmental  Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such
         Lender or the  Issuing  Lender in the event the  Administrative  Agent,
         such Lender or the  Issuing  Lender is required to repay such refund to
         such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to
         require the  Administrative  Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender to
         make  available its tax returns (or any other  information  relating to
         its taxes  that it deems  confidential)  to any  Borrower  or any other
         Person.

         3.14     COMPENSATION.

         The Credit  Parties  promise to indemnify  each Lender and to hold each
Lender  harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur
as a  consequence  of (a)  default by any  Borrower  in making a  borrowing  of,
conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after a Borrower has given a
notice  requesting  the same in  accordance  with the  provisions of this Credit
Agreement,  (b) default by any Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar
Loan  after a  Borrower  has  given a  notice  thereof  in  accordance  with the
provisions  of this  Credit  Agreement  and (c) the  making of a  prepayment  of
Eurodollar  Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest  Period with
respect  thereto.  Such  indemnification  may include an amount equal to (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid,  or not so
borrowed,  converted  or  continued,  for  the  period  from  the  date  of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow,  convert or continue to the last day of
the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,  convert
or continue,  the Interest  Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the  applicable  rate of interest  for such  Eurodollar
Loans  provided  for  herein  (excluding,  however,  the  Applicable  Percentage
included  therein,  if any)  minus (ii) the amount of  interest  (as  reasonably
determined  by such  Lender)  which  would have  accrued to such  Lender on such
amount by placing  such amount on deposit for a  comparable  period with leading
banks in the interbank  Eurodollar  market. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the  termination  of this Credit  Agreement and the payment of the Loans
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         3.15     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a)  Each  Lender  shall   maintain  an  account  or  accounts
         evidencing  each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrowers from time to
         time,  including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
         to such  Lender  from time to time under this  Credit  Agreement.  Each
         Lender will make  reasonable  efforts to maintain  the  accuracy of its
         account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from
         time to time, as necessary.

                                       46
<PAGE>

                  (b) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  the  Register
         pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
         Register and  subaccounts  (taken  together)  shall be recorded (i) the
         amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder,  (ii) the
         amount of any  principal  or interest  due and payable or to become due
         and payable to each Lender  hereunder,  and (iii) the amount of any sum
         received by the Administrative  Agent hereunder from or for the account
         of  the  Borrowers  and  each  Lender's  share  thereof,  if  any.  The
         Administrative  Agent  will make  reasonable  efforts to  maintain  the
         accuracy of the subaccounts  referred to in the preceding  sentence and
         to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.

                  (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts
         maintained  pursuant to  subsection  (b) of this Section 3.15 (and,  if
         consistent  with the entries of the  Administrative  Agent,  subsection
         (a)) shall be prima facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of the
         obligations of the Borrowers therein recorded;  provided, however, that
         the failure of any Lender or the Administrative  Agent to maintain such
         account, such Register, or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error
         therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers
         to repay the Loans  made by such  Lender in  accordance  with the terms
         hereof.


                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1      GUARANTY OF PAYMENT.

         Subject to Section 4.7 below,  each of the Guarantors  hereby,  jointly
and  severally,  unconditionally  guarantees to each Lender,  each  Affiliate of
Lender that enters into a Hedging  Agreement  and the  Administrative  Agent the
prompt  payment of the Credit  Party  Obligations  in full when due  (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise).  This
Guaranty  is a guaranty  of payment and not of  collection  and is a  continuing
guaranty and shall apply to all Credit Party Obligations whenever arising.

         4.2      OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The   obligations  of  the   Guarantors   hereunder  are  absolute  and
unconditional,  irrespective of the value, genuineness,  validity, regularity or
enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or the Hedging Agreements,  or any
other  agreement  or  instrument  referred  to therein,  to the  fullest  extent
permitted by applicable law,  irrespective of any other circumstance  whatsoever
which might otherwise  constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor. Each Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty may be enforced by
the Lenders  without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any
other  security or  collateral  and without the  necessity at any time of having
recourse to the Notes or any other of the Credit Documents or any collateral, if
any,  hereafter  securing the Credit  Party  Obligations  or otherwise  and each
Guarantor  hereby waives the right to require the Lenders to proceed against the
Borrowers  or any other  Person  (including  a  co-guarantor)  or to require the
Lenders to pursue any other  remedy or enforce any other right.  Each  Guarantor
further  agrees  that  it  shall  have  no  right  of  subrogation,   indemnity,
reimbursement or contribution against any Borrower or any other Guarantor of the
Credit Party Obligations for amounts paid under this Guaranty until such time as
the Lenders (and any  Affiliates of Lenders  entering  into Hedging  Agreements)
have been paid in full,  all  Commitments  under the Credit  Agreement have been
terminated  and no  Person or  Governmental  Authority  shall  have any right to
request any return or reimbursement of funds from the Lenders in connection with

                                       47
<PAGE>

monies received under the Credit  Documents.  Each Guarantor further agrees that
nothing  contained  herein shall  prevent the Lenders from suing on the Notes or
any  of  the  other  Credit  Documents  or any  of  the  Hedging  Agreements  or
foreclosing its security interest in or Lien on any collateral, if any, securing
the Credit Party Obligations or from exercising any other rights available to it
under this Credit Agreement,  the Notes, any other of the Credit  Documents,  or
any  other  instrument  of  security,  if any,  and the  exercise  of any of the
aforesaid  rights and the completion of any  foreclosure  proceedings  shall not
constitute a discharge of any of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder; it being
the purpose and intent of each Guarantor that its obligations hereunder shall be
absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Neither
any  Guarantor's  obligations  under  this  Guaranty  nor  any  remedy  for  the
enforcement  thereof  shall be  impaired,  modified,  changed or released in any
manner whatsoever by an impairment,  modification, change, release or limitation
of the liability of any Borrower or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of
any Borrower. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension  or accrual of any of the Credit  Party  Obligations  and notice of or
proof of reliance of by any Agent or any Lender upon this guaranty or acceptance
of  this  guaranty.  The  Credit  Party  Obligations,  and  any of  them,  shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed,
extended,  amended or waived,  in  reliance  upon this  guaranty.  All  dealings
between any Borrower and any of the Guarantors,  on the one hand, and the Agents
and the Lenders, on the other hand,  likewise shall be conclusively  presumed to
have been had or  consummated  in reliance upon this  guaranty.  The  Guarantors
further agree to all rights of set-off as set forth in Section 11.2.

         4.3      MODIFICATIONS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that (a) all or any part of the Collateral now or
hereafter  held for the Credit  Party  Obligations,  if any,  may be  exchanged,
compromised or surrendered from time to time; (b) the Lenders shall not have any
obligation to protect,  perfect,  secure or insure any such security  interests,
liens or  encumbrances  now or  hereafter  held,  if any,  for the Credit  Party
Obligations or the properties subject thereto;  (c) the time or place of payment
of the Credit Party Obligations may be changed or extended, in whole or in part,
to a time certain or otherwise,  and may be renewed or accelerated,  in whole or
in part;  (d) any  Borrower  and any other party  liable for  payment  under the
Credit Documents may be granted indulgences generally; (e) any of the provisions
of the Notes or any of the other Credit  Documents  may be modified,  amended or
waived;  (f) any party  (including  any  co-guarantor)  liable  for the  payment
thereof may be granted  indulgences or be released;  and (g) any deposit balance
for the credit of any  Borrower or any other party liable for the payment of the
Credit Party  Obligations or liable upon any security  therefor may be released,
in whole or in part,  at,  before or after the stated,  extended or  accelerated
maturity  of the Credit  Party  Obligations,  all  without  notice to or further
assent by such Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon,  notwithstanding any
such  exchange,   compromise,   surrender,   extension,  renewal,  acceleration,
modification, indulgence or release.

         4.4      WAIVER OF RIGHTS.

         Each  Guarantor  expressly  waives to the fullest  extent  permitted by
applicable  law: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty by the Lenders and of
all  extensions of credit to any Borrower by the Lenders;  (b)  presentment  and
demand for payment or  performance of any of the Credit Party  Obligations;  (c)
protest and notice of dishonor or of default (except as specifically required in
the Credit  Agreement)  with  respect to the Credit  Party  Obligations  or with
respect to any security therefor; (d) notice of the Lenders obtaining, amending,
substituting for, releasing, waiving or modifying any security interest, lien or
encumbrance,  if any, hereafter  securing the Credit Party  Obligations,  or the
Lenders'  subordinating,  compromising,  discharging  or releasing such security
interests,  liens or  encumbrances,  if any; (e) all other notices to which such
Guarantor  might  otherwise be entitled;  and (f) demand for payment  under this
Guaranty.

<PAGE>

         4.5      REINSTATEMENT.

         The  obligations  of the  Guarantors  under  this  Section  4 shall  be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf  of any  Person in  respect  of the  Credit  Party  Obligations  is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations,   whether  as  a  result  of  any   proceedings  in  bankruptcy  or
reorganization  or otherwise,  and each Guarantor  agrees that it will indemnify
the Agents and each Lender  promptly  upon demand for all  reasonable  costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by
an Agent or such  Lender in  connection  with such  rescission  or  restoration,
including  any such costs and expenses  incurred in defending  against any claim
alleging  that such payment  constituted a  preference,  fraudulent  transfer or
similar  payment  under any  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or similar  law.  Upon the
request of the Parent, an Agent or a Lender will provide written support for any
claim made  pursuant to this Section 4.5;  provided that failure to provide such
written support shall not impair a Lender's or an Agent's claim hereunder.

         4.6      REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors  agree that, to the fullest extent  permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors,  on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on the
other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable  as  provided  in  Section  9.2 (and  shall  be  deemed  to have  become
automatically  due and payable in the  circumstances  provided  in Section  9.2)
notwithstanding  any  stay,  injunction  or other  prohibition  preventing  such
declaration  (or  preventing  such  Credit  Party   Obligations   from  becoming
automatically  due and  payable)  as against any other  Person and that,  in the
event of such declaration (or such Credit Party Obligations being deemed to have
become automatically due and payable), such Credit Party Obligations (whether or
not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith  become due and payable
by the Guarantors.  The Guarantors  acknowledge and agree that their obligations
hereunder are secured in accordance  with the terms of the Collateral  Documents
and that the Lenders may exercise their remedies  thereunder in accordance  with
the terms thereof.

         4.7      LIMITATION OF GUARANTY.

         Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary  contained  herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents,  the obligations of each Guarantor under this
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be limited to an aggregate
amount  equal to the  largest  amount  that  would not render  such  obligations
subject to avoidance  under the Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable  provisions
of any applicable state law.

         4.8      RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The  Guarantors  hereby agree as among  themselves  that, in connection
with payments made hereunder,  each Guarantor shall have a right of contribution
from each other Guarantor in accordance  with applicable Law. Such  contribution
rights shall be subordinate  and subject in right of payment to the Credit Party
Obligations   until  such  time  as  the  Credit  Party  Obligations  have  been
irrevocably paid in full and the commitments relating thereto shall have expired
or  been  terminated,  and  none  of the  Guarantors  shall  exercise  any  such
contribution  rights until the Credit Party  Obligations  have been  irrevocably
paid in full and the  commitments  relating  thereto  shall have expired or been
terminated.

         the Parent shall immediately notify the Collateral Agent of same.

                  (b) Each Credit Party shall  (within 30 days of such  request)
         take such action,  as reasonably  requested by the Collateral Agent and
         at its own expense, to ensure that the Secured Parties have a perfected
         Lien in all Collateral of the Credit Parties as set forth in the Pledge

Domestic  Subsidiaries  and (d) for  general  corporate  purposes  of the Credit
Parties (including,  without limitation,  the repurchase of Capital Stock of the
Parent  pursuant  to  the  Share  Repurchase  Program  to the  extent  permitted

         satisfactory  to  the  Collateral  Agent  and  (d)  provide  (i) to the
         Administrative  Agent a new  Schedule  6.15  which  shall  reflect  the

of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of
the  United  States,  the  obligation  of  each  Lender  to make  Loans  and any
obligation  of  the  Issuing  Lenders  to  make  L/C  Credit   Extensions  shall
automatically  terminate,  the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding  Loans

                                       75
<PAGE>

and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall  automatically  become due
and payable,  and the obligation of the Borrowers to Cash  Collateralize the L/C
Obligations as aforesaid  shall  automatically  become  effective,  in each case
without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         9.3      ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this Credit  Agreement,  after
the  occurrence and during the  continuance of an Event of Default,  all amounts
collected  or  received  by any  Agent  or any  Lender  on  account  of  amounts
outstanding  under any of the Credit  Documents or in respect of the  Collateral
shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

                  FIRST,  to the payment of all reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs
         and expenses (including without limitation  reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of the Agents or any of the Lenders in  connection  with  enforcing the
         rights of the Lenders  under the Credit  Documents  and any  protective
         advances  made by any Agent or any of the Lenders  with  respect to the
         Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agents, the Issuing
         Lender or any Lender;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all accrued  interest  payable to the
         Lenders  hereunder  and  all  other   obligations   (other  than  those
         obligations to be paid pursuant to clause  "FOURTH"  below) which shall
         have become due and payable  under the Credit  Documents and not repaid
         pursuant to clauses "FIRST" and "SECOND" above;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding  principal amount of
         the Loans and  unreimbursed  drawings  under Letters of Credit,  to the
         payment or cash  collateralization  of the  outstanding L/C Obligations
         and to any  principal  amounts  outstanding  under  Hedging  Agreements
         between a Credit Party and a Lender, pro rata as set forth below; and

                  FIFTH,  the payment of the surplus,  if any, to whoever may be
         lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying  out the  foregoing,  (a) amounts  received  shall be applied in the
numerical  order  provided  until  exhausted  prior to  application  to the next
succeeding  category;  (b) each of the Lenders  shall receive an amount equal to
its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans, L/C
Obligations and obligations  under Hedging  Agreements held by such Lender bears
to the aggregate then outstanding  Loans, L/C Obligations and obligations  under
Hedging  Agreements) of amounts  available to be applied;  and (c) to the extent
that any amounts  available for  distribution  pursuant to clause "FOURTH" above
are  attributable  to the issued but undrawn  amount of  outstanding  Letters of
Credit,  such  amounts  shall  be held  by the  Administrative  Agent  in a cash
collateral  account and applied (x) first,  to reimburse the Issuing Lender from
time to time for any  drawings  under  such  Letters  of  Credit  and (y)  then,
following the expiration of all Letters of Credit,  to all other  obligations of
the types  described  in clause  "FOURTH"  above in the manner  provided in this
Section 9.3.

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

         10.1     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORITY.

         (a) Each of the  Lenders  and the  Issuing  Lender  hereby  irrevocably
appoints  Bank of America to act on its behalf as the  Administrative  Agent and
the  Collateral  Agent  hereunder  and  under  the other  Credit  Documents  and
authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent  and the  Collateral  Agent to take  such
actions  on its behalf  and to  exercise  such  powers as are  delegated  to the
Administrative  Agent and the  Collateral  Agent by the terms hereof or thereof,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably  incidental thereto. The
provisions  of this  Section  are solely for the  benefit of the  Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender,  and neither
the  Borrowers  nor any other  Credit  Party  shall have rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of such provisions.

         (b) Each  Lender  hereby  consents  to and  approves  the  terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule 10.1(b).
By execution  hereof,  the Lenders  acknowledge  the terms of the  Intercreditor
Agreement and agree to be bound by the terms  thereof and further  authorize and
direct the  Administrative  Agent to enter into the  Intercreditor  Agreement on
behalf of all the Lenders.

         10.2     RIGHTS AS A LENDER.

         The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its  capacity as a Lender as any other  Lender and may
exercise  the same as though it were not the  Administrative  Agent and the term
"Lender" or "Lenders" shall,  unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the
context  otherwise  requires,  include the Person serving as the  Administrative
Agent hereunder in its individual  capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may
accept  deposits  from,  lend money to, act as the  financial  advisor or in any
other  advisory  capacity for and generally  engage in any kind of business with
any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were
not the Administrative  Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor
to the Lenders.

         10.3     EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

         The  Administrative  Agent and the Collateral  Agent shall not have any
duties or obligations  except those  expressly set forth herein and in the other
Credit  Documents.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent:

                  (a) shall not be subject  to any  fiduciary  or other  implied
         duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

                  (b) shall not have any duty to take any  discretionary  action
         or exercise any  discretionary  powers,  except (i) with respect to the
         Administrative   Agent,   discretionary  rights  and  powers  expressly
         contemplated   hereby  or  by  the  other  Credit  Documents  that  the
         Administrative  Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by
         the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders
         as shall be  expressly  provided  for  herein  or in the  other  Credit
         Documents),  provided  that  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  not  be
         required to take any action that,  in its opinion or the opinion of its
         counsel,  may expose the  Administrative  Agent to liability or that is
         contrary to any Credit Document or applicable law and (ii) with respect
         to the  Collateral  Agent,  discretionary  rights and powers  expressly
         contemplated   hereby  or  by  the  other  Credit  Documents  that  the
         Collateral  Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
         Required  Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as

                                       77
<PAGE>

         shall  be  expressly  provided  for  herein  or  in  the  other  Credit
         Documents), provided that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to
         take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may
         expose the  Collateral  Agent to  liability  or that is contrary to any
         Credit Document or applicable law; and

                  (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the
         other Credit  Documents,  have any duty to  disclose,  and shall not be
         liable for the failure to  disclose,  any  information  relating to the
         Borrowers  or  any of  their  Affiliates  that  is  communicated  to or
         obtained  by the  Person  serving as the  Administrative  Agent and the
         Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

         The  Administrative  Agent shall not be liable for any action  taken or
not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the  Required  Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary,  or as
the Administrative  Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary,  under
the  circumstances  as provided in Sections 11.7 and 9.2) or (ii) in the absence
of its own gross  negligence or willful  misconduct.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall be deemed not to have  knowledge  of any Default  unless and until  notice
describing such Default is given to the  Administrative  Agent by a Borrower,  a
Lender or the Issuing Lender.  The Collateral  Agent shall not be liable for any
action  taken or not taken by it (i) with the  consent or at the  request of the
Required  Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary,  or as the  Collateral  Agent  shall  believe in good faith  shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.7 and 9.2) or (ii)
in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Collateral
Agent  shall be deemed not to have  knowledge  of any  Default  unless and until
notice describing such Default is given to the Collateral Agent by a Borrower, a
Lender or the Issuing Lender.

         The  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  not  be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or  representation  made in or in connection with this Credit Agreement
or any other Credit Document,  (ii) the contents of any  certificate,  report or
other document  delivered  hereunder or thereunder or in connection  herewith or
therewith,  (iii)  the  performance  or  observance  of any  of  the  covenants,
agreements  or other  terms or  conditions  set forth  herein or  therein or the
occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,  enforceability,  effectiveness or
genuineness  of this Credit  Agreement,  any other Credit  Document or any other
agreement,  instrument or document or (v) the  satisfaction of any condition set
forth in Section 5 or elsewhere  herein,  other than to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
Agent, as applicable.

         10.4     RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Each of the Agents shall be entitled to rely upon,  and shall not incur
any liability  for relying  upon,  any notice,  request,  certificate,  consent,
statement,  instrument,  document or other  writing  (including  any  electronic
message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by
it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the
proper  Person.  Each of the Agents also may rely upon any statement  made to it
orally or by  telephone  and  believed  by it to have  been  made by the  proper
Person,  and shall not incur any liability for relying  thereon.  In determining
compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance
of a Letter of Credit,  that by its terms must be fulfilled to the  satisfaction
of a Lender or the Issuing  Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent may presume that
such condition is  satisfactory  to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender
or the Issuing  Lender  prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such

                                       78
<PAGE>

Letter of Credit.  Each of the Agents may consult with legal counsel (who may be
counsel for the Borrowers),  independent  accountants and other experts selected
by it,  and  shall  not be  liable  for any  action  taken or not taken by it in
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         10.5     DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         Each of the Agents may perform  any and all of its duties and  exercise
its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit Document by or through
any one or more sub-agents  appointed by such Agent.  Each of the Agents and any
such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers  by  or  through  their  respective  Related  Parties.   The  exculpatory
provisions of this Section shall apply to any such  sub-agent and to the Related
Parties  of the  Agents  and any  such  sub-agent,  and  shall  apply  to  their
respective   activities  in  connection  with  the  syndication  of  the  credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Agents.

         10.6     RESIGNATION.

         The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation
to the  Lenders,  the Issuing  Lender and the Parent.  Upon  receipt of any such
notice  of  resignation,   the  Required   Lenders  shall  have  the  right,  in
consultation with the Parent, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with
an office in the United States,  or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office
in the United States.  If no such successor  shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such  appointment  within 30 days after
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent gives notice of its  resignation,  then the
retiring  Administrative  Agent  may on behalf of the  Lenders  and the  Issuing
Lender, appoint a successor  Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set
forth above;  provided that if the Administrative  Agent shall notify the Parent
and the Lenders that no qualifying  Person has accepted such  appointment,  then
such  resignation  shall  nonetheless  become  effective in accordance with such
notice and (1) the retiring  Administrative  Agent shall be discharged  from its
duties and obligations  hereunder and under the other Credit  Documents  (except
that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative  Agent on
behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing  Lender under any of the Credit  Documents,
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent  shall  continue  to hold  such  collateral
security until such time as a successor  Administrative  Agent is appointed) and
(2) all payments,  communications and determinations  provided to be made by, to
or through the  Administrative  Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender
and the Issuing Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint
a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the
acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder,  such
successor  shall  succeed to and become  vested with all of the rights,  powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the
retiring  Administrative  Agent shall be  discharged  from all of its duties and
obligations  hereunder  or under  the other  Credit  Documents  (if not  already
discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the
Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its  predecessor  unless  otherwise  agreed  between the  Borrowers  and such
successor.  After the retiring  Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and
under the other Credit  Documents,  the  provisions  of this Section and Section
11.6 shall  continue in effect for the benefit of such  retiring  Administrative
Agent,  its sub-agents and their  respective  Related  Parties in respect of any
actions  taken  or  omitted  to be  taken  by any of  them  while  the  retiring
Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

         Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative  Agent pursuant to
this  Section  shall also  constitute  its  resignation  as  Issuing  Lender and
Swingline  Lender.   Upon  the  acceptance  of  a  successor's   appointment  as
Administrative  Agent hereunder,  (a) such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all of the rights,  powers,  privileges  and duties of the  retiring
Issuing  Lender  and  Swingline  Lender,  (b) the  retiring  Issuing  Lender and
Swingline  Lender shall be discharged  from all of their  respective  duties and

                                       79
<PAGE>

obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, and (c) the successor
Issuing Lender shall issue letters of credit in substitution  for the Letters of
Credit,  if  any,  outstanding  at the  time of such  succession  or make  other
arrangement  satisfactory to the retiring  Issuing Lender to effectively  assume
the  obligations of the retiring  Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of
Credit.

         10.7     NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each  Lender  and  the  Issuing  Lender   acknowledges   that  it  has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or any of
their  Related  Parties and based on such  documents and  information  as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Credit  Agreement.  Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or
any of their Related  Parties and based on such documents and  information as it
shall from time to time deem appropriate,  continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under or based upon this Credit Agreement, any other
Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished  hereunder or
thereunder.

         10.8     AGENTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Arranger listed on
the cover page  hereof  shall not have any  powers,  duties or  responsibilities
under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents,  except in its
capacity,  as applicable,  as the Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, a
Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder.

         10.9     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOF OF CLAIMS.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership,  insolvency,  liquidation,
bankruptcy,  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,  composition  or  other
judicial  proceeding  relative to any Credit  Party,  the  Administrative  Agent
(irrespective  of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then
be due and  payable as herein  expressed  or by  declaration  or  otherwise  and
irrespective of whether the  Administrative  Agent shall have made any demand on
the  Borrowers)  shall  be  entitled  and  empowered,  by  intervention  in such
proceeding or otherwise:

                  (a) to file and  prove a claim  for the  whole  amount  of the
         principal  and interest  owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans,  L/C
         Obligations  and  all  other  Credit  Party  Obligations   (other  than
         obligations under Hedging Agreements to which the Administrative  Agent
         is not a party)  that are  owing  and  unpaid  and to file  such  other
         documents  as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims
         of the  Lenders,  the  Issuing  Lenders  and the  Administrative  Agent
         (including  any  claim  for  the  reasonable  compensation,   expenses,
         disbursements and advances of the Lenders,  the Issuing Lenders and the
         Administrative  Agent and their  respective  agents and counsel and all
         other   amounts  due  the   Lenders,   the  Issuing   Lenders  and  the
         Administrative  Agent  under  Sections  2.2(i)  and (j),  3.1 and 11.6)
         allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                  (b) to  collect  and  receive  any  monies  or other  property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian,  receiver,  assignee,  trustee,  liquidator,  sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial  proceeding is hereby  authorized by
each Lender and each Issuing Lender to make such payments to the  Administrative
Agent  and,  in the event that the  Administrative  Agent  shall  consent to the
making of such payments  directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lender,  to pay

                                       80
<PAGE>

to the  Administrative  Agent any  amount due for the  reasonable  compensation,
expenses,  disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents
and counsel,  and any other amounts due the Administrative  Agent under Sections
3.1 and 11.6.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the  Administrative  Agent
to  authorize  or  consent  to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any
Issuing  Lender  any  plan  of   reorganization,   arrangement,   adjustment  or
composition  affecting the Credit Party  Obligations or the rights of any Lender
or to authorize the Administrative  Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any
Lender in any such proceeding.

                  (a) Notices Generally. Except in the case of notices and other
         communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except
         as  provided  in   subsection   (b)  below),   all  notices  and  other
         communications  provided  for herein  shall be in writing  and shall be
         delivered by hand or overnight courier service,  mailed by certified or
         registered  mail or sent by telecopier as follows,  and all notices and
         other  communications  expressly  permitted  hereunder  to be  given by
         telephone shall be made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

         through electronic  communications to the extent provided in subsection
         (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such subsection (b).

         Administrative  Agent that it is incapable of receiving  notices  under
         such Section by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or a
         Borrower  may,  in its  discretion,  agree to accept  notices and other
         communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
         procedures  approved by it,  provided that approval of such  procedures
         may be limited to particular notices or communications.

         that if such  notice  or other  communication  is not sent  during  the
         normal  business hours of the recipient,  such notice or  communication
         shall be deemed to have been sent at the  opening  of  business  on the
         next business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications
         posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon
         the deemed  receipt by the intended  recipient at its e-mail address as
         described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification  that such notice
         or  communication  is available  and  identifying  the website  address
         therefor.

         Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Lender and the
         Swingline Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number
         for notices and other  communications  hereunder by notice to the other
         parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier or
         telephone  number for notices  and other  communications  hereunder  by
         notice to the  Borrowers,  the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Collateral
         Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender.

                  (d)  Reliance  by  Administrative  Agent,  Issuing  Lender and
         Lenders.  The  Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
         Lender  and the  Lenders  shall  be  entitled  to rely and act upon any
         notices  (including  telephonic Notices of Borrowing and Swingline Loan
         Requests)  purportedly  given by or on behalf of the Borrowers  even if
         (i) such  notices  were not made in a  manner  specified  herein,  were
         incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice
         specified  herein,  or (ii) the terms  thereof,  as  understood  by the
         recipient,  varied from any confirmation  thereof.  The Borrowers shall
         indemnify the  Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
         Lender,  each Lender and the  Related  Parties of each of them from all
         losses,  costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
         such  Person on each  notice  purportedly  given by or on behalf of the
         Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications
         with the  Administrative  Agent may be recorded  by the  Administrative
         Agent,  and  each  of  the  parties  hereto  hereby  consents  to  such
         recording.   All   telephonic   notices   to   and   other   telephonic
         communications  with  the  Collateral  Agent  may  be  recorded  by the
         Collateral  Agent,  and each of the parties  hereto hereby  consents to
         such recording

         11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law
or  otherwise,  and  not by way of  limitation  of any  such  rights,  upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default and the commencement of remedies  described in
Section  9.2,  each  Lender  is  authorized  at any time and from  time to time,
without presentment,  demand,  protest or other notice of any kind (all of which
rights being hereby expressly  waived),  to set-off and to appropriate and apply
any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time
held or owing by such Lender (including, without limitation,  branches, agencies
or  Affiliates  of such  Lender  wherever  located)  to or for the credit or the
account of any Credit Party against  obligations  and liabilities of such Credit
Party to the Lenders  hereunder,  under the Notes, the other Credit Documents or
otherwise, irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall
have made any demand  hereunder and although such  obligations,  liabilities  or
claims,  or any of them,  may be  contingent  or unmatured  or  otherwise  fully
secured, and any such set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default even though such charge is made or entered
on the books of such Lender subsequent thereto.  The Credit Parties hereby agree
that  any  Person  purchasing  a  participation  in the  Loans  and  Commitments
hereunder  pursuant to Section 11.3(e) or 3.8 may exercise all rights of set-off
with  respect to its  participation  interest  as fully as if such Person were a
Lender  hereunder.  Each Lender hereby agrees that any set-off affected pursuant
to this  Section  11.2  shall  be  subject  to the  terms  of the  Intercreditor
Agreement.

         transfer any of its rights or obligations  hereunder  without the prior
         written  consent  of the  Administrative  Agent and each  Lender and no
         Lender  may  assign  or  otherwise   transfer  any  of  its  rights  or

         with the provisions of subsection  (b) of this Section,  (ii) by way of

         (and any other  attempted  assignment  or transfer by any party  hereto
         shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or
         implied,  shall be construed to confer upon any Person  (other than the
         parties  hereto,  their  respective  successors  and assigns  permitted
         hereby,  Participants  to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this
         Section and, to the extent expressly  contemplated  hereby, the Related

         reason of this Credit Agreement.

                  (b) Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign
         to one or more  Eligible  Assignees  all or a portion of its rights and
         obligations under this Credit Agreement  (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection
         (b),  participations  in L/C Obligations and in Swingline Loans) at the
         time owing to it); provided that

                           (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire
                  remaining amount of the assigning Lender's  Commitment and the
                  Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an  assignment
                  to a Lender or an  Affiliate  of a Lender or an Approved  Fund
                  with  respect  to  a  Lender,  the  aggregate  amount  of  the
                  Commitment  (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
                  thereunder)  or, if the Commitment is not then in effect,  the
                  principal  outstanding  balance of the Loans of the  assigning
                  Lender subject to each such  assignment,  determined as of the
                  date  the  Assignment  and  Assumption  with  respect  to such
                  assignment  is  delivered to the  Administrative  Agent or, if
                  "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as
                  of the Trade Date,  shall not be less than  $5,000,000  unless
                  each of the  Administrative  Agent and, so long as no Event of
                  Default has occurred and is continuing,  the Parent  otherwise
                  consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
                  delayed);

                           (ii)  each  partial  assignment  shall  be made as an
                  assignment  of a  proportionate  part  of  all  the  assigning
                  Lender's  rights and obligations  under this Credit  Agreement
                  with respect to the Loans or the Commitment  assigned,  except
                  that this  clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of
                  Swingline Loans;

                           (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved
                  by the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Issuing  Lender  and  the
                  Swingline  Lender  unless  the  Person  that  is the  proposed
                  assignee  is  itself a  Lender  (whether  or not the  proposed
                  assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and

                           (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
                  deliver  to  the   Administrative   Agent  an  Assignment  and

                                       83
<PAGE>

                  Assumption,  together with a processing and recordation fee of
                  $3,500,  and  the  Eligible  Assignee,  if it  shall  not be a
                  Lender,   shall  deliver  to  the   Administrative   Agent  an
                  Administrative Questionnaire.

         Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
         pursuant  to  subsection  (c) of  this  Section,  from  and  after  the
         effective  date  specified  in  each  Assignment  and  Assumption,  the
         Eligible Assignee  thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement
         and,  to the extent of the  interest  assigned by such  Assignment  and
         Assumption,  have the rights  and  obligations  of a Lender  under this
         Credit  Agreement,  and the assigning Lender  thereunder  shall, to the
         extent of the interest  assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,  be
         released from its obligations  under this Credit Agreement (and, in the
         case of an  Assignment  and  Assumption  covering all of the  assigning
         Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this  Credit  Agreement,  such
         Lender  shall  cease to be a party  hereto)  but shall  continue  to be
         entitled to the benefits of Sections  3.8,  3.12,  3.14,  and 11.6 with
         respect to facts and  circumstances  occurring  prior to the  effective
         date of such assignment.  Upon request,  each Borrower (at its expense)
         shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment
         or  transfer  by a Lender of rights or  obligations  under this  Credit
         Agreement  that does not comply with this  subsection  shall be treated
         for  purposes  of this Credit  Agreement  as a sale by such Lender of a
         participation  in  such  rights  and  obligations  in  accordance  with
         subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
         purpose  as  an  agent  of  the   Borrowers,   shall  maintain  at  the
         Administrative  Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
         delivered  to it and a register  for the  recordation  of the names and
         addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts
         of the Loans and L/C Obligations  owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
         terms  hereof  from time to time (the  "Register").  The entries in the
         Register shall be conclusive,  and the  Borrowers,  the  Administrative
         Agent and the Lenders  may treat each Person  whose name is recorded in
         the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
         purposes  of  this  Credit  Agreement,  notwithstanding  notice  to the
         contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Parent
         and the  Issuing  Lender at any  reasonable  time and from time to time
         upon reasonable prior notice.  In addition,  at any time that a request
         for a consent  for a  material  or  substantive  change  to the  Credit
         Documents is pending,  any Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders
         in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative
         Agent a copy of the Register.

                  (d)  Participations.  Any Lender may at any time,  without the
         consent  of, or notice to, any  Borrower or the  Administrative  Agent,
         sell  participations  to any Person  (other than a natural  person or a
         Borrower or any of such Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
         "Participant")  in all or a  portion  of such  Lender's  rights  and/or
         obligations under this Credit Agreement  (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations
         in L/C Obligations  and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that
         (i) such Lender's  obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain
         unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall  remain  solely  responsible  to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such  obligations and (iii)
         the Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent,  the Lenders and the Issuing
         Lender shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations  under this Credit
         Agreement.

         Any  agreement  or  instrument  pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
         participation  shall  provide  that such Lender  shall  retain the sole
         right to enforce this Credit  Agreement  and to approve any  amendment,
         modification  or  waiver of any  provision  of this  Credit  Agreement;
         provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender
         will  not,  without  the  consent  of  the  Participant,  agree  to any
         amendment,  waiver or other modification described in the first proviso
         to Section 11.7 that affects such  Participant.  Subject to  subsection

                                       84
<PAGE>

         (e) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be
         entitled to the benefits of Sections  3.8,  3.12,  and 3.14 to the same
         extent  as if it  were a  Lender  and  had  acquired  its  interest  by
         assignment  pursuant to subsection  (b) of this Section.  To the extent
         permitted  by law,  each  Participant  also  shall be  entitled  to the
         benefits  of  Section  11.2 as though it were a Lender,  provided  such
         Participant  agrees to be subject  to  Section  3.2 as though it were a
         Lender.

                  (e) Limitations upon Participant  Rights. A Participant  shall
         not be entitled to receive any  greater  payment  under  Section 3.8 or
         3.12 than the  applicable  Lender  would have been  entitled to receive
         with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,  unless the
         sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Parent's
         prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if
         it were a Lender  shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.13
         unless the  Borrower  is  notified  of the  participation  sold to such
         Participant  and  such  Participant  agrees,  for  the  benefit  of the
         Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.13(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (f)  Certain  Pledges.  Any Lender  may at any time  pledge or
         assign a security  interest in all or any  portion of its rights  under
         this  Credit  Agreement  (including  under its Note,  if any) to secure
         obligations  of such  Lender,  including  any pledge or  assignment  to
         secure  obligations  to a Federal  Reserve Bank;  provided that no such
         pledge  or  assignment  shall  release  such  Lender  from  any  of its
         obligations  hereunder or  substitute  any such pledgee or assignee for
         such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (g)   Electronic   Execution   of   Assignments.   The   words
         "execution,"  "signed,"  "signature,"  and words of like  import in any
         Assignment  and  Assumption  shall  be  deemed  to  include  electronic
         signatures or the keeping of records in electronic  form, each of which
         shall be of the same legal  effect,  validity  or  enforceability  as a
         manually executed  signature or the use of a paper-based  recordkeeping
         system,  as the case may be, to the extent and as  provided  for in any
         applicable law, including the Federal  Electronic  Signatures in Global
         and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and
         Records  Act,  or any other  similar  state laws  based on the  Uniform
         Electronic Transactions Act.

                  (h)  Resignation as Issuing  Lender or Swingline  Lender after
         Assignment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
         if at any time Bank of America  assigns all of its Commitment and Loans
         pursuant to  subsection  (b) above,  Bank of America  may,  (i) upon 30
         days'  notice to the Parent and the Lenders,  resign as Issuing  Lender
         and/or  (ii) upon 30 days'  notice to the Parent,  resign as  Swingline
         Lender.  In the  event of any such  resignation  as  Issuing  Lender or
         Swingline  Lender,  the Parent  shall be entitled to appoint from among
         the Lenders a successor  Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender  hereunder;
         provided,  however,  that no failure by the Parent to appoint  any such
         successor  shall affect the  resignation  of Bank of America as Issuing
         Lender or  Swingline  Lender,  as the case may be.  If Bank of  America
         resigns  as  Issuing  Lender,  it  shall  retain  all  the  rights  and
         obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters
         of Credit  outstanding as of the effective  date of its  resignation as
         Issuing Lender and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto  (including
         the right to require  the  Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk
         participations in Unreimbursed  Amounts pursuant to Section 2.2(c)). If
         Bank of America  resigns as Swingline  Lender,  it shall retain all the
         rights of the Swingline  Lender  provided for hereunder with respect to
         Swingline  Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of
         such  resignation,  including  the right to require the Lenders to make
         Base Rate Loans or fund risk  participations  in outstanding  Swingline
         Loans pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

         11.4     NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

         No failure by any  Lender,  the  Issuing  Lender or the  Administrative
Agent to  exercise,  and no delay by any such Person in  exercising,  any right,
remedy,  power or privilege  hereunder  shall operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor
shall any single or partial  exercise of any right,  remedy,  power or privilege
hereunder  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other  right,  remedy,  power or  privilege.  The rights,  remedies,  powers and
privileges  herein  provided  are  cumulative  and not  exclusive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.


         11.5     TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and
the Issuing Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below),  except that  Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates
and to  its  and  its  Affiliates'  respective  partners,  directors,  officers,
employees,  agents,  advisors and  representatives (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such  disclosure  is made will be informed  of the  confidential
nature  of  such   Information   and   instructed   to  keep  such   Information
confidential),   (b)  to  the  extent  requested  by  any  regulatory  authority
purporting  to  have  jurisdiction   over  it  (including  any   self-regulatory
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners),  (c) to
the extent  required by  applicable  laws or  regulations  or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies  hereunder  or under any other  Credit  Document or any
action or  proceeding  relating to this  Credit  Agreement  or any other  Credit
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section,
to (i) any  assignee of or  Participant  in, or any  prospective  assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations  under this Credit Agreement or
(ii) any actual or  prospective  counterparty  (or its  advisors) to any swap or
derivative transaction relating to the Borrowers and their obligations, (g) with
the  consent of the Parent or (h) to the extent  such  Information  (x)  becomes
publicly  available  other  than as a result of a breach of this  Section or (y)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender,
the Issuing Lender or any of their  respective  Affiliates on a  nonconfidential
basis from a source other than the Borrower.

For purposes of this Section,  "Information" means all information received from
the Borrowers or any  Subsidiary  relating to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or
any of their  respective  businesses,  other than any such  information  that is
available to the  Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or
any  Subsidiary,  provided  that, in the case of  information  received from the
Borrower or any Subsidiary  after the date hereof,  such  information is clearly
identified  at the time of  delivery  as  confidential.  Any Person  required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered  to have  complied  with its  obligation  to do so if such Person has
exercised  the same  degree  of care to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

         11.6     EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGES WAIVER.

                  (a)  Costs  and  Expenses.  The  Borrower  shall  pay  (i) all

         the  Collateral  Agent and their  Affiliates  (including the reasonable
         fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent
         and the Collateral  Agent),  in connection  with the syndication of the
         credit facilities  provided for herein,  the preparation,  negotiation,

         reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the Issuing  Lender in

         Collateral Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender (including the fees,
         charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative  Agent,
         any Lender or the Issuing  Lender),  in connection with the enforcement
         or  protection  of  its  rights  (A) in  connection  with  this  Credit
         Agreement  and the other Credit  Documents,  including its rights under
         this Section,  or (B) in  connection  with the Loans made or Letters of
         Credit  issued  hereunder,  including all such  out-of-pocket  expenses
         incurred during any workout,  restructuring  or negotiations in respect
         of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

                  (b)  Indemnification  by  the  Borrower.  The  Borrower  shall
         indemnify the  Administrative  Agent (and any sub-agent  thereof),  the

         Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
         "Indemnitee")  against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and
         all  losses,   claims,   damages,   liabilities  and  related  expenses
         (including the fees,  charges and  disbursements of any counsel for any
         Indemnitee),  incurred  by  any  Indemnitee  or  asserted  against  any
         Indemnitee  by any third  party or by a  Borrower  or any other  Credit
         Party  arising out of, in  connection  with,  or as a result of (i) the
         execution  or  delivery  of this  Credit  Agreement,  any other  Credit
         Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby,
         the performance by the parties hereto of their  respective  obligations
         hereunder  or  thereunder  or  the  consummation  of  the  transactions
         contemplated  hereby or  thereby,  (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or
         the  use or  proposed  use of the  proceeds  therefrom  (including  any
         refusal by the  Issuing  Lender to honor a demand for  payment  under a
         Letter of Credit if the  documents  presented in  connection  with such
         demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit),
         (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous  Materials
         on or from any  property  owned or operated by a Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries,  or any  Environmental  Liability related in any way to a
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,  or (iv) any actual or prospective
         claim,  litigation,  investigation or proceeding relating to any of the
         foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether
         brought by a third party or by the Borrowers or any other Credit Party,
         and  regardless of whether any  Indemnitee is a party  thereto,  in all
         cases, whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of
         the  comparative,  contributory  or sole  negligence of the Indemnitee;
         provided  that such  indemnity  shall  not,  as to any  Indemnitee,  be
         available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities
         or  related  expenses  (x)  are  determined  by a  court  of  competent
         jurisdiction by final and nonappealable  judgment to have resulted from
         the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of such  Indemnitee or (y)
         result  from a claim  brought by a Borrower or any other  Credit  Party
         against  an  Indemnitee  for  breach in bad faith of such  Indemnitee's
         obligations  hereunder  or under any  other  Credit  Document,  if such
         Borrower or such Credit  Party has  obtained a final and  nonappealable
         judgment  in its  favor  on such  claim  as  determined  by a court  of
         competent jurisdiction.

                  (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrowers
         for any  reason  fail to  indefeasibly  pay any amount  required  under
         subsection  (a)  or  (b)  of  this  Section  to be  paid  by it to  the
         Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof),  the Collateral Agent,
         the Issuing Lender or any Related Party of any of the  foregoing,  each
         Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such
         sub-agent),  the Issuing Lender or such Related Party,  as the case may

                                       87
<PAGE>

         be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that
         the applicable  unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
         such  unpaid  amount,   provided  that  the  unreimbursed   expense  or
         indemnified loss, claim,  damage,  liability or related expense, as the
         case may be, was  incurred  by or asserted  against the  Administrative
         Agent (or any such  sub-agent) or the Issuing Lender in its capacity as
         such, or against any Related  Party of any of the foregoing  acting for
         the  Administrative  Agent (or any such sub-agent) or Issuing Lender in
         connection  with such  capacity.  The  obligations of the Lenders under
         this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 3.2(d).

                  (d)  Waiver of  Consequential  Damages,  Etc.  To the  fullest
         extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers shall not assert, and
         hereby  waive,  any claim  against  any  Indemnitee,  on any  theory of
         liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
         opposed  to direct or actual  damages)  arising  out of, in  connection
         with,  or as a result  of,  this  Credit  Agreement,  any other  Credit
         Document  or any  agreement  or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  the
         transactions  contemplated  hereby  or  thereby,  any Loan or Letter of
         Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in
         subsection  (b) above shall be liable for any damages  arising from the
         use by unintended  recipients  of any  information  or other  materials
         distributed  by it  through  telecommunications,  electronic  or  other
         information   transmission  systems  in  connection  with  this  Credit
         Agreement   or  the  other  Credit   Documents   or  the   transactions
         contemplated hereby or thereby.

                  (e)  Payments.  All  amounts due under this  Section  shall be
         payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor.

                  (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
         resignation of the  Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent and the
         Issuing Lender,  the replacement of any Lender,  the termination of the
         Commitments  and the  repayment,  satisfaction  or discharge of all the
         other Credit Party Obligations.

         11.7     AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

         No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement or any
other Credit  Document,  and no consent to any  departure by any Borrower or any
other Credit Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the
Required  Lenders,  the Parent and the applicable  Credit Party, as the case may
be,  and  acknowledged  by the  Administrative  Agent,  and each such  waiver or
consent  shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the specific
purpose for which given;  provided,  however, that no such amendment,  waiver or
consent shall:

                  (a)  extend or  increase  the  Commitment  of any  Lender  (or
         reinstate any  Commitment  terminated  pursuant to Section 9.2) without
         the written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that
         a waiver of any condition  precedent set forth in Section 5.2 or of any
         Default or Event of Default or a mandatory  reduction in Commitments is
         not considered an extension or increase in Commitments of any Lender);

                  (b)  postpone  any date fixed by this Credit  Agreement or any
         other Credit Document for any payment of principal,  interest,  fees or
         other  amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them)  hereunder  or under
         any other Credit  Document  without the written  consent of each Lender
         directly affected thereby;

                  (c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
         herein on, any Revolving  Loan or L/C  Borrowing,  or any fees or other
         amounts payable  hereunder or under any other Credit  Document  without
         the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided,

                                       88
<PAGE>

         however,  that  only  the  consent  of the  Required  Lenders  shall be
         necessary  to amend the  definition  of "Default  Rate" or to waive any
         obligation of any Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate;

                  (d) change  Section  3.2 or Section 9.3 in a manner that would
         alter the pro rata sharing of payments or the order of  application  of
         payments  required  thereby  without the written consent of each Lender
         directly affected thereby;

                  (e)  change  any   provision  of  this  Section  11.7  or  the
         definition  of  "Required   Lenders"  or  any  other  provision  hereof
         specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive
         or otherwise modify any rights  hereunder or make any  determination or
         grant any consent  hereunder without the written consent of each Lender
         directly affected thereby;

                  (f) (i) release any Borrower or, except in  connection  with a
         merger or  consolidation  permitted  under Section 8.4 or a Disposition
         permitted  under  Section  8.5,  all  or   substantially   all  of  the
         Guarantors,  from its or their  obligations  under the Credit Documents
         without the written consent of each Lender directly  affected  thereby;
         or (ii) except in connection with a Disposition permitted under Section
         8.5,  release all or  substantially  all of the Collateral  without the
         written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

         and, provided further, that (i) no amendment,  waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the applicable Issuing Lender in addition to the
Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of such Issuing Lender under
this Credit Agreement or any Letter of Credit Application relating to any Letter
of Credit  issued or to be issued by it;  (ii) no  amendment,  waiver or consent
shall,  unless in writing and signed by the Administrative  Agent in addition to
the Lenders  required above,  affect the rights or duties of the  Administrative
Agent  under  this  Credit  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document;  (iii) no
amendment,  waiver  or  consent  shall,  unless  in  writing  and  signed by the
Collateral Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or
duties of the Collateral  Agent under this Credit  Agreement or any other Credit
Document;  and (iv) the Fee  Letter  may be  amended,  or rights  or  privileges
thereunder   waived,  in  a  writing  executed  only  by  the  parties  thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,  waiver or consent  hereunder,
except  that the  Commitment  of such  Lender may not be  increased  or extended
without the consent of such Lender.

Notwithstanding  the fact that the  consent of all the  Lenders is  required  in
certain circumstances as set forth above, (A) each Lender is entitled to vote as
such Lender sees fit on any  reorganization  plan that  affects the Loans or the
Letters of Credit,  and each Lender  acknowledges that the provisions of Section
1126(c) of the Bankruptcy  Code supersede the unanimous  consent  provisions set
forth herein and (B) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a Credit Party to
use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

         11.8     COUNTERPARTS/TELECOPY.

         This Credit  Agreement  may be executed in any number of  counterparts,
each of which where so executed and delivered  shall be an original,  but all of
which  shall  constitute  one and the  same  instrument.  Delivery  of  executed
counterparts  by  telecopy  shall  be as  effective  as an  original  and  shall
constitute a representation that an original will be delivered.

                                       89

         11.9     HEADINGS.

         The headings of the sections  and  subsections  hereof are provided for
convenience  only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of
any provision of this Credit Agreement.

         11.10    DEFAULTING LENDER.

         Each Lender  understands and agrees that if such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender  than  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section  11.7 it shall not be
entitled to vote on any matter  requiring the consent of the Required Lenders or
to object to any matter  requiring  the  consent of all the  Lenders;  provided,
however,  that all other  benefits and  obligations  under the Credit  Documents
shall apply to such Defaulting Lender.

         11.11   SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All  representations  and  warranties  made  hereunder and in any other
Credit  Document or other document  delivered  pursuant  hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof
and thereof.  Such  representations  and warranties  have been or will be relied
upon  by the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Collateral  Agent  and  each  Lender,
regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent  or  any  Lender  or  on  their  behalf  and   notwithstanding   that  the
Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge  of any Default at the time of any  issuance of Loans or  extension of
any Letter of Credit, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any
Loan or any other  Credit Party  Obligation  hereunder  shall  remain  unpaid or
unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

         11.12    GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.

                  (a) THIS CREDIT  AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT  DOCUMENTS AND
         THE RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS  OF THE PARTIES  HEREUNDER  AND  THEREUNDER
         SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND  INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH
         THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. Any legal action or proceeding
         with respect to this Credit  Agreement or any other Credit Document may
         be  brought  in the  courts  of the State of South  Carolina  or of the
         United States for the District of South Carolina, and, by execution and
         delivery of this Credit Agreement, each Credit Party hereby irrevocably
         accepts  for  itself  and in respect  of its  property,  generally  and
         unconditionally,  the  jurisdiction  of such courts.  Each Credit Party
         further  irrevocably  consents  to the service of process out of any of
         the  aforementioned  courts  in any such  action or  proceeding  by the
         mailing of copies  thereof by  registered  or certified  mail,  postage
         prepaid,  to it at the address for  notices  pursuant to Section  11.1,
         such service to become  effective 10 days after such  mailing.  Nothing
         herein shall affect the right of a Lender to serve process in any other
         manner  permitted  by  law  or  to  commence  legal  proceedings  or to
         otherwise  proceed  against a Credit  Party in any other  jurisdiction.
         Each  Credit  Party  agrees  that a final  judgment  in any  action  or
         proceeding   shall  be   conclusive   and  may  be  enforced  in  other
         jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other manner  provided
         by law;  provided that nothing in this Section  11.12(a) is intended to
         impair a Credit Party's right under  applicable law to appeal or seek a
         stay of any judgment.

                  (b) Each Credit Party hereby  irrevocably waives any objection
         which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
         aforesaid  actions or proceedings  arising out of or in connection with
         this  Credit  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document  brought in the
         courts  referred  to  in  subsection  (a)  hereof  and  hereby  further

                                       90
<PAGE>

         irrevocably  waives  and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
         that any such action or  proceeding  brought in any such court has been
         brought in an inconvenient forum.

         11.13    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

         EACH PARTY HERETO  HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES,  TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT
PERMITTED  BY  APPLICABLE  LAW,  ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL  PROCEEDING  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  ARISING  OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT OR THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY  (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,  TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH
PARTY  HERETO (A)  CERTIFIES  THAT NO  REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PERSON HAS  REPRESENTED,  EXPRESSLY OR  OTHERWISE,  THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,  SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS  CREDIT  AGREEMENT  AND THE OTHER  CREDIT  DOCUMENTS  BY,  AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         11.14    PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.

         To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrowers is made
to  the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Issuing  Lender  or  any  Lender,  or  the
Administrative  Agent,  the Issuing Lender or any Lender  exercises its right of
setoff,  and such  payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is
subsequently invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or preferential,  set aside
or  required   (including  pursuant  to  any  settlement  entered  into  by  the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender in its discretion) to be
repaid  to a  trustee,  receiver  or any other  party,  in  connection  with any
proceeding  under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise,  then (a) to the extent of
such  recovery,  the  obligation  or  part  thereof  originally  intended  to be
satisfied  shall be revived  and  continued  in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such setoff had not  occurred,  and (b) each Lender
and the Issuing Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent upon
demand its  applicable  share (without  duplication)  of any amount so recovered
from or repaid by the Administrative  Agent, plus interest thereon from the date
of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  The  obligations of the Lenders
and the Issuing Lender under clause (b) of the preceding  sentence shall survive
the payment in full of the Credit Party  Obligations and the termination of this
Credit Agreement.

         11.15    SEVERABILITY.

         If any  provision of any of the Credit  Documents is  determined  to be
illegal,  invalid or unenforceable,  such provision shall be fully severable and
the  remaining  provisions  shall  remain in full  force and effect and shall be
construed  without  giving  effect  to the  illegal,  invalid  or  unenforceable
provisions.

         11.16    FURTHER ASSURANCES.

         The Credit  Parties  agree,  upon the request of an Agent,  to promptly
take such  actions,  as reasonably  requested,  as is necessary to carry out the
intent of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents,  including,  but
not limited  to, such  actions as are  necessary  to ensure that the  Collateral

                                       91
<PAGE>

Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, has a perfected security interest
in the Collateral subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens.

         11.17    ENTIRETY.

         This Credit Agreement  together with the other Credit Documents and the
Fee Letter represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and
supersede all prior  agreements  and  understandings,  oral or written,  if any,
including  any  commitment  letters  or  correspondence  relating  to the Credit
Documents or the transactions contemplated herein and therein.

         11.18    BINDING EFFECT; CONTINUING AGREEMENT.

                  (a) This Credit  Agreement shall become effective at such time
         when all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have been satisfied
         or waived by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Required
         Lenders) and the Administrative Agent shall have received copies hereof
         (telefaxed  or  otherwise)  which,   when  taken  together,   bear  the
         signatures  of the  Borrowers,  the  Guarantors  and the  Lenders,  and
         thereafter this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
         benefit of the Borrowers,  the  Guarantors,  the Agents and each Lender
         and their respective successors and assigns.

                  (b) This Credit Agreement shall be a continuing  agreement and
         shall remain in full force and effect until all Loans, L/C Obligations,
         interest,  fees and other  Credit  Party  Obligations  (other  than any
         obligations  which by the  terms  thereof  are  stated to  survive  the
         termination  of the  Credit  Documents)  have been paid in full and all
         Commitments   and  Letters  of  Credit  have  been   terminated.   Upon
         termination,  the Credit  Parties  shall  have no  further  obligations
         (other than the  indemnification  provisions  that  survive)  under the
         Credit  Documents and the  Collateral  Agent shall,  at the request and
         expense of the Parent,  deliver all Collateral in its possession to the
         Parent and release all Liens on  Collateral;  provided  that should any
         payment,  in whole or in  part,  of the  Credit  Party  Obligations  be
         rescinded or otherwise  required to be restored or returned by an Agent
         or any Lender,  whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
         reorganization   or  otherwise,   then  the  Credit   Documents   shall
         automatically be reinstated and all Liens of the Lenders shall reattach
         to the Collateral  and all amounts  required to be restored or returned
         and all costs and expenses incurred by an Agent or Lender in connection
         therewith  shall  be  deemed  included  as  part  of the  Credit  Party
         Obligations.

         11.19    USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE.

         Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the
Administrative  Agent  (for  itself  and not on  behalf  of any  Lender)  hereby
notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the  requirements of the USA Patriot Act
(Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it
is  required  to obtain,  verify and record  information  that  identifies  each
Borrower,  which information  includes the name and address of the Borrowers and
other  information that will allow such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent, as
applicable, to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Act.
