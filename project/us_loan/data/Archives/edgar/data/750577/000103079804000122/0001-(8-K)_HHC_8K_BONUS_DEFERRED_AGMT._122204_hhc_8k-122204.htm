                                              <B>HANCOCK HOLDING COMPANY
                                     BONUS AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT
                                                George A. Schloegel</B>


         <B>This Bonus and Deferred Compensation  Agreement</B> (the "Agreement"),  is made and entered into this 22nd day
of December,  2004, by and between Hancock Holding Company, a corporation  organized and existing under the laws of
the State of Mississippi (the  "Company"),  and George A. Schloegel  ("Schloegel"),  to be effective as of the date
hereof (the "Effective Date").

<B>1.       Purpose and Intent:</B>

         It is the intent of the parties that this  Agreement  shall be  considered  an  arrangement  maintained to
provide supplemental  compensation and retirement income for the benefit of Schloegel,  who is a member of a select
group of key management  employees of the Company  within the meaning of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security
Act of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA").  As such,  this  Agreement is not intended to  constitute  an employee  benefit
plan that is subject to the  provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA.  In  accordance  with such intent,
any  obligation  of the Company  hereunder  shall be deemed an  unsecured  promise,  and any right of  Schloegel to
enforce  such  obligation  shall be  solely  as a  general  creditor  of the  Company.  This  Plan is  intended  to
constitute a payroll practice during the term of Schloegel's  employment and a nonqualified  deferred  compensation
plan thereafter.

<B>2.       Payments:</B>

         <B>2.1      Continuing  Payments.</B>  Subject  to the  satisfaction  of the  payment  contingency  set  forth in
                  Section 4  hereof,  the  Company  shall  provide  to  Schloegel  the sum  equal to  $63,500  (the
                  "Continuing  Payment"),  which amount shall be paid annually in the form of a single-sum  payment
                  not later than the first  business day of the second  calendar  quarter  during the Payment Term.
                  For purposes of this Section 2, the "Payment  Term" shall  commence as of the Effective  Date and
                  shall end as of the earlier of (a) 10 years  after the  Effective  Date,  or (b) the later of the
                  date on which Schloegel or his spouse shall die.

         <B>2.2      Continuing  Tax  Payments.</B>  The Company  shall pay to Schloegel an  additional  amount such that,
                  after the  payment  by  Schloegel  of all  income and  employment  taxes due with  respect to the
                  Continuing  Payment,  there  remains  a  balance  equal  to the  amount  of  such  payment  (such
                  additional  amount referred to herein as the  "Continuing  Tax Payment").  Schloegel shall submit
                  annually to the Company a request for the amount of the  Continuing  Tax Payment,  together  with
                  supporting  documentation.  If Schloegel  and the Company agree as to the amount of such payment,
                  the  Company  shall  make  payment  not later  than 30 days after  receipt  of the  request  from
                  Schloegel.  If the Company and  Schloegel  disagree as to the  determination  of such amount,  an
                  independent  public  accounting  firm agreed upon by  Schloegel  and the Company  shall make such
                  determination.

<PRE>
         <B>2.3      Initial Tax Payment.</B>  The Company  shall pay to Schloegel an amount such that,  after the payment
                  by Schloegel of all income and  employment  taxes with  respect to such amount,  there  remains a
                  balance equal to any income and  employment  taxes due by Schloegel on account of the release and
                  cancellation  by  the  Company  of  those  certain  collateral  assignments,  all as  more  fully
                  described  in Section 2 of that  certain  Cancellation  Agreement  by and  between  the  Company,
                  Schloegel and Hancock Bank,  in its capacity as the trustee of that certain  George A.  Schloegel
                  Life Insurance  Trust U/A dated February 13, 1991 (the "Trust") (the  "Cancellation  Agreement"),
                  which  agreement  is  attached  hereto as Exhibit A.  Schloegel  shall  submit to the Company his
                  determination  of the amount to be paid  hereunder,  together with supporting  documentation.  If
                  Schloegel  and the Company  agree as to such amount,  the Company shall make payment to Schloegel
                  not later than 60 days after receipt of Schloegel's  determination.  If Schloegel and the Company
                  disagree as to the  determination of such amount,  an independent  public  accounting firm agreed
                  upon by Schloegel and the Company shall make such determination.

         <B>2.4      Payments to  Beneficiaries.</B>  If  Schloegel  shall die during the  Payment  Term,  any  Continuing
                  Payments  remaining to be paid  hereunder  shall be made to his spouse,  at such time and in such
                  amount  and  manner  as set forth  above.  If and to the  extent  any such  payment  is deemed to
                  constitute  income in respect of a decedent  within the  meaning of Section  691 of the  Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  the Company shall make an additional  Continuing  Tax Payment,
                  calculated in the manner described in Section 2.2 hereof.

<B>3.       General Provisions:</B>

         <B>3.1      Protection  Against  Assignment.</B>  Neither  Schloegel  nor his spouse  shall  possess any power or
                  right to  transfer,  assign,  anticipate,  hypothecate,  mortgage,  commute,  modify or otherwise
                  encumber the right to receive the amounts  provided for in this Agreement,  nor shall any portion
                  of the amounts payable  hereunder be subject to seizure for the payment of any debts,  judgments,
                  alimony  or  separate  maintenance  owed by  Schloegel  or his  spouse.  Any  attempt  to assign,
                  commute,  hypothecate,  transfer or dispose of all or any portion of the amounts  provided for in
                  this Agreement shall be void.

         <B>3.2      Successors.</B>  This  Agreement  shall be  binding  upon the  parties  hereto,  including  their  successors,
                  beneficiary(ies), heirs and personal representatives.

         <B>3.3      Effect on Other  Compensation  and Benefits.</B>  Nothing  contained in this Agreement  shall affect the right
                  of  Schloegel  to  participate  in or be  covered  by  any  qualified  or  nonqualified  pension,
                  profit-sharing,  bonus or other compensation  plan, policy or arrangement  offered by the Company
                  for the benefit of its employees or its similarly situated executives and/or officers.

                  any other rate of compensation.
