              NEWLY-FORMED NEOMEDIA TELECOM SERVICES BUSINESS UNIT
            GROWS WITH ACQUISITION OF TRITON GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES

                                       --

                  NEOMEDIA, TRITON AND ITS BSD SOFTWARE PARENT
         PROVIDE SERVICES TO TELECOM, INTERNET AND E-BUSINESS COMPANIES

      FT. MYERS, Fla., Dec. 21, 2004 - NeoMedia Technologies, Inc. (OTC BB:
NEOM), today moved to add industry specific experience and expertise to its
newly-formed NeoMedia Telecom Services business unit by signing a definitive
merger agreement to acquire BSD Software Inc. (OTC BB: BSDS) and its operating
entity, Triton Global Business Services.

      Via the Internet, Triton provides live and automated operator calling
services and e-business support, including billing, clearinghouse and
information management services, to companies in the telecommunications
industry, helping clients improve services and profitability by enabling them to
streamline operations and make quicker, more informed business decisions.

      Triton is 90% owned by BSD, which acquired it in 2002. For its fiscal year
ending July 31, 2004, BSD reported revenue of $6.1 million.

      Charles T. Jensen, NeoMedia's president, CEO and COO, said that BSD
shareholders will receive, for each share of BSD stock owned, NeoMedia stock
equivalent to .07 divided by the volume weighted average price of NeoMedia stock
for the five days prior to closing of the merger.

      Mr. Jensen also said that NeoMedia and BSD/Triton will file a joint
registration/information statement with the SEC for review. Closing of the
acquisition and merger will occur when the review is complete and the
registration is approved, he said.

STRONG SYNERGIES, STRONG RELATIONSHIPS

      Mr. Jensen reemphasized that the keys to the transaction were the strong
synergies between NeoMedia and BSD/Triton.

      "BSD and its Triton operating entity do business and have relationships
with companies and in market sectors where NeoMedia has, or seeks to build,
business and alliances," he said. "Those in-roads were integral to initiating
and completing this agreement, particularly in the telecom industry, where
NeoMedia intends to move forward quickly to build on those relationships, in
Canada, in the U.S., and overseas."

      Guy Fietz, CEO of BSD Software and president of Triton, said he was
"excited about adding value to an innovative, public company with a portfolio of
patented technology in emerging markets. BSD/Triton's proven sales and marketing
approaches will compliment NeoMedia's group of companies and products,
leveraging strengths from both sides to penetrate new and existing multinational
opportunities," he said.
