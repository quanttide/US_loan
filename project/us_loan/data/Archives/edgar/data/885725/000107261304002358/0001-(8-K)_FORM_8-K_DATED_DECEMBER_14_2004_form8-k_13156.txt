ITEM 5.02.  DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS;
            APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.

            On December 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific
Corporation (the "Company") appointed Paul A. LaViolette to the position of
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Prior to this appointment, Mr.
LaViolette, 47, served as Senior Vice President and Group President for the
Company's Cardiovascular businesses.   Mr. LaViolette joined the Company in
January 1994 as President of Boston Scientific International. In February 1995,
he became Group President for the Company's Endoscopy and Urology businesses. In
1998, he again joined Boston Scientific International as its President to help
strengthen and stabilize the organization. In 2000, Mr. LaViolette added Group
President responsibilities for the Scimed, EP Technologies and Target divisions,
and in 2001 also took on the role of President of Scimed.

            During 2000, the Company provided a home improvement loan in the
amount of $400,000 to Mr. LaViolette. The principal balance on the loan bears
interest at the then-current applicable federal rate for medium term notes
(approximately 6%) until the principal balance is paid in full. Principal,
together with interest compounded quarterly, is due and payable in October 2005.

            The Company announced additional management promotions. A copy of
the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The Company also provides
retention and indemnification agreements to its executive officers. Forms of
these agreements have been previously filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
