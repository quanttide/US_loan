ITEM 1.01   ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

            On December 15, 2004, Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. ("Lone
Star" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the stockholders
of the Company approved the 2004 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), which was
submitted to the stockholders for approval at a Special Meeting of Stockholders.

            Key features of the Plan include the following:

            o    The Plan replaces the Company's 1992 Incentive and Nonqualified
                 Stock Option Plan, which terminated in 2002.

            o    All directors, employees, consultants, advisors of Lone Star
                 and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Plan.
                 It is a ten-year plan with a 3 million share authorization of
                 which options to purchase 500,000 shares are available for
                 grants to Non-Employee Directors.

            o    Upon the effectiveness of the Plan, all Non-Employee Directors
                 will be granted options to purchase 15,000 shares and yearly
                 grants of options to purchase 7,500 shares. New Non-Employee
                 Directors upon their appointment to the Board of Directors will
                 receive options to purchase 40,000 shares. In addition, the
                 Chairman of the Audit Committee will receive an initial and
                 annual grants of options to purchase 2,500 shares.

            o    The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be
                 subject to options granted under the Plan to any individual
                 shall not exceed 600,000.

            o    Only stock options and dividend equivalents rights (which may
                 be granted simultaneously with the granting of the stock
                 options) may be offered under the Plan. Restricted stock is not
                 authorized to be issued under the Plan.

            o    Options may be issued as incentive stock options under Section
                 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or as
                 non-qualified stock options.

            o    The Plan requires stockholder approval in order to: reduce the
                 exercise price of outstanding options or effect repricing
                 through cancellation and re-grants of new options, increase the
                 number of shares issued under the Plan, materially increase the
                 benefits accruing under the plan, materially modify the
                 requirements as to eligibility for participation, decrease the
                 exercise price of an option to less than 100% of fair market
                 value on the grant date and extend the term of the option.

            o    The Plan is administered by the Compensation/Stock Option
                 Committee, which is comprised solely of at least three
                 independent, non-employee directors.

            o    Options granted under the Plan will have a maximum term of ten
                 years and unless otherwise determined by the Compensation/Stock
                 Option Committee at the time of grant will be subject to a
                 vesting period of four years.
