alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of PharmaBio to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the
Financing Agreement, the Security Agreement, or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or
omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the

of the liability of the Debtor, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. PharmaBio may, at its election, foreclose on any security by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any
such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Debtor or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against the Debtor, without affecting or impairing in any way
the liability of the Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, the Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such
election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantor against the Debtor or any security. </FONT></P> <P
