TO THE NORTH AMERICAN COAL CORPORATION<BR>
SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN<BR>
(As Amended and Restated effective September&nbsp;1, 1994)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, The North American Coal Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) amended and
restated The North American Coal Corporation Supplemental Retirement Benefit
Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) effective September&nbsp;1, 1994 and has since amended the Plan;
and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and
the AJCA Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of
the Supplemental Retirement Benefits that are accrued prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005;
and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, due to the uncertainty regarding the affect of the AJCA on
Supplemental Retirement Benefits under the Plan, the Company has decided to
temporarily freeze all Supplemental Retirement Benefits as of December&nbsp;31,
2004;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;5 to the
Plan, which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2005 to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and continue to be
governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to
the addition of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code (as specified in the Plan as in effect
prior January&nbsp;1, 2005); and (2)&nbsp;temporarily freeze the accrual of Supplemental
Retirement Benefits hereunder as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Words and phrases used herein with initial capital letters that are defined in
the Plan are used herein as so defined and the provisions hereof shall be
effective as of the close of business on December&nbsp;31, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;I of the Plan is hereby amended by the addition of the following
new Section&nbsp;1.6 at the end thereof to read as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Section&nbsp;1.6 American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan (including all
Amendments thereto) comply with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as
enacted by the AJCA, so as to prevent the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">inclusion in gross income of any
amount of Supplemental Retirement Benefit accrued hereunder in a taxable year
that is prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would
otherwise be actually distributed or made available to the Participants. The
Plan shall be administered in a manner that will comply with Section&nbsp;409A of
the Code, including proposed, temporary or final regulations or any other
guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue
Service with respect thereto (collectively with the AJCA, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;).
Any Plan provisions (including, without limitation, those added or amended by
Amendment No.&nbsp;5) that would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy Section&nbsp;409A of
the Code shall have no force and effect until amended to comply with Code
Section&nbsp;409A (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by the
AJCA Guidance).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Plan Administrator shall not take any action that would violate
any provision of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. The Plan Administrator is
authorized to adopt rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in
connection with the AJCA Guidance to anticipate and/or comply with the
requirements thereof (including any transition or grandfather rules
thereunder).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The effective date of Amendment No.&nbsp;5 to the Plan is December&nbsp;31,
2004. This Amendment temporarily freezes the Supplemental Retirement Benefits
under the Plan effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, with the intent being that
the Company will rescind the freeze upon issuance of the AJCA Guidance. In
furtherance of, but without limiting the foregoing, any Supplemental Retirement
Benefit that is deemed to have been deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 and that
qualifies for &#147;grandfathered status&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall
continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation prior to the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and shall be
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Plan as in effect prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2005.&#148;


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;2</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth sentence of Section&nbsp;2.1(2)(B) of the Plan is hereby amended to
read as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;The change of a Beneficiary under the Plan may be made, and may be
revoked, only by an instrument (in a form acceptable to the Company)
signed by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator prior to
the Participant&#146;s death.&#148;


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;3</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.1(10) of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety to read as

Plan for Salaried Employees (terminated November&nbsp;30, 1986), or Part&nbsp;I of
the Combined Defined Benefit Plan for NACCO Industries, Inc. and Its
Subsidiaries, which includes The NACCO Industries, Inc. Pension Plan for
Salaried Employees which was merged into such plan on December&nbsp;31, 1993)
(&#147;Plan 005&#148;). Pension accruals under Plan 005 for employees of NACCO
Industries, Inc. were generally frozen as of December&nbsp;31, 1993 and
pension accruals under Plan 005 for employees of all other Employers were
generally frozen as of December&nbsp;31, 2004; provided that such frozen
benefits are increased by a specified percentage for each year (in

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;III of the Plan is hereby amended by the addition of the following
new Section&nbsp;3.2C thereto, immediately following Section&nbsp;3.2B, to read as
follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Section&nbsp;3.2C Benefit Freeze. Notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan to the contrary, all Supplemental Retirement Benefits under the Plan
shall be frozen as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. In furtherance thereof, but
without limiting the foregoing, a Participant shall not receive credit
under this Plan for any service or compensation that is earned after
December&nbsp;31, 2004 (even if such service and compensation is taken into
account for purposes of calculating the Actual Pension Plan Benefit).
The Company intends that Supplemental Retirement Benefits that are
accrued (and, only if required under the AJCA Guidance, vested) on or
before December&nbsp;31, 2004 will qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status under
the AJCA and will continue to be governed by the law applicable to

of the Code.&#148;

Amendment No.&nbsp;7 to Plan 005 (i.e., the provision that fully vests all
Participants in their Pension Plan benefits as of December&nbsp;31, 2004)
would otherwise be deemed a &#147;material amendment&#148; under the AJCA Guidance
and cause Section&nbsp;409A of the Code to apply to &#147;grandfathered&#148; benefits
hereunder, such provisions of Amendment No.&nbsp;7 to Plan 005 shall not be

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Any Participant or Beneficiary who believes that he is entitled
to receive a benefit under the Plan which he has not received may file
with the Compensation Committee a written claim specifying the basis for
his claim and the facts upon which he relies in making such a claim.
Such a claim must be signed by the claimant or his duly authorized
representative (the &#147;Claimant&#148;).

Committee shall transmit a written notice of such decision to the
Claimant, within 90&nbsp;days after such claim was filed (plus an additional
period of 90&nbsp;days if required for processing, provided that notice of the

period). Such notice shall be written in a manner calculated to be
understood by the Claimant and shall state (a)&nbsp;the specific reason(s) for
the denial of the claim, (b)&nbsp;specific reference(s) to pertinent
provisions of the Plan on which the denial of the claim was based, (c)&nbsp;a
description of any additional material or information necessary for the

procedures under Subsection (3)&nbsp;below and the time limits applicable to
such procedures, including a statement of the Claimant&#146;s right to bring a

request that the claim denial be reviewed by filing with the Compensation
Committee a written request therefor. If such an appeal is not filed
within this 60-day limit, the Claimant shall be deemed to have agreed
with the Compensation Committee&#146;s denial of the claim. If such an appeal
is so filed within such 60 days, a named fiduciary designated by the
Compensation Committee shall (a)&nbsp;conduct a full and fair review of such
claim and (b)&nbsp;mail or deliver to the Claimant a written decision on the
matter based on the facts and pertinent provisions of the Plan within a
period of 60&nbsp;days after the receipt of the request for review unless
special circumstances require an extension of time, in which case such
decision shall be rendered not later than 120&nbsp;days after receipt of such
request. If an extension of time for review is required, written notice
of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the
commencement of the extension. Such decision (a)&nbsp;shall be written in a
