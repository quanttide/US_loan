<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, NACCO Industries, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted the Unfunded
Benefit Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) effective as of September&nbsp;1, 2000 and has since
amended the Plan; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;6.1 of the Plan, all amounts credited to a
Participant&#146;s Account under the Plan are 100% vested; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A and the AJCA
Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of the Excess
Retirement Benefits that were deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;6 to the Plan,
which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 (including any earnings thereon) to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and
continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation, and the terms of the Plan as in effect, prior to the addition of
Code Section&nbsp;409A and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 to be
deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

prevent the inclusion in gross income of any Excess Retirement Benefit
hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which
such amounts would otherwise actually be distributed or made available to the
