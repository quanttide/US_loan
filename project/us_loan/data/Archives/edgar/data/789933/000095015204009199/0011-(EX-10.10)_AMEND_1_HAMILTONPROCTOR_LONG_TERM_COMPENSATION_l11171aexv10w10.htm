WITH RESPECT TO<BR>
THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted the
Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the
&#147;Plan&#148;) effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2003; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Plan, all Awards under the Plan
are 100% vested as of the Grant Date (meaning that Awards with Grant Dates of
January&nbsp;1, 2004 are 100% vested as of December&nbsp;31, 2004); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A and the AJCA
Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of the Awards
that are deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to the Plan,
which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and to continue to be governed by
the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to the addition
of Code Section&nbsp;409A (as specified in the Plan as in effect before the adoption
of this Amendment No.&nbsp;4) and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004
to be deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

Section&nbsp;1A to the end thereof, to read as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;1A. American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;It is intended that the Plan (including any Amendments thereto) comply
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;),
as enacted by the AJCA, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any
Awards hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">in which such Awards would otherwise be actually paid or made available to the
Participant. The Plan shall be administered in a manner that will comply with
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, including proposed, temporary or final regulations or
any other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal
Revenue Service with respect thereto (collectively with the AJCA, the &#147;AJCA
Guidance&#148;). Any Plan provision that would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code (including any provision added by this Amendment)
shall have no force and effect until amended to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A
(which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by the AJCA
Guidance).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Committee shall not take any action hereunder that would violate
any provision of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. It is intended that all

AJCA Guidance. The Committee is authorized to adopt rules or regulations
deemed necessary or appropriate in connection therewith to anticipate and/or
comply with the requirements thereof (including any transition or grandfather
rules thereunder). In this regard, the Committee is authorized to permit
Participant elections with respect to amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004

such elections in accordance with the AJCA Guidance.

Guidance) as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and (b)&nbsp;the &#147;Post-2004 Awards&#148; for amounts
that are deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004. Amendment No.&nbsp;1 also modifies the
distribution elections and provisions for the Post-2004 Awards to comply with
the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

are deemed to have been deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 and that qualify for
&#147;grandfathered status&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall continue to be
governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to
the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and shall be subject to the terms and
conditions specified in the Plan as in effect prior to the effective date of
Amendment No.&nbsp;1 thereto. In particular (a)&nbsp;the Awards with Grant Dates of

Termination of Employment caused by death, Disability or Retirement, the
Maturity Date of all of the Participant&#146;s outstanding Post-2004 Awards shall be
the date of such Participant&#146;s Termination of Employment; provided, however,
that if the Participant is a Key Employee, the Participant&#146;s Maturity Date

the Book Value Units granted pursuant to each Award as soon as practicable
following the Maturity Date of such Award.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Value. For Participants who are employed on the Maturity Date, the
value of the Book Value Units shall be based on the Book Value as of the
Quarter Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. For Participants who
incur a Termination of Employment for reasons other than death, Disability or
Retirement, the value of the Book Value Units shall be based on the Book Value
as of the Quarter Date coincident with or immediately preceding the date of
termination (despite the fact that such amounts are not paid until the Maturity
Date). For Participants who terminate employment due to death, Disability or
Retirement, the value of such Book Value Units shall be based on the Book Value
as of the Quarter Date coincident with or immediately preceding the Maturity
Date; provided, however, that if a Participant is a Key Employee whose payment
is delayed for 6&nbsp;months, the value of the Book Value Units shall be based on
the Book Value as of the Quarter Date coincident with or immediately preceding

in its sole and absolute discretion shall have the right to determine what
deferral options will be available and shall amend the Plan to reflect those
options, subject to the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.&#148;

Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may at
any time, upon written request of the Participant, cause to be paid to such
Participant an amount equal to all or any part of the Participant&#146;s vested
Post-2004 Awards, if the Committee determines, based on such reasonable
evidence that it shall require, that such a payment or payments is necessary
for the purpose of alleviating the consequences of an Unforeseeable Emergency
occurring with respect to the Participant. Payments made on account of an
Unforeseeable Emergency shall be permitted only to the extent the amount does
not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (plus
an amount necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the
distribution) and may not be made to the extent such Unforeseeable Emergency is
or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant&#146;s assets (to the extent such
liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship).&#148;
