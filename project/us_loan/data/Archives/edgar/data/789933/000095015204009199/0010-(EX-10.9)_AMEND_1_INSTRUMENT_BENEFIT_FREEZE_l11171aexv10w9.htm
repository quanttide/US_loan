<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AMENDMENT NO. 1 AND INSTRUMENT OF BENEFIT FREEZE<BR>
TO THE<BR>
NACCO MATERIALS HANDLING GROUP, INC.<BR>
EXCESS PENSION PLAN FOR UK TRANSFEREES<BR>
Effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2002</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2002, NACCO Materials Handling Group,
Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted the NACCO Materials Handling Group, Inc. Excess
Pension Plan for UK Transferees (the &#147;Plan&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Article&nbsp;IV of the Plan, all Excess Pension Benefits
under the Plan are 100% vested; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and
the AJCA Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of
the Excess Pension Benefits that are accrued prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, due to the uncertainty regarding the affect of the AJCA on Excess
Pension Benefits under the Plan, the Company has decided to temporarily freeze
all Excess Pension Benefits as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to the
Plan, which amendment is intended to allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and continue to be governed by the
law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to the addition of
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code (as specified in the Plan as in effect prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2005).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Words and phrases used herein with initial capital letters that are defined in
the Plan are used herein as so defined and the provisions hereof shall be
effective as of the close of business on December&nbsp;31, 2004.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;I of the Plan is hereby amended by the addition of the following
new Section&nbsp;1.5 at the end thereof to read as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Section&nbsp;1.5 American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan (including all
Amendments thereto) comply with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as
enacted by the AJCA, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any
amount Excess Pension Benefit accrued hereunder in a taxable year that is prior
to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise be actually
distributed or made available to the Participants. The Plan shall be
administered in a manner that will comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code,
including proposed, temporary or final regulations or any other guidance issued
by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect
thereto (collectively with the AJCA, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;). Any Plan provisions
(including, without limitation, those added or amended by Amendment No.&nbsp;1) that
would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall have no
force and effect until amended to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A (which
amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by the AJCA Guidance).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Plan Administrator shall not take any action that would violate
any provision of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. The Plan Administrator is
authorized to adopt rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in
connection with the AJCA Guidance to anticipate and/or comply with the
requirements thereof (including any transition or grandfather rules
thereunder).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The effective date of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to this Plan is December&nbsp;31,
2004. This Amendment temporarily freezes the Excess Pension Benefits effective
as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, with the intent being that the Company will rescind
the freeze upon issuance of the AJCA Guidance. In furtherance of, but without
limiting the foregoing, any Excess Pension Benefit that is deemed to have been
deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 and that qualifies for &#147;grandfathered status&#148;
under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall continue to be governed by the law
applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to the addition of
Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and shall be subject to the terms and conditions
specified in the Plan as in effect prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005.&#148;

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Benefit Freeze. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the

of December&nbsp;31, 2004. In furtherance thereof, but without limiting the
foregoing, a Participant shall not receive
