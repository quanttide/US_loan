THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, The North American Coal Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted an
amended and restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Management Employees (the
&#147;Plan&#148;) effective as of November&nbsp;1, 2000 and has since amended the Plan; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Article&nbsp;V of the Plan, all amounts credited to a
Participant&#146;s Account under the Plan are 100% vested; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A and the AJCA
Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of the Excess
Retirement Benefits that were deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to the Plan,
which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 (including any earnings thereon) to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and
continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation, and the terms of the Plan as in effect, prior to the addition of
Code Section&nbsp;409A and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 to be
deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;I of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new Section&nbsp;1.6 to the
end thereof, to read as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;It is intended that the Plan (including all Amendments thereto) comply
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as enacted by AJCA, so as to
prevent the inclusion in gross income of any Excess Retirement Benefit
hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which
such amounts would otherwise actually be distributed or made available to the
Participants. The Plan shall be administered in

the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto

(including, without limitation, those added or amended by Amendment No.&nbsp;4) that
would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall have no

amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by the AJCA Guidance).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Plan Administrator shall not take any action that would violate
any provision of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. It is intended that, to the extent

409A and the AJCA Guidance. The Plan Administrator is authorized to adopt
rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in connection therewith to
anticipate and/or comply with the requirements thereof (including any

Administrator is authorized to permit Participant elections with respect to
amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 and is also permitted to allow the
Participants the right to amend or revoke such elections in accordance with the
AJCA Guidance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The effective date of Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to this Plan is January&nbsp;1, 2005.
This Amendment creates additional Sub-Accounts (where necessary) (i)&nbsp;to

after December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and earnings thereon) (the &#147;Post-2004 Sub-Accounts&#148;).
Amendment No.&nbsp;4 also modifies the distribution elections and provisions for the
Post-2004 Sub-Accounts to comply with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

Code shall continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified
deferred compensation prior to the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and
shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Plan as in effect
prior to the effective date of Amendment No.&nbsp;4. In particular, to the extent
permitted under AJCA Guidance:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;No additional VAP Deferral Benefits are permitted under the Plan and,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;9.3 of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;SECTION 9.3. Claims and Appeals Procedures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Plan Administrator shall determine the rights of any person to any
Excess Retirement Benefits hereunder. Any person who believes that he has not
received the Excess Retirement Benefits to which he is entitled under the Plan
must file a claim in writing with the Plan Administrator specifying the basis
for his claim and the facts upon which he relies in making such a claim. Such
a claim must be signed by the claimant or his duly authorized representative
(the &#147;Claimant&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Whenever the Plan Administrator denies (in whole or in part) a claim
for benefits under the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall transmit a written
notice of such decision to the Claimant, no later than 90&nbsp;days after the
receipt of a claim (plus an additional period of 90&nbsp;days if required for
processing, provided that notice of the extension of time is given to the
claimant within the first 90&nbsp;day period). Such notice shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant and shall state (i)&nbsp;the
specific reasons for the denial; (ii)&nbsp;specific reference to pertinent Plan
provisions on which the denial is based; (iii)&nbsp;a description of any additional
material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and (iv)&nbsp;an
explanation of the Plan&#146;s claim review procedure and the time limits applicable
thereto (including a statement of the
Claimant&#146;s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA
following an adverse benefit determination on review).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Within 60&nbsp;days after receipt of denial of a claim, the Claimant must
file with the Plan Administrator a written request for a review of such claim.
If such an appeal is not filed within such 60-day period, the Claimant shall be
deemed to have acquiesced in the original decision of the Plan Administrator on
his claim. If such an appeal is so filed within such 60&nbsp;day period, a named
fiduciary designated by the Plan Administrator shall conduct a full and fair
review of such claim. During such review, the Claimant shall be given the
opportunity to review documents that are pertinent to his claim and to submit
issues and comments in writing. For this purpose, the named fiduciary shall
have the same power to interpret the Plan and make findings of fact thereunder
as is given to the Plan Administrator under Section&nbsp;9.1 above. The named
fiduciary shall mail or deliver to the Claimant a written decision on the
matter based on the facts and the pertinent provisions of the Plan within 60
days after the receipt of the request for review (unless special circumstances
require an extension of up to 60 additional days, in which case written notice
of such extension shall be given to the Claimant prior to the commencement of
such extension). Such decision (i)&nbsp;shall be written in a manner calculated to
be understood by the Claimant, (ii)&nbsp;shall state the specific reasons for the
decision and the specific Plan provisions on which the decision was based and
(iii)&nbsp;shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be final and binding on
all interested persons. In addition, the notice of adverse determination shall
also include statements that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request
and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of all documents, records
and other information relevant to the Claimant&#146;s claim for benefits and a
statement of the Claimant&#146;s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a)
of ERISA.&#148;

follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;SECTION 9.6. Termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Board of Directors of the Company (or the Compensation Committee),
in its sole discretion, may terminate this Plan at any time and for any reason
whatsoever, except that, subject to Subsection (b)&nbsp;hereof, (i)&nbsp;no such
termination may adversely affect any Participant&#146;s Excess Retirement Benefit as
of the date of such termination, and (ii)&nbsp;no such termination may suspend the
crediting of earnings on the balance of a Participant&#146;s Account, until the
entire balance of such Account has been distributed, in either case, without
the prior written consent of the affected Participant. Any such termination
shall be expressed in the form of a written instrument executed by an officer
of the Company on the order of the Board (or Compensation Committee, as
applicable). Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Subsection, such
termination shall become effective as of the date specified in such instrument
or, if no such date is specified, on the date of its execution. Written notice
of any termination shall be given to the Participants as soon as practicable
after the instrument is executed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent
permitted under Code Section&nbsp;409A, in the event of a termination of the Plan,
the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion (but with the consent of the
Benefits Committee or the Compensation Committee), shall have the right to
change the time and form of distribution of Participants&#146; Excess Retirement
Benefits, including requiring that all amounts credited to Participant&#146;s
Accounts hereunder be immediately distributed in the form of a lump sum
payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Any Employer (other than the Company) that adopts the Plan may elect
to withdraw from the Plan and such withdrawal shall constitute a termination of
the Plan as to such Employer; provided, however, that such terminating Employer
shall continue to be an Employer for the purposes hereof as to Participants or
Beneficiaries to whom it owes obligations hereunder. Such withdrawal and
termination shall be expressed in an instrument executed by the terminating
Employer on authority of its Board of Directors (or the applicable Committee
thereof) and filed with the Company, and shall become effective as of the date
designated in such instrument or, if no such date is specified, on the date of
its execution. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if an Employer
(other than the Company) ceases to be a member of the Controlled Group, to the
extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A, the Plan shall automatically terminate
with respect to such Employer and all amounts credited to the Accounts of
Employees of such Employer shall be immediately payable in the form of a lump
sum payment.&#148;
