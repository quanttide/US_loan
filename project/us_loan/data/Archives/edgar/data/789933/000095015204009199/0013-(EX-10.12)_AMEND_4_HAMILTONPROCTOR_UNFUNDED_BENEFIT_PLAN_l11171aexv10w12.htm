<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted an
amended and restated Unfunded Benefit Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) effective as of October
1, 2001 and has since amended the Plan; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.1 of the Plan, all amounts credited to a
Participant&#146;s Account under the Plan are 100% vested; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A and the AJCA
Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of the Excess
Benefits that were deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to the Plan,
which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 (including any earnings thereon) to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and
continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation, and the terms of the Plan as in effect, prior to the addition of
Code Section&nbsp;409A and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 to be
deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;I of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new Section&nbsp;1.5 to the
end thereof, to read as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;It is intended that the Plan (including all Amendments thereto) comply
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as enacted by AJCA, so as to
prevent the inclusion in gross income of any Excess Benefit hereunder in a
taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts
would otherwise actually be distributed or made available to the Participants.
The Plan shall be administered in a manner that will comply with Section&nbsp;409A
of the Code, including any proposed, temporary or final

the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto (collectively with the AJCA,
the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;). Any Plan provisions (including, without limitation,
those added or amended by Amendment No.&nbsp;4) that would cause the Plan to fail to

rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in connection therewith to

Amendment No.&nbsp;4 also modifies the distribution elections and provisions for the

continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation prior to the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and shall be

of December&nbsp;31, 2004 including, to the extent permitted by the AJCA Guidance,
the Excess Profit Sharing Benefit for the 2004 Plan Year (which is allocated to
the Participants&#146; Accounts in 2005), shall be credited to Participant&#146;s
Grandfathered Sub-Account; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;All Excess Pension Benefits were permanently frozen as of January&nbsp;1,

Added Contribution is credited to a Participant&#146;s Excess Employer Added
Sub-Account (with the timing of such election complying with the
requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A), a Participant shall be required to
make an election regarding the time of the commencement of payment of the
Participant&#146;s entire Excess Employer Added Sub-Account hereunder. The
Participant may elect to commence payment of his Excess Employer Added
Sub-Account on (1)&nbsp;the date on which he incurs a Termination of
Employment, (2)&nbsp;the January 1st of the year following the date on which he
incurs a Termination of Employment, (3)&nbsp;the date he attains a specified
age or (4)&nbsp;the earlier of such dates; provided, however, that with respect
to a Key Employee, a distribution on account of Termination of Employment
may not be made before the date which is six months after the date of the
Key Employee&#146;s Termination of Employment (or, if earlier, the date of
death), to the extent that Code Section&nbsp;409A(a)(2)(B)(i) is applicable. A
Participant who does not timely and properly file such an election form
shall be deemed to have elected to receive his Excess Employer Added
Sub-Account on the date of his Termination of Employment.

who is an Employee may elect to change the payment date selected (or
deemed selected) for his Excess Employer Added Sub-Account to one of the
other dates permitted under (i)&nbsp;above; provided, however that such an
election change will not be effective unless (1)&nbsp;it is made not less than
twelve months prior to the original payment date, (2)&nbsp;the first payment
under such election will be made no less than five years from the original
payment date and (3)&nbsp;such election will not take effect until at least
twelve months after the date on which such election is made.&#148;
