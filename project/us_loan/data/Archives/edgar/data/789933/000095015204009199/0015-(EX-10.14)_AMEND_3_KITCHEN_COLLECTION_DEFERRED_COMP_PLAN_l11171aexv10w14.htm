and restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Management Employees (the &#147;Plan&#148;)
effective November&nbsp;1, 2001 and has since amended the Plan; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.1 of the Plan, all amounts credited to a
Participant&#146;s Account under the Plan are 100% vested; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A and the AJCA
Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of the Excess
Retirement Benefits that were deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;3 to the Plan,
which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 (including any earnings thereon) to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and
continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation, and the terms of the Plan as in effect, prior to the addition of
Code Section&nbsp;409A and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 to be
deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;It is intended that the Plan (including all Amendments thereto) comply
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as enacted by AJCA, so as to
prevent the inclusion in gross income of any Excess Retirement Benefit
hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which
such amounts would otherwise actually be distributed or made available to the
Participants. The Plan shall be administered in a manner that will comply with
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, including any proposed, temporary or final

provisions (including, without limitation, those added or amended by Amendment
No.&nbsp;3) that would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy Section&nbsp;409A of the Code
shall have no force and effect until amended to comply with Code
Section&nbsp;409A (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by the AJCA
Guidance).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Plan Administrator shall not take any action that would violate

409A and the AJCA Guidance. The Plan Administrator is authorized to adopt
rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in connection therewith to

Administrator is authorized to permit Participant elections with respect to
amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 and is also permitted to allow the
Participants the right to amend or revoke such elections in accordance with the

Guidance) as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and earnings thereon) (collectively, the
&#147;Grandfathered Sub-Accounts&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;to reflect amounts that are deferred
after December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and earnings thereon) (the &#147;Post-2004 Sub-Accounts&#148;).
Amendment No.&nbsp;3 also modifies the distribution elections and provisions for the
Post-2004 Sub-Accounts to comply with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;In furtherance of, but without limiting the foregoing and except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, any Excess Retirement Benefit that is
deemed to have been deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 and that qualifies for
&#147;grandfathered status&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall continue to be
governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to
the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and shall be subject to the terms and
conditions specified in the Plan as in effect prior to the effective date of
Amendment No.&nbsp;3. In particular, to the extent permitted under AJCA Guidance:
