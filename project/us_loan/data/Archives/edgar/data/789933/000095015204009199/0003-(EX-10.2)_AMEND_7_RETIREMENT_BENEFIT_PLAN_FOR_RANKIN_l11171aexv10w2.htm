<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AMENDMENT NO. 7<BR>
TO THE RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN<BR>
FOR ALFRED M. RANKIN, JR.<BR>
(As Amended and Restated Effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1994)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, NACCO Industries, Inc. (the &#147;Employer&#148;) originally adopted the
Retirement Benefit Plan for Alfred M. Rankin Jr. (the &#147;Plan&#148;) effective as of
March&nbsp;1, 1989 and has since amended the Plan; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Employer hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;7 to the
Plan, which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2005 to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and continue to be
governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to
the addition of Code Section&nbsp;409A (as specified in the Plan as in effect before
the adoption of this Amendment No.&nbsp;7) and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after
December&nbsp;31, 2004 to be deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code
Section&nbsp;409A.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Words used herein with initial capital letters which are defined in the Plan
are used herein as so defined.



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;I of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new Section&nbsp;1.5 to the
end thereof, to read as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;Section&nbsp;1.5. American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;It is intended that the Plan (including any Amendments thereto) comply
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as enacted by the AJCA, so as
to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any amount credited to the
Participant&#146;s Account hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable
year or years in which such amounts would otherwise be actually distributed or
made available to the Participant. The Plan shall be administered in a manner
that will comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, including proposed, temporary
or final regulations

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">or any other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal
Revenue Service with respect thereto (collectively with the AJCA, the &#147;AJCA
Guidance&#148;). Any Plan provision that would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code (including, without limitation, any provisions of this
Amendment No.&nbsp;6) shall have no force and effect until amended to comply with
Code Section&nbsp;409A (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted
by the AJCA Guidance).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Neither the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Employer (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) nor the NACCO Industries, Inc. Benefits
Committee shall take any action hereunder that would violate any provision of
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. It is intended that the Participant&#146;s elections
hereunder for amounts deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 will comply with Code
Section&nbsp;409A and the AJCA Guidance. The Compensation Committee is authorized
to adopt rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in connection
therewith to anticipate and/or comply with the requirements thereof (including
any transition or grandfather rules thereunder).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The effective date of this Amendment No.&nbsp;7 is January&nbsp;1, 2005. As
stated below, this Amendment creates two separate Sub-Accounts for the
Participant &#151; (i)&nbsp;the &#147;Grandfathered Sub-Account&#148; for amounts that are
&#147;deferred&#148; (as such term is defined in the AJCA Guidance) as of December&nbsp;31,
2004 (and earnings thereon) and (ii)&nbsp;the &#147;Post-2004 Sub-Account&#148; for amounts
that are deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and earnings thereon). This
Amendment also modifies the distribution elections for the Post-2004
Sub-Account to comply with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A. In
furtherance of, but without limiting the foregoing, any Supplemental Benefit
(and the earnings thereon) that are deemed to have been deferred prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2005 and that qualify for &#147;grandfathered status&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A
of the Code shall continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified
deferred compensation prior to the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the Code and
shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Plan as in effect
prior to the effective date of this Amendment No.&nbsp;7. In particular, to the
extent permitted under AJCA Guidance, the provisions of the Plan as in effect
prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 shall govern the Supplemental Benefits that are earned
during 2004, but credited to the Participant&#146;s Account in 2005.&#148;

2004 (and earnings thereon) and (b)&nbsp;the &#147;Post-2004 Sub-Account&#148; for amounts
that are deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and earnings thereon).&#148;

Section&nbsp;5.2 to the end thereof, to read as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Section&nbsp;5.2 shall apply solely to distributions of
amounts that are allocated to a Participant&#146;s Post-2004 Sub-Account.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Time of Payment. The Participant may irrevocably elect (at the time
specified, and otherwise in accordance with, the requirements of Code Section
409A) to receive the Supplemental Benefit that is allocable to his Post-2004
Sub-Account as soon as practicable following one of the following dates: (i)
the date on which he ceases to be employed by the Controlled Group, (ii)
January 1 of the year following the date on which he ceases to be employed by
the Controlled Group; (iii)&nbsp;the date on which he attains an age specified in
the election form; (iv)&nbsp;January 1 of the year following the date on which he

any two such dates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1)&nbsp;distribution may not
commence until the Participant incurs a &#147;separation from service&#148; (as defined
in Code Section&nbsp;409A) and (2)&nbsp;if the Participant is a Key Employee (as defined
in Section 416(i) of the Code (without regard to paragraph (5)&nbsp;thereof)) of the
Employer, payment may not be made before the date that is 6&nbsp;months after the
date of such separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death) to the
extent that Code Section&nbsp;409A(a)(2)(B)(i) is applicable. If the Participant

Benefit attributable to his Post-2004 Sub-Account shall be distributed to the
Participant in accordance with clause (i)&nbsp;of the first sentence of this
Subsection (subject to the limitations of the second sentence hereof). Once
made, the election (or deemed election) of a time of payment shall be

accordance with, the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A) to receive the
Supplemental Benefit that is allocable to his Post-2004 Sub-Account in the form
of a lump sum payment or in the form of annual installment payments (for 10
years or such other time period as elected by the Participant), with the
installment payments (if any) being calculated in accordance with the rules
specified in Section&nbsp;5.1. Any form of payment election must be in writing (on
a form provided by the Secretary of the Employer) and filed with the Secretary
of the Employer. If the Participant does not make a timely election regarding
the form of payment, his Supplemental Benefit attributable to his Post-2004
Sub-Account shall be distributed to the Executive in the form of a single lump
sum payment. Once made, the election (or deemed election) of a form of payment
under this Section&nbsp;5.2 shall be irrevocable except as specified in Section
5.2(b)(ii) below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may change his form of
payment election (or deemed election) by filing a subsequent written election
with the Secretary of the Employer. However, such election will not be

five years from the date payment would have been made absent such election
(excluding distributions made on account of the death of the Participant), and
(3)&nbsp;such election will not take effect until at least 12&nbsp;months after the date
on which the election is made.

Participant, to the extent permitted under Code Section&nbsp;409A, his Beneficiary
shall receive a lump sum distribution of the balance of the Participant&#146;s
Post-2004 Sub-Account as soon as practicable after the Participant&#146;s death.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A,
the Participant may elect an alternate form of payment for his Beneficiary,

the Employer may at any time, upon written request of the Participant, cause to
be paid to such Participant an amount equal to all or any part of the
Participant&#146;s Post-2004 Sub-Account if the Employer determines, based on such
reasonable evidence as it shall require, that such a payment or payments is
necessary for the purpose of alleviating the consequences of an Unforeseeable
Emergency. Payments made on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be
permitted only to the extent the amount does not exceed the amount necessary to
satisfy the emergency need (plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably
anticipated as a result of the distribution) and may not be made to the extent
such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant&#146;s
assets (to the extent such liquidation would not itself cause severe financial
hardship.&#148;
