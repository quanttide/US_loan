TO<BR>
THE NORTH AMERICAN COAL CORPORATION<BR>

WITH RESPECT TO<BR>
THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, The North American Coal Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) adopted The
North American Coal Corporation Value Appreciation Plan for Years 2000 to 2009
(the &#147;Plan&#148;) effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2000; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Plan is classified as a &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation
plan&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;)
added a new Section&nbsp;409A to the Code, which significantly changed the Federal
tax law applicable to &#147;amounts deferred&#148; under the Plan after December&nbsp;31,
2004; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the AJCA, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will issue proposed, temporary or final regulations
and/or other guidance with respect to the provisions of new Section&nbsp;409A of the
Code (collectively, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the AJCA Guidance has not yet been issued; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to the fullest extent permitted by Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and
the AJCA Guidance, the Company wants to protect the &#147;grandfathered&#148; status of
VAP Awards that are deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, the Company hereby adopts this Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to the Plan,
which amendment is intended to (1)&nbsp;allow amounts deferred prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 to qualify for &#147;grandfathered&#148; status and continue to be governed by the
law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to the addition of
Section&nbsp;409A to the Code (as specified in the Plan as in effect prior to the
adoption of this Amendment No.&nbsp;1) and (2)&nbsp;cause amounts deferred after December
31, 2004 to be deferred in compliance with the requirements of Code Section
409A.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1 of the Plan is hereby amended by the addition of the following
new Section&nbsp;1A to the end thereof, to read as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;1A <B>AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT (AJCA)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;It is intended that the Plan (including any Amendments thereto) comply
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as enacted by the AJCA, so as
to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any amount credited to a
Participant&#146;s VAP Account hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the
taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise be actually
distributed or made available to the Participant. The Plan shall be
administered in a manner that will comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code,
including proposed, temporary or final regulations or any other guidance issued
by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect
thereto (collectively with the AJCA, the &#147;AJCA Guidance&#148;). Any Plan provision
that would cause the Plan to fail to satisfy Section&nbsp;409A of the Code
(including any provision added by Amendment No.&nbsp;1 thereto) shall have no force
and effect until amended to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A (which amendment may
be retroactive to the extent permitted by the AJCA Guidance).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Committee shall not take any action that would violate any
provision of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. The Committee is authorized to adopt
rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with the
AJCA Guidance to anticipate and/or comply with the requirements thereof
(including any transition or grandfather rules thereunder).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The effective date of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to the Plan is January&nbsp;1, 2005.
Amendment No.&nbsp;1 creates two separate Sub-Accounts for each Participant&#146;s VAP
Account hereunder &#151; (i)&nbsp;the &#147;Pre-2005 Sub-Account&#148; for amounts that are
&#147;deferred&#148; (as such terms is defined in the AJCA Guidance) as of December&nbsp;31,
2004 (and earnings thereon) and (ii)&nbsp;the &#147;Post-2004 Sub-Account&#148; for amounts
that are deferred after December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and earnings thereon).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;In furtherance of, but without limiting the foregoing, any Award that
is deemed to have been deferred prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 and that qualifies for
&#147;grandfathered status&#148; under
Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall continue to be governed by the law applicable to
nonqualified deferred compensation prior to the addition of Section&nbsp;409A to the
Code and shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Plan as
in effect prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005. In particular, to the extent permitted
under the AJCA Guidance, all Awards that were issued (and, only if required
under the AJCA Guidance, vested) prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 shall be considered
&#147;grandfathered&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, shall be allocated to the
Participants&#146; Pre-2005 Sub-Account and shall be paid under the terms of the
Plan as in effect prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2 of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new Subsection (aa)&nbsp;to
the beginning thereof, to read as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;(aa) &#147;Account&#148; means the account established in accordance with Section&nbsp;7
hereof to reflect the Participant&#146;s interest under the Plan. The Participant&#146;s
Account shall be further divided into the following two Sub-Accounts: (i)&nbsp;the
&#147;Pre-2005 Sub-Account&#148; for amounts that are &#147;deferred&#148; (as such term is defined
in the AJCA Guidance) as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 (and
