Item 5.03  Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation

     On December 27, 2004 the Registrant filed a Certificate of Amendment to
its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware.
The Certificate of Amendment amended the Certificate of Incorporation thus:

1.   The corporate name of the Registrant was changed from "Telco-Technology,
Inc." to "GreenWorks Corporation."

2.   There was a reverse split of the outstanding common stock on a 1-for-50
basis, effective at 8:00 P.M. on December 28, 2004.  The Registrant will
purchase fractional shares resulting from the reverse split on the basis of
$1.70 per share.

     Beginning on December 29, 2004, the company's common stock will be listed
on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "GRWK."

     As a result of the reverse stock split, on December 29, 2004 there will
be approximately 2,669,398 shares of common stock outstanding, the precise
number depending on the number of fractional shares that result from the
reverse split.
