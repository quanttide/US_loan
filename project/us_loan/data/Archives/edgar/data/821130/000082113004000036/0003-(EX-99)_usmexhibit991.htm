Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The
company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets will
not change. The restatement will reflect only a reclassification between Cash Flows From
Financing Activities and Cash Flows From Operating Activities. The restatement will have
no effect on U.S. Cellular&#146;s Net increase in cash and cash equivalents. </FONT></P>

and Cash Flows From Operating Activities will decrease by $68.1 million from $383.8
million to $315.8 million. </FONT></P>
