Section 409A                     of the Code and the related Treasury Regulations. An
unforeseeable emergency                     means a severe financial hardship to the
Executive resulting from an illness or                     accident of the Executive, the
Executive&#146;s spouse or a dependent (as                     defined in Section 152(a)
of the Code) of the Executive, loss of the                     Executive&#146;s property
due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and                     unforeseeable
circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of                     the
Executive.  </FONT></TD>

The circumstances that will constitute an emergency will depend
                    upon the facts of each case, but,
in any case, payment may not exceed an amount                     necessary to satisfy
such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes                     reasonably
anticipated as a result of such payment after taking into account the
                    extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved (a) through
reimbursement or                     compensation by insurance or otherwise or (b) by
liquidation of the                     Executive&#146;s assets, to the extent the
liquidation of such assets would not                     itself cause severe financial
hardship. Examples of what are not considered to                     be unforeseeable
emergencies include the need to send an Executive&#146;s child                     to
college or the desire to purchase a home.  </FONT></TD>
