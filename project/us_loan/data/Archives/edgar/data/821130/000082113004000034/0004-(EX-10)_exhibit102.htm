In
the event of an unforeseeable emergency, the Executive may make withdrawals
                    from the vested amounts in the Deferred Compensation Account but only
in                     accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the related Treasury
Regulations.                     An unforeseeable emergency means a severe financial
hardship to the Executive                     resulting from an illness or accident of
the Executive, the Executive&#146;s                     spouse or a dependent (as defined
in Section 152(a) of the Code) of the                     Executive, loss of the Executive&#146;s
property due to casualty, or other                     similar extraordinary and
unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of                     events beyond the
control of the Executive. The circumstances that will                     constitute an
emergency will depend upon the facts of each case, but, in any                     case,
payment may not exceed an amount necessary to satisfy such emergency plus
                    amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of
such                     payment after taking into account the extent to which such
hardship is or may be                     relieved (a) through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise or                     (b) by liquidation of the
Executive&#146;s assets, to the extent the liquidation                     of such assets
would not itself cause severe financial hardship. Examples of                     what
are not considered to be unforeseeable emergencies include the need to send
                    an Executive&#146;s child to college or the desire to purchase a
home.  </FONT></TD>
