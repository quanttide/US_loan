CASH PROFIT SHARING PLAN



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Core Molding has a cash profit sharing plan for its management, salaried and non-represented
employees which is calculated as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s Board of Directors establishes thresholds for Earnings Before Taxes (&#147;EBT&#148;) for each
fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A profit sharing pool will be created based upon percentages of EBT for each fiscal year ended
December&nbsp;31, above the thresholds which will be shared with the permanent salaried employees and
non-represented employees in the form of profit sharing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A total profit sharing pool is limited to a maximum percentage of EBT as established by the Board
of Directors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The profit sharing pool is split into three groups, an &#147;executive&#148; group, a &#147;salary&#148; group and a
&#147;non-represented&#148; group. The executive group consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Vice President of Sales and Marketing, and the Vice President of Operations
&#150; Columbus.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The executive group shares in 25% of the pool while the remaining salary group shares in 60% of the
pool. The non-represented group shares in 15% of the pool.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Employees must have been employed as of December&nbsp;31 of each year to be eligible to participate.
There is no pro-rating for terminated employees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors reserves the right to change the plan as deemed necessary.
