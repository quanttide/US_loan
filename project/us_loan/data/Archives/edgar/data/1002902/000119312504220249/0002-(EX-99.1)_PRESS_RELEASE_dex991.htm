SIZE="2">MINNEAPOLIS, MN, December 28, 2004&#151;Velocity Express Corporation (NASDAQ:VEXEC) (the &#147;Company&#148;) today announced the receipt on December 22, 2004 of a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff, which notified the
Company that its common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market pursuant to exceptions from the filing, proxy solicitation, annual shareholders&#146; meeting and bid price requirements in Nasdaq Marketplace Rules 4310(c)(14),
4350(e), 4350(g) and 4310(c)(4), respectively. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company failed to timely
file its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2004 (the &#147;10-K&#148;), and also failed to timely file its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 (the &#147;10-Q&#148;). The Company also failed to hold its annual
shareholders&#146; meeting for fiscal year 2003. Finally, the Company has a commitment to Nasdaq to seek, at its next shareholders&#146; meeting to be held no later than January 20, 2005, shareholder approval of a reverse stock split to address the
Company&#146;s deficiency in meeting its required minimum bid price. The Company discussed these matters at a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the &#147;Panel&#148;) on November 18, 2004. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Panel has granted the Company temporary exceptions to its listing requirements subject to
the Company meeting certain conditions. On or before January 14, 2005, the Company must file the delinquent 10-K and 10-Q. Furthermore, on or before February 15, 2005, the Company must (a) file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending on or about
December 31, 2004; (b) solicit proxies and hold a shareholders&#146; meetings for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, and to approve the reverse stock split; and (c) evidence a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share, and, immediately thereafter, a
closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days. The Panel has reserved the ability to require that the Company maintain the minimum bid price for a period in excess of 10 days before determining that the
Company has satisfied this condition. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">All companies on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market operating under exceptions are identified by the appendage of a &#147;C&#148; to their trading symbol. Accordingly, as of open of business on December 27, 2004, the trading symbol for the Company is &#147;VEXEC.&#148; The &#147;E&#148; and
&#147;C&#148; will be removed from the Company&#146;s trading symbol upon the Panel&#146;s determination that the Company has complied with the Nasdaq filing requirements and all terms of the exceptions described above. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On December 23, 2005 the Company filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2004.
The Company intends to file an amended Form 10-K relative only to the beneficial ownership tables in Item 12 of Part III. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the event the Panel ultimately finds that the Company has met these conditions, the Company shall continue to be listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. The Company is
working diligently with its auditors to meet these conditions, but there can be no assurance it will do so. The Company may subsequently need to request additional time to solicit proxies and hold its shareholders&#146; meeting for good cause, such
as, for example, SEC review. </FONT></P>
