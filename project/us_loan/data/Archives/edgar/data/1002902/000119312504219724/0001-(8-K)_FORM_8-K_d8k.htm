Agreement&#148;) with certain institutional and accredited investors (the &#147;Investors&#148;). Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 6% Convertible Notes (the &#147;Notes&#148;) in the aggregate principal amount of $21,000,000, which
will be convertible into Series M Preferred Stock of the Company upon stockholder approval of an increase in the Company&#146;s authorized share capital, a reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s Common Stock and certain other matters. The number
of shares of Series M Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes represent approximately 29% of the equity capital of the Company after giving effect to the transaction. Approximately $18 million of the Notes was placed with three lead
institutional investors and the remaining $3 million of Notes was placed with TH Lee Putnam Ventures and its affiliates, Vincent Wasik, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, and other accredited investors. The sale of the Notes closed
effective December 21, 2004 and was funded on December 22, 2004 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Notes), the Company must repurchase the Notes at the option of each holder. The Notes convert automatically into shares of Series M Preferred Stock upon stockholder approval of the transaction. Prior to
the approval of the issuance of the Notes by the Company&#146;s stockholders, the Notes are not convertible into shares of Series M Preferred Stock. The conversion price per share for the Notes equals .0737 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock, on a fully-diluted basis (including Common Stock and debt, preferred stock, rights options and warrants convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock(but excluding options or
warrants with an exercise price of $0.51 per share or more)) existing on the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis existing as of the conversion date.

completion of the appropriate corporate actions, such as holding a stockholder vote and filing an amended certificate of incorporation. Under the Voting Agreements, the stockholders agreed to vote in favor of approval of the transaction contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement and several other proposals. The other proposals include (i) approval of prior commitments to issue series of preferred stock, (ii) approval of amendments of the terms of each series of preferred stock to add mandatory
conversion of the series into shares of Common Stock in the event the Series B Preferred Stock converts into Common Stock, (iii) approval of the proposed reverse stock split, and (iv) approval of a waiver of any adjustment to the conversion price
for any series of preferred stock based on the issuance of the Series M Preferred Stock. If these proposals are adopted by the Company&#146;s stockholders as contemplated by the Voting Agreement, the Company&#146;s existing classes of preferred
stock will be converted into shares of common stock without any adjustment to the conversion price based on the issuance of the Series M Preferred Stock. As a result, the Series M Preferred Stock will be the only class of preferred stock to remain

lenders of such decision and provide specific levels of financial support for a thirty (30) day period following the notification. In exchange for entering in to the capital contribution agreement, the lenders agreed to waive certain financial
covenants under the Company&#146;s credit facilities. At the time, THLPV did not receive any compensation in exchange for entering into the capital contribution agreement. As part of the extension of the capital contribution agreement the Company
agreed to issue to THLPV, subject to shareholder approval, a warrant to purchase shares of common stock equal to 1% of the fully diluted common stock of the Company on a fully converted basis. The term of the warrant will be five years and will have

21, 2004, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, pending shareholder approval, 7,000,000 shares of Series L Preferred to THKPV for $1.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $7.0 million. The consideration for the Series L will consist
of cancellation of the Company&#146;s obligation to repay THLPV the funds paid by THLPV to the Company&#146;s senior lender to support the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility. The issuance of the Series L Preferred is subject to shareholder
approval and is non-voting unless it is converted into common stock. Additionally, shareholder approval is required to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company&#146;s common stock by an amount sufficient to provide for the issuance of
all the preferred shares. The conversion price of the Series L Preferred is $0.10 per common share, and, if the Series L Preferred were issued and convertible then, each share of Series L Preferred will be convertible into ten shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock. Based on the pricing of the Series L Preferred, the sale of Series L Preferred is expected to contain a beneficial conversion amounting to $7.0 million which will be recognized as a deemed dividend to preferred
