ITEM 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement


On December 16, 2004, Nordstrom Private Label Receivables, LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Nordstrom Credit, Inc., amended the Note Purchase Agreement
dated December 4, 2001 between Nordstrom Private Label Receivables, LLC,
Nordstrom fsb, Falcon Asset Securitization Corporation, and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, NA (successor-by-merger to Bank One, NA (Main Office Chicago)), as
agent.  The Note Purchase Agreement governs how Nordstrom Credit, Inc. can
borrow from the $150 million variable funding note.  This fifth amendment to
the Note Purchase Agreement reflects that Nordstrom fsb has the ability to
borrow up to $150 million under its own Note Purchase Agreement.  The total
amount available to both Nordstrom Credit, Inc. and Nordstrom fsb cannot
exceed $150 million.  Both Nordstrom Credit, Inc. and Nordstrom fsb are wholly
owned subsidiaries of Nordstrom, Inc.
