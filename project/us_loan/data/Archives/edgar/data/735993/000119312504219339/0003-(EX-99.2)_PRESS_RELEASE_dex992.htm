FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>SAN DIEGO, CA &#150; December 23, 2004</B> <B>&#150;</B> BakBone Software, Inc. (TSX: BKB; OTCBB: BKBOE) announced today that the Company and its management team concluded that the Company&#146;s previously issued
fiscal 2004 audited financial statements must be restated. The restatement is due to an error in the calculation of a non-cash beneficial conversion feature related to the Company&#146;s shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock sold in July
2003 at a price that was less than the market value of the Company&#146;s underlying common stock. The Company and KPMG LLP, the Company&#146;s former independent registered public accounting firm, have determined that the calculation of the
beneficial conversion feature amount was in error, requiring a restatement of its previously issued fiscal 2004 financial statements, as discussed herein and further discussed in the Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The amount of the beneficial conversion feature should have been determined
based on the date the Company received shareholder approval for the issuance of the preferred stock, as opposed to the date the Company formally entered into the preferred stock financing arrangement with the preferred shareholder. In addition, the
amount of the beneficial conversion feature was improperly allocated between the preferred stock and the underlying beneficial conversion feature. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The restated amount for the non-cash beneficial conversion feature is expected to be $13.6 million as compared to the previously reported amount of $7.2 million and
affects the Company&#146;s statement of operations as an increase in the net loss attributable to common shareholders and net loss per common share in the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2004. </FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;This is an unfortunate and unintentional error in our audited financial statements,&#148; said Jim Johnson,
BakBone&#146;s president and CEO. &#147;This amount is non-cash and it will increase, by an identical amount, share capital in equity and BakBone&#146;s accumulated deficit. As such, this non-cash amount will not affect the total shareholders&#146;
equity previously reported. It is important to point out that revenues, operating expenses and gross margins as previously reported for fiscal year 2004 will not be affected by this change.&#148; </FONT></P> <P

recognized during the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004, the final quarter reviewed by KPMG in its capacity as the Company&#146;s independent auditor, was recorded in error.&#148; said John Fitzgerald, BakBone&#146;s CFO. &#147;This revenue
was recorded by the Company specific to a single customer upon the execution of a contract amendment with that customer in April 2004. KPMG has stated that it believes the related amount should have been recorded in deferred revenue on the
Company&#146;s balance sheet as of June 30, 2004. At present, we are reviewing KPMG&#146;s comment on this item and we have not yet completed our assessment of the revenue recognition on the related amount which is estimated to not exceed
$500,000.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Management has dedicated all possible resources to complete
its review of and file the interim financial statements for the second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. However, in the process of conducting this review the Company determined that, prior to the filing of these financial statements, it was
necessary to evaluate additional accounting areas. In addition to the identification of the error in the calculation of the non-recurring, non-cash amount associated with its Series A convertible preferred shares, the Company is performing
additional analysis surrounding the review and determination of the fair value of the various software components that it sells, the allocation of discounts provided to customers and the resulting revenue recognized as determined by following the
applicable software revenue recognition guidance pertaining to these two areas. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Added Johnson, &#147;This has been an extremely frustrating and time-consuming process, not only for the Company, but for our shareholders. However, with the accounting issues now on the table, we are hopefully in a position to finalize
this process and release our financial results for the September 30 quarter in January, 2005.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Johnson further stated, &#147;To those who ask the question of what is happening in our underlying business that is causing the current delay, I respond that our fundamental business has not driven the delays that we
are working through. Rather, this delay is being driven by both the unintentional error as well as the additional review we are performing.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
