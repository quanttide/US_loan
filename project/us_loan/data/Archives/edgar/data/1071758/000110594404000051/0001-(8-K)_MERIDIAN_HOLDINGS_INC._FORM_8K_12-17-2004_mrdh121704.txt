no  disagreements  with  the  accounting  firm  of  Andrew  M.  Smith,  CPA, on
any matter of accounting principle or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedure,  which  disagreement(s),  if  any,  not resolved
to  the  satisfaction of the accounting firm  of  Andrew  M.  Smith,  CPA, would
have caused the accounting firm of  Andrew  M.  Smith,  CPA to make  a reference
to the subject matter of  the disagreement(s)  in  connection  with  his report.

(v)  Effective  December  17,  2004,   the  Company  has  appointed  Madsen  and

to  any specific  transactions,  either completed  or proposed,  or the type  of
audit opinion  that  might  be  rendered  with  respect  to  the  Company's
financial statements  prior  to  his  engagement.

(vii)  The Company  has requested that the accounting firm of Andrew  M.  Smith,
CPA  review  the  disclosure  in  this  report  and  that  it  has  been   given
the opportunity to furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Commission
