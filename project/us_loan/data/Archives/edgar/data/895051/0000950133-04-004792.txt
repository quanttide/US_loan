on Form 10-K pursuant to Section&nbsp;13 or 15(d) under the Exchange Act.

this <U>Section&nbsp;4.1(b)</U>, of the following legend on any certificate evidencing
Securities:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certificates evidencing Securities shall not be required to contain such legend

interpretations and pronouncements issued by the Staff of the Commission). The
Company shall deliver the Transfer Agent Instructions to the Transfer Agent on

than three Trading Days following the delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or
the Transfer Agent of a legended certificate representing such Securities,
deliver or cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a certificate representing
such Securities that is free from all restrictive and other legends. Following
the Effective Date and upon the delivery to any Purchaser of any certificate
representing Securities that is free from all restrictive and other legends,
such Purchaser agrees that any sale of such Securities shall be made pursuant

time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the Securities in
connection with a bona fide margin agreement or other loan or financing
arrangement secured by the Securities and, if required under the terms of such
agreement, loan or arrangement, such Purchaser may transfer pledged or secured
Securities to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer would
not be subject to approval of the Company and no legal opinion of the pledgee,
secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection therewith. Further,
no notice shall be required of such pledge. At the appropriate Purchaser&#146;s
expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as
a pledgee or secured party of Securities may reasonably request in connection
with a pledge or transfer of the Securities, including the preparation and
filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule&nbsp;424(b)(3) of the
Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to
appropriately amend the list of selling stockholders thereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, agrees that the removal of
the restrictive legend from certificates representing Securities as set forth
in this Section&nbsp;4.1 is predicated upon such Purchaser delivering a certificate
executed by such Purchaser in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;E</U>. Each
Purchaser further covenants and agrees that it is familiar with the SEC&#146;s
Manual of Telephone Interpretation item A.65 respecting such Purchaser&#146;s
inability to directly cover any short sale made prior to the Effective Date
with any Registrable Securities, and agrees to comply with the same.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 <U>Furnishing of Information</U>. As long as any Purchaser owns Securities,
the Company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof
and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed
by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act. Upon the
request of any Purchaser, the Company shall deliver to such Purchaser a written
certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with
the preceding sentence. As long as any Purchaser owns Securities, if the
Company is not required to file reports pursuant to such laws, it will prepare
and furnish to the Purchasers and make publicly available in accordance with
paragraph (c)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;144 such information as is required for the Purchasers to
sell the Securities under Rule&nbsp;144. The Company further covenants that it will
take such further action as any holder of Securities may reasonably request to
satisfy the provisions of Rule&nbsp;144 applicable to the issuer of securities
relating to transactions for the sale of securities pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3 <U>Integration</U>. The Company shall not, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that no Affiliate of the Company shall, sell, offer for sale
or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as
defined in Section&nbsp;2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the

Purchaser may, at its sole option and in its sole discretion,
reduce the number or amount of the Offered Securities specified in

the number or amount of the Offered Securities that the Purchaser
elected to purchase pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1(b)(ii) above multiplied
by a fraction, (i)&nbsp;the numerator of which shall be the number or
amount of Offered Securities the Company actually proposes to
issue, sell or exchange (including Offered Securities to be issued

before 9:30 a.m., New York time, on the next business day following the
execution of this Agreement, issue a press release acceptable to the Purchasers
disclosing all material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the
Commission (the &#147;<B>8-K Filing</B>&#148;) within the time period required thereby
describing the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents and including as exhibits to such Current Report on Form 8-K this
Agreement and the form of Warrants, in the form required by the Exchange Act.
Thereafter, the Company shall timely file any filings and notices required by
the Commission or applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and provide copies thereof to the Purchasers promptly after filing.
Except with respect to the 8-K Filing and the press release referenced above (a
copy of which will be provided to the Purchasers for their review as early as
practicable prior to its filing), the Company shall, at least two Trading Days
prior to the filing or dissemination of any disclosure required by this
paragraph, provide a copy thereof to the Purchasers for their review. The
Company and the Purchasers shall consult with each other in issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public statements or filings and other
communications with the Commission or any regulatory agency or Trading Market
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither party shall
issue any such press release or otherwise make any such public statement,
filing or other communication without the prior consent of the other, except if
such disclosure is required by law, in which case the disclosing party shall
promptly provide the other party with prior notice of such public statement,
filing or other communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not publicly disclose the name of any Purchaser, or include the name of
any Purchaser in any filing with the Commission or any regulatory agency or
Trading Market, without the prior written consent of such Purchaser, except to
the extent such disclosure is required by law or Trading Market regulations, in

hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled, without the
prior approval of any Purchaser, to make any press release or other public
disclosure with respect to such transactions (i)&nbsp;in substantial conformity with

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.7 <U>Use of Proceeds</U>. The Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale
of the Securities hereunder for working capital purposes and not for the
satisfaction of any portion of the Company&#146;s debt (other than payment of trade
payables and accrued expenses in the ordinary course of the Company&#146;s business
and consistent with prior practices), to redeem any Company equity or
equity-equivalent securities or to settle any outstanding litigation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.8 <U>Reimbursement</U>. The Company will indemnify and hold each Purchaser and
its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, shareholders,
partners, members, employees and agents (each, a &#147;<B>Related Person</B>&#148;) harmless
from any and all Losses that any such Related Person incurs as a result of or
relating to: (a)&nbsp;any breach, or any allegation by a third party that, if true,
would constitute a breach, of any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement or in the other Transaction
Documents; or (b)&nbsp;any Proceeding brought or made against such Related Person
and arising primarily out of or primarily resulting from the execution,
delivery, performance or enforcement of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents and without causation by any other activity, obligation,
condition or liability pertaining to such Purchaser. The Company will
reimburse each such Related Person for its reasonable legal and other expenses
(including the cost of any investigation, preparation and travel in connection
therewith) incurred in connection therewith, as such expenses are incurred.
The conduct of any Proceedings for which indemnification is available under
this Section&nbsp;4.8 shall be governed by Section&nbsp;6.4(c) below. The
indemnification obligations (and limitations thereon) of the Company under this
paragraph shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise
have and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors,
assigns, heirs and personal representatives of each Related Person. The
Company also agrees that neither the Purchasers nor any other Related Person
shall have any liability to the Company or any Person asserting claims on
behalf of or in right of the Company in connection with or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except to the extent,
but only to the extent, that any covenant or warranty owing to the Company is
breached by the applicable Purchaser or any Losses incurred by the Company
result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable
Purchaser or Related Person in connection with such transaction. If the
Company breaches its obligations under any Transaction Document, then, in
addition to any other liabilities the Company may have under any Transaction
Document or applicable law, the Company shall pay or reimburse the Purchasers
on demand for all costs of collection and enforcement (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company specifically agrees to reimburse the Purchasers on
demand for all costs of enforcing the indemnification obligations in this
paragraph.

Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission a &#147;Shelf&#148;
Registration Statement covering the resale of all Registrable Securities for
an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule&nbsp;415. The

accordance herewith as the Purchasers may consent) and shall contain (except
if otherwise directed by the Purchasers) the &#147;Plan of Distribution&#148; attached
hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;C</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as

Statement have been sold or can be sold publicly under Rule 144(k) by Persons
who are not Affiliates of the Company (the <B>&#147;Effectiveness Period"</B>).

monthly anniversary thereof until the applicable Event is cured, as partial
relief for the damages suffered therefrom by the Purchasers (which remedy
shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available under this Agreement,
at law or in equity), the Company shall pay to each Purchaser an amount in
cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1% of the
aggregate purchase price paid by such Purchaser hereunder; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that Event Payments (as defined below) shall not be payable for more than one
Event occurring or existing at any one time, and the Company shall have no
liability to the Purchaser for any Event Payments upon the occurrence of any
Event, or thereafter, if such Event is caused by or results from any action
or inaction of any Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
each individual occurrence of an Event described in clauses (ii)&nbsp;or (iv)&nbsp;of
this Section&nbsp;6.1(d), the Company shall have no liability to any Purchaser for
the related Event Payments beyond the first monthly anniversary after such

Any Event Payments payable pursuant to the terms hereof shall apply on a

following the Required Effectiveness Date;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) after the Effective Date and during the Effectiveness Period, a
Purchaser is not permitted to sell Registrable Securities under the
Registration Statement (or a subsequent Registration Statement filed in
replacement thereof) other than during an Allowable Suspension Period for
any reason for five consecutive Trading Days or an aggregate of ten
Trading Days in any twelve month period;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) after the Effective Date and during the Effectiveness Period,
any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement are not

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) after the Effective Date and during the Effectiveness Period,
the Common Stock is not listed or quoted, or is suspended from trading,

evidencing any Securities to a Purchaser within five Trading Days after
delivery of such certificate is required pursuant to any Transaction

Company may, by written notice to the Purchasers, suspend sales under a
Registration Statement after the Effective Date thereof and/or require that
the Purchasers immediately cease the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant
thereto and/or defer the filing of any subsequent Registration Statement if
the Company is engaged in a material merger, acquisition or sale, or any
pending material financing, material corporate reorganization or other
material corporate transaction that is reasonably expected to cause a
restatement of the Company&#146;s financial statements, and the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, by appropriate resolutions, that, as a result of
such sales activity it would be materially detrimental to the Company (other
than relating solely to the price of the Common Stock). Upon receipt of such
notice, each Purchaser shall immediately discontinue any sales of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration until such Purchaser has received
copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus or until such Purchaser is
advised in writing by the Company that the then-current Prospectus may be
used and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that
are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. I n
no event, however, shall this right be exercised to suspend sales beyond the
period during which (in the good faith determination of the Company&#146;s Board
of Directors) the failure to require such suspension would be materially
detrimental to the Company. Furthermore, in no event may the Company
exercise its rights hereunder for a period of more than 10 consecutive
Trading Days or more than 45 Trading Days in any twelve month period (each,
an &#147;<B>Allowable Suspension Period</B>&#148;) and at least two Trading Days shall elapse
between Allowable Suspension Periods. Immediately after the end of any
suspension period under this <U>Section&nbsp;6.1(e)</U>, the Company shall take all
necessary actions (including filing any required supplemental prospectus) to
restore the effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement and the
ability of the Purchasers to publicly resell their Registrable Securities
pursuant to such effective Registration Statement.

Registration Statement, prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of
others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities.

of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment
of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof;
provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant
to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not

pay such fees and expenses; or (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall have failed
promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or

Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such
Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects
to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such

specified exclusions to indemnification), then each Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount

proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions,
statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a
material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied
by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties&#146; relative

contribution pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;6.4(d)</U> were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.4(d), no
Purchaser shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in
excess of the amount by which the proceeds actually received by such
Purchaser from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the
Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Purchaser has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in <U>Sections

Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until such Purchaser&#146;s

Registration Statement contemplated by <U>Section&nbsp;6.2(j)</U>, or until it is advised
in writing (the <B>&#147;Advice"</B>) by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement. The

that, for value received, <U>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</U> or its registered assigns (the
"<B>Holder</B>&#148;), is entitled to purchase from the Company up to a total of
<U>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</U>shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the &#147;<B>Common
Stock</B>&#148;), of the Company (each such share, a &#147;<B>Warrant Share</B>&#148; and all such
shares, the &#147;<B>Warrant Shares</B>&#148;) at an exercise price equal to $ <U>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</U> (as
adjusted from time to time as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;9</U>, the &#147;<B>Exercise
Price</B>&#148;), at any time and from time to time from and after the date hereof
through and including December <U>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</U>, 2009 (the &#147;<B>Expiration Date</B>&#148;), and subject
to the following terms and conditions. This Warrant (this &#147;<B>Warrant</B>&#148;) is one of
a series of similar warrants issued pursuant to that certain Securities
Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Company and
the Purchasers identified therein (the &#147;<B>Purchase Agreement</B>&#148;). All such
warrants are referred to herein, collectively, as the &#147;<B>Warrants</B>.&#148;

Warrant, capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Registration of Warrant</U>. The Company shall register this
Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the

The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise
hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes,
absent actual notice to the contrary.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Registration of Transfers</U>. The Company shall register the
transfer of any portion of this Warrant in the Warrant Register, upon surrender
of this Warrant, with the Form of Assignment attached hereto duly completed and
signed, to the Transfer Agent or to the Company at its address specified
herein. Upon any such registration or transfer, a new warrant to purchase
Common Stock, in substantially the form of this Warrant (any such new warrant,
a &#147;<B>New Warrant</B>&#148;), evidencing the portion of this Warrant so transferred shall
be issued to the transferee and a New Warrant evidencing the remaining portion
of this Warrant not so transferred, if any, shall be issued to the transferring
Holder. The acceptance of the New Warrant by the transferee thereof shall be
deemed the acceptance by such transferee of all of the rights and obligations
of a holder of a Warrant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Exercise and Duration of Warrant</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;This Warrant shall be exercisable by the registered Holder at any time
and from time to time on or after the date hereof to and including the
Expiration Date; provided, however, that the Expiration Date shall be extended
for each day (i)&nbsp;the Registration Statement is not effective, or (ii)&nbsp;the
Company fails to have a sufficient number of authorized but unissued and
otherwise unreserved shares of Common Stock available to issue Warrant Shares
upon exercise of this Warrant. At 6:30 P.M., New York City time on the
Expiration Date, the portion of this Warrant not exercised prior thereto shall
be and become void and of no value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;A Holder may exercise this Warrant by delivering to the Company (i)&nbsp;an
exercise notice, in the form attached hereto (the &#147;<B>Exercise Notice</B>&#148;),
appropriately completed and duly signed, and (ii)&nbsp;payment of the Exercise Price
for the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised
(which may take the form of a &#147;cashless exercise&#148; if so indicated in the
Exercise Notice and if a &#147;cashless exercise&#148; may occur at such time pursuant to
Section&nbsp;10 below), and the date such items are delivered to the Company (as
determined in accordance with the notice provisions hereof) is an &#147;<B>Exercise
Date</B>.&#148; The Holder shall not be required to deliver the original Warrant in
order to effect an exercise hereunder. Execution and delivery of the Exercise
Notice shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and
issuance of a New Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number
of Warrant Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Company shall (i)&nbsp;keep the Registration Statement continuously
effective until the Expiration Date (including such day), and (ii)&nbsp;have a
sufficient number of authorized but unissued and otherwise unreserved shares of
Common Stock available to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Delivery of Warrant Shares</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Upon exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall promptly (but in no
event later than three Trading Days after the Exercise Date) issue or cause to
be issued and cause to be delivered to or upon the written order of the Holder
and in such name or names as the Holder may designate, a certificate for the
Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, free of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">restrictive legends. If the Holder provides or previously provided the
necessary account information to the Company, the Company shall issue and
deliver such Warrant Shares in a balance account of the Holder with the
Depository Trust Company through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission
System. The Holder, or any Person so designated by the Holder to receive
Warrant Shares, shall be deemed to have become holder of record of such Warrant
Shares as of the Exercise Date. The Company shall, upon request of the Holder,
use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver Warrant Shares hereunder
electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation or another established
clearing corporation performing similar functions.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;This Warrant is exercisable, either in its entirety or, from time to
time, for a portion of the number of Warrant Shares. Upon surrender of this
Warrant following one or more partial exercises, the Company shall issue or
cause to be issued, at its expense, a New Warrant evidencing the right to
purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the
Company fails to deliver to the Holder a certificate representing Warrant
Shares by the third Trading Day after the date on which delivery of such
certificate is required by this Warrant, and if after such third Trading Day
the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of
Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant
Shares that the Holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a &#147;<B>Buy-In</B>&#148;),
then in the Holder&#146;s sole discretion, the Company shall within three Trading
Days after the Holder&#146;s request, either (i)&nbsp;pay cash to the Holder in an amount
equal to the Holder&#146;s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if
any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased less the Exercise Price (the
"<B>Buy-In Price</B>&#148;), at which point the Company&#146;s obligation to deliver such
certificate (and to issue such Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii)&nbsp;promptly
honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates
representing such Common Stock and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to
the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A)&nbsp;such number of
shares of Common Stock, times (B)&nbsp;the Closing Price on the date of the event
giving rise to the Company&#146;s obligation to deliver such certificate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The Company&#146;s obligations to issue and deliver Warrant Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective
of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or
consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment
against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or
any violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other Person,
and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such
obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of
Warrant Shares. Nothing herein shall limit the Holder&#146;s right to pursue any
other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including,
without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief
with respect to the Company&#146;s failure to timely deliver certificates
representing shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant as required
pursuant to the terms hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U>Charges, Taxes and Expenses</U>. Issuance and delivery of
certificates for shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
made without charge to the Holder for any

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">issue or transfer tax, withholding tax, transfer agent fee
or other incidental tax or expense in respect of the issuance of such
certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which
may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the registration of any
certificates for Warrant Shares or Warrants in a name other than that of the
Holder or an Affiliate thereof. The Holder shall be responsible for all other
tax liability that may arise as a result of holding or transferring this
Warrant or receiving Warrant Shares upon exercise hereof.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>Replacement of Warrant</U>. If this Warrant is mutilated, lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange
and substitution for and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and
substitution for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon receipt of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and
customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>Reservation of Warrant Shares</U>. The Company covenants that it
will at all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its
authorized but unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as
herein provided, the number of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and
deliverable upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive
rights or any other contingent purchase rights of persons other than the Holder
(taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of <U>Section&nbsp;9</U>). The
Company covenants that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall,
upon issuance and the payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance
with the terms hereof, be duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid
and nonassessable. The Company will take all such action as may be necessary
to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be issued as provided herein
without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements
of any securities exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Common
Stock may be listed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;<U>Certain Adjustments</U>. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant
Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from
time to time as set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;9</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Stock Dividends and Splits</U>. If the Company, at any time while
this Warrant is outstanding, (i)&nbsp;pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock or
otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable in
shares of Common Stock, (ii)&nbsp;subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into
a larger number of shares, or (iii)&nbsp;combines outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price
shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which
the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i)&nbsp;of
this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or
distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii)&nbsp;or (iii)&nbsp;of this
paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such
subdivision or combination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Pro Rata Distributions</U>. If the Company, at any time while this
Warrant is outstanding, distributes to holders of Common Stock (i)&nbsp;evidences of
its indebtedness, (ii)&nbsp;any


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">4

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">security (other than a distribution of Common Stock covered by
the preceding paragraph), (iii)&nbsp;rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any security, or (iv)&nbsp;any other asset (in each case, &#147;<B>Distributed Property</B>&#148;),
then in each such case the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the
record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
distribution (and the Exercise Price thereafter applicable) shall be adjusted
(effective on and after such record date) to equal the product of such Exercise
Price times a fraction of which the denominator shall be the average of the
Closing Prices for the five Trading Days immediately prior to (but not
including) such record date and of which the numerator shall be such average
less the then fair market value of the Distributed Property distributed in
respect of one outstanding share of Common Stock, as determined by the
Company&#146;s independent certified public accountants that regularly examine the
financial statements of the Company (an &#147;<B>Appraiser</B>&#148;). In such event, the
Holder, after receipt of the determination by the Appraiser, shall have the
right to select an additional appraiser (which shall be a nationally recognized
accounting firm), in which case such fair market value shall be deemed to equal
the average of the values determined by each of the Appraiser and such
appraiser. As an alternative to the foregoing adjustment to the Exercise Price,
at the request of the Holder delivered before the 90th day after such record
date, the Company will deliver to the Holder, within five Trading Days after
such request (or, if later, on the effective date of such distribution), the
Distributed Property that the Holder would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the Warrant Shares for which this Warrant could have been exercised
immediately prior to such record date. If such Distributed Property is not
delivered to a Holder pursuant to the preceding sentence, then upon expiration
of or any exercise of this Warrant that occurs after such record date, such
Holder shall remain entitled to receive, in addition to the Warrant Shares
otherwise issuable upon such exercise (if applicable), such Distributed
Property.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Fundamental Transactions</U>. If, at any time while this Warrant
is outstanding, (i)&nbsp;the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another Person, (ii)&nbsp;the Company effects any sale of all
or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions,
(iii)&nbsp;any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another
Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to
tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, or (iv)
the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory
share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into
or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a
"<B>Fundamental Transaction</B>&#148;), then the Holder shall have the right thereafter to
receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities,
cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence
of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such
Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then
issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the &#147;<B>Alternate Consideration</B>&#148;).
The aggregate Exercise Price for this Warrant will not be affected by any such
Fundamental Transaction, but the Company shall apportion such aggregate
Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner
reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate
Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the
securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then
the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it
receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental
Transaction. At the Holder&#146;s request, any successor to the Company or
surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a
new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the
Holder&#146;s right to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">purchase the Alternate Consideration for the aggregate Exercise Price upon
exercise thereof. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental
Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or
surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (c)&nbsp;and
insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly
adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental
Transaction.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;<U>Number of Warrant Shares</U>. Simultaneously with any adjustment
to the Exercise Price pursuant to paragraphs (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of this Section, the
number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment
the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the increased or decreased
number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;<U>Calculations</U>. All calculations under this <U>Section&nbsp;9</U>
shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as
applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time
shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company,
and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of
Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;<U>Notice of Adjustments</U>. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;9</U>, the Company at its expense will promptly
compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and
prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of
the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Shares or
other securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable),
describing the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in
detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request,
the Company will promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder
and to the Company&#146;s Transfer Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;<U>Notice of Corporate Events</U>. If the Company (i)&nbsp;declares a
dividend or any other distribution of cash, securities or other property in
respect of its Common Stock, including without limitation any granting of
rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary, (ii)&nbsp;authorizes or approves, enters into any
agreement contemplating or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental
Transaction or (iii)&nbsp;authorizes the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the affairs of the Company, then the Company shall deliver to the
Holder a notice describing the material terms and conditions of such
transaction, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or
effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common Stock in order to
participate in or vote with respect to such transaction, and the Company will
take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the Holder is given
the practical opportunity to exercise this Warrant prior to such time so as to
participate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided, however,
that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not affect
the validity of the corporate action required to be described in such notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<U>Payment of Exercise Price</U>. The Holder shall pay the Exercise
Price in immediately available funds; provided, however, if the Registration
Statement is not effective on the Exercise Date, the Holder may satisfy its
obligation to pay the Exercise Price through a

intended, understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a
cashless exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the
Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have
commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally issued pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;<U>Limitation on Exercise</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be
acquired by the Holder upon any exercise of this Warrant (or otherwise in
respect hereof) shall be limited to the extent necessary to insure that,
following such exercise (or other issuance), the total number of shares of
Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and any
other Persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated
with the Holder&#146;s for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, does not
exceed 4.999% (the &#147;<B>Maximum Percentage</B>&#148;) of the total number of issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock (including for such purpose the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such exercise). For such purposes, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Each delivery of an
Exercise Notice hereunder will constitute a representation by the Holder that
it has evaluated the limitation set forth in this paragraph and determined that
issuance of the full number of Warrant Shares requested in such Exercise Notice
is permitted under this paragraph. The Company&#146;s obligation to issue shares of
Common Stock in excess of the limitation referred to in this Section shall be
suspended (and shall not terminate or expire notwithstanding any contrary
provisions hereof) until such time, if any, as such shares of Common Stock may
be issued in compliance with such limitation. By written notice to the
Company, the Holder may waive the provisions of this Section or increase or
decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage specified in such
notice, but (i)&nbsp;any such waiver or increase will not be effective until the
61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii)&nbsp;any such
waiver or increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder and not to any
other holders of Warrants.

agent may be merged or any corporation resulting from any consolidation to
