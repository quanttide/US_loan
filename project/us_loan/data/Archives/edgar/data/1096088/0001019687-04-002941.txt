ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 23, 2004, we held our second closing pursuant to a
Subscription Agreement with Alpha Capital Aktiengesellschaft, Stonestreet
Limited Partnership, Ellis International Ltd., and Momona Capital Corp. (the
"Investors") dated October 28, 2004 pursuant to which the Investors purchased an
aggregate principal amount of $1,490,000 in 7% convertible promissory notes, and
100 Class A and Class B share purchase warrants for each 100 shares which would
be issued on each closing date assuming full conversion of the convertible notes
issued on each such closing date. The aforementioned securities were issued to
the Investors by us pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D as promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and/or Section 4(2) of the
Act.

         $596,000 of the purchase price was paid to us by the Investors on the
initial closing date of October 28, 2004 and $894,000 of the purchase price was
paid to us pursuant to the second closing on December 23, 2004.

         The convertible notes bear simple interest at 7% per annum payable upon
each conversion, January 1, 2005 and semi-annually thereafter and mature 3 years
after the date of issuance.

         Each Investor shall have the right to convert the convertible notes
after the date of issuance and at any time, until paid in full, at the election
of the Investor into fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock.
The conversion price per share shall be the lower of (i) $.074 or (ii) 80% of
the average of the three lowest closing bid prices for our common stock for the
30 trading days prior to, but not including, the conversion date as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P. on any principal market or exchange where our common stock is
listed or traded. The conversion price is adjustable in the event of any stock
split or reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification of common stock,
recapitalization, merger or consolidation. In addition, the conversion price of
the convertible notes will be adjusted in the event that we spin off or
otherwise divest ourselves of a material part of our business or operations or
dispose all or a portion of our assets.

         We issued Class A warrants to purchase an aggregate of 22,203,622
shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase an aggregate of
22,203,622 shares of common stock to the Investors, representing 100 Class A and
Class B warrants issued for each 100 shares which would be issued on the second
closing date assuming full conversion of the convertible notes issued on each
such closing date. The warrants are exercisable until five years from the second
closing date at an exercise price of $0.07 per share. The exercise price of the
warrants will be adjusted in the event of any stock split or reverse stock
split, stock dividend, reclassification of common stock, recapitalization,
merger or consolidation. In addition, the exercise price of the warrants will be
adjusted in the event that we spin off or otherwise divest ourselves of a
material part of our business or operations or dispose all or a portion of our
assets.
