Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

         On December 27, 2004, AmREIT acquired MacArthur Park Shopping Center, a
Kroger anchored shopping center consisting of 198,443 square feet located on
approximately 23 acres for $38 million. The property, which was acquired from
Regency Centers, is located in Dallas, Texas at the northwest intersection of
I-635 and MacArthur Boulevard in the heart of Las Colinas, an affluent
residential and business community that is home to Fortune 500 companies such as
ExxonMobil, Citigroup, and Sabre. The purchase price consists of
the assumption of $13.41 million in long term fixed rate debt with the remainder
to be paid in cash. The debt bears interest at 6.17% per annum and matures in
December 2008. The weighted average remaining lease term for the project is
eight years. The Kroger lease is for 20-years, containing approximately 63,000
square feet, expiring in November 2020. The shopping center is 100 percent
occupied. The 2005 net operating income contribution to AmREIT is expected to be
approximately $2.8 million in 2005.

         Following is a list of MacArthur Park Shopping Center's current
tenants:

On December 28, 2004 the Company issued a press release announcing, among other
things, this acquisition. A copy of that press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1
to this report on Form 8-K.

Item 2.06 Material Impairments

On December 22, 2004, the Company began marketing its Just For Feet project
located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The Company will record an impairment charge
to earnings of approximately $1.3 million in the fourth quarter to reflect the
anticipated loss to be incurred upon sale of the property, following the
bankruptcy of its sole tenant. After a thorough remarketing of the property
during the past 120 days, the Company could not replace the previously existing
value and determined to sell the asset and redeploy the remaining value into
more productive investments.

As previously announced, the Company intends to sell an additional $10-15
million of non-core assets and has begun the marketing process on these
properties. Based on management's evaluation of these properties, the local
markets and the remaining lease term, management does not anticipate any future
impairment issues on these properties.
