Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 20, 2004, all contingencies in AmREIT's contract to acquire
a grocery-anchored shopping center consisting of 198,443 square-feet located on
approximately 23 acres were satisfied, and the agreement became enforceable
against AmREIT. The property, which is expected to be acquired on December 23,
2004, is being purchased for $38.8 million and is located in the greater
Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas area. The property will be acquired through the
assumption of $13.4 million of long term fixed rate debt with the remainder of
the purchase price to be paid in cash. The weighted average remaining lease term
for the project is eight years. The shopping center is 100 percent occupied. The
annual net operating income contribution to AmREIT is expected to be
approximately $2.64 million.
