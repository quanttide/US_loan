<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ITEM 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) announced today that, on
December&nbsp;27, 2004, it received a $250,000 loan from Toucan Capital Fund II,
L.P. (&#147;Toucan&#148;). The loan accrues interest at 10% per year, matures on
December&nbsp;27, 2005, and the principal and interest is convertible into capital
stock of the Company, generally at Toucan&#146;s option, prior to repayment. The
principal and interest on the loan is currently convertible at $0.04 per share
(subject to adjustment). In connection with this new loan, the Company has
issued a warrant to Toucan, which is exercisable for up to 2.5&nbsp;million shares
of the Company&#146;s capital stock. The exercise price of the warrant is the
lesser of (i) $.10 per share (subject to certain adjustments); or (ii)&nbsp;a 35%
discount to the average closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock during the
twenty trading days prior to the first closing of the sale of convertible
preferred stock of the Company, but not less than $.04 per share. The Company
believes that the additional $250,000 received from Toucan on December&nbsp;27, 2004
will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements until January&nbsp;8, 2005.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To date, the Company has issued eight promissory notes to Toucan pursuant to
which Toucan has loaned the Company an aggregate of $4.35&nbsp;million. In
connection with the issuance of promissory notes to Toucan, the Company has
issued and Toucan has received warrants that are currently exercisable for an
aggregate of up to 98.5&nbsp;million shares of the Company&#146;s capital stock.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the recent loan from Toucan, the Company and Toucan agreed
to amend the Amended and Restated Recapitalization Agreement, dated as of July
30, 2004, amended on October&nbsp;22, 2004 and on November&nbsp;10, 2004, between the
parties (&#147;Amendment No.&nbsp;3&#148;). Amendment No.&nbsp;3 extends the bridge period which
previously expired on December&nbsp;17, 2004 through January&nbsp;8, 2005 and removes a
covenant to which the Company was previously subject. During the bridge period
the Company generally is prohibited from entering into discussions with any
third party regarding a sale of the Company, its assets or the issuance of its
securities.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Also in connection with the recent loan from Toucan, the Company and Toucan
agreed to amend the Amended and Restated Binding Term Sheet dated April&nbsp;26,
2004, and amended and restated on October&nbsp;26, 2004 between the parties (the
&#147;Term Sheet&#148;). The Term Sheet, as amended, reduced warrant coverage in the
potential private placement by $250,000 and removed a closing condition.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amended and Restated Recapitalization Agreement, as amended, contemplates a
proposed equity financing that would provide for the potential issuance and
sale of up to $40&nbsp;million of convertible preferred stock (including any shares
issuable upon conversion of bridge funding, but not including any shares
issuable upon exercise of warrants, options, and similar instruments or
obligations), in one or more closings over a period of 12&nbsp;months from the first
closing of the sale of convertible preferred stock. If issued, the convertible
preferred stock will be issued at a price per share equal to the lesser of
$0.10 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like) or a 35%
discount to the average closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock during the
twenty trading days prior to the first closing of the proposed equity
financing, but not less than $0.04 per share. The proposed equity financing is
contingent upon the Company complying with covenants in the Amended and
Restated Recapitalization Agreement, as amended, and locating investors who are
willing to invest in the Company on the terms proposed.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The foregoing description of Amendment No.&nbsp;3, the note, the warrant and the
Term Sheet, all of which are filed as exhibits to the Form&nbsp;8-K, are qualified
in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements.

      Period following the period covered by the November Bridge Funding. The
      December 27 Bridge Funding shall be evidenced by a Note in the form
      attached hereto as Exhibit A-8 and shall be provided on the terms and
      conditions set forth herein. The December 27 Bridge Funding shall be used
      only for the purposes and in the amounts agreed to in writing by Investor
      and the Company."

6. Section 2.3(b) of the Agreement is hereby further amended by replacing the
phrase "or if provided, November Bridge Funding" with "November Bridge Funding
or December 27 Bridge Funding" in the tenth sentence thereof (i.e., the
thirteenth sentence thereof after giving effect to the inclusion of the three
new sentences therein per Section 4 of this Amendment).

7. Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b) of the Agreement are hereby each amended by
replacing "two hundred thirty-five (235) (or in the event the November Bridge
Funding (as defined herein) is not provided, two hundred (200))" with "two
hundred fifty-seven (257)."

8. The Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new Section 2.13, immediately
following Section 2.12 thereof, as follows:

      "2.13 December 27 Bridge Warrant:

            (a) Issuance of December 27 Bridge Warrant. On the Third Amendment
      Date, Investor shall receive a warrant with coverage equal to one hundred
      percent (100%) of the principal amount due under the Note evidencing the
      December 27 Bridge Funding (the "DECEMBER 27 BRIDGE WARRANT"). The Company
      shall, therefore, issue $250,000 in warrant coverage on the $250,000 of
      December 27 Bridge Funding provided on the Third Amendment Date. The
      number of shares subject to the December 27 Bridge Warrant to be so issued
      shall be determined on the basis of $0.10 per share (subject to adjustment
      for stock splits, stock dividends and the like). The total number of
      shares for which Investor shall initially be able to exercise the December
      27 Bridge Warrant shall therefore be 2,500,000 shares as of the Third
      Amendment Date.

            (b) Exercise of December 27 Bridge Warrant. The December 27 Bridge
      Warrant shall be immediately exercisable upon issuance and continue to be
      exercisable for a period of seven (7) years after its issuance date. The
      exercise price of the

                                                               EXECUTION VERSION

      December 27 Bridge Warrant shall be the lesser of $0.10 per share (subject
      to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and the like, as provided
      more fully in the December 27 Bridge Warrant) and a 35% discount to the
      average closing price during the twenty trading days prior to the first
      closing of the sale of Convertible Preferred Stock; provided, however that
      in no event will the exercise price be less than $0.04 per share (subject
      to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and the like, as provided
      more fully in the December 27 Bridge Warrant). In the event the
      Convertible Preferred Stock is approved and authorized, and the terms and
      conditions are the same as set forth herein and in the Convertible
      Preferred Stock Term Sheet, and Other Investors have purchased in cash
      (and not by conversion of debt, exercise of warrants or options, or
      conversion or exercise of other securities or instruments) a minimum of
      $15 million of such Convertible Preferred Stock, on the terms and
      conditions set forth herein and in the Convertible Preferred Stock Term
      Sheet, then the December 27 Bridge Warrant shall be exercisable solely for
      such Convertible Preferred Stock (subject to Section 5 thereof). However,
      if, for any reason, such Convertible Preferred Stock is not approved or
      authorized, and/or is approved or authorized on any terms different than
      any terms set forth herein and in the Convertible Preferred Stock Term
      Sheet, and/or if Other Investors have not purchased in cash (and not by
      conversion of debt, exercise of warrants or options, or conversion or
      exercise of other securities or instruments) a minimum of $15 million of
      such Convertible Preferred Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth
      herein and in the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet, the December 27
      Bridge Warrant shall be exercisable for any Equity Security and/or Debt
      Security (each as defined in Section 2.7 hereof) and/or any combination
      thereof, in each case that Investor shall designate in Investor's sole
      discretion (the securities so elected being the "INVESTOR DESIGNATED
      SECURITIES").

            (c) No Impairment. The Company shall not, by amendment of its
      Charter or through a reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
      merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary
      action, omission, or agreement, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
      performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed by the Company
      under and/or in connection with the December 27 Bridge Warrant, but shall
      at all times in good faith use best efforts to assist in carrying out of
      all the provisions of and/or relating to such December 27 Bridge Warrant
      and in taking all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
      protect Investor's rights, preferences and privileges under and/or in
      connection with the December 27 Bridge Warrant against impairment.
      Investor's rights, preferences and privileges granted under and/or in
      connection with the December 27 Bridge Warrant may not be amended,
      modified or waived without Investor's prior written consent, and the
      documentation providing for such rights, preferences and privileges will
      specifically provide as such.

            (d) Tax Treatment of December 27 Bridge Warrant and Note. The
      Company and Investor, as a result of arm's length bargaining, agree that
      the fair market value of the Note to be issued in connection with the
      December 27 Bridge Funding, if issued apart from the December 27 Bridge
      Warrant, is $247,500, and the fair market value of the December 27 Bridge
      Warrant, if issued apart from such Note, is $2,500. The Company and
      Investor further agree that all tax filings and records relating to or
      including this Agreement, the Note to be issued in connection with the
      December 27

      Bridge Funding and/or the December 27 Bridge Warrant shall be prepared on
      the basis of, and consistently reflect, the agreed fair market values set
      forth in this Section 2.13(d), and the Company shall instruct its
      accountants and other tax-preparation professionals to prepare all tax

Funding is not provided, 75,000,000)" with "67,500,000" in the third sentence
thereof.

10. Section 4.7.15 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety as follows:

the Third Amendment Date shall be deemed to be a "NOTE" for all purposes under

$250,000.00                                                    DECEMBER 27, 2004

SECTION 1. GENERAL.

For value received, NORTHWEST BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Maker" or the "Company"), hereby promises to pay to the order of Toucan Capital
Fund II, L.P. or its assigns (collectively, the "Holder"), the principal amount
of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) upon written demand by Holder
made at any time on or after the first anniversary of execution of this Loan
Agreement, Security Agreement and 10% Convertible, Secured Promissory Note (this
"Note" or this "Agreement"), or such earlier date as may be applicable under
Sections 3 and 4 hereof (the "Maturity Date"). Maker shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of this Note, accruing from and after the date hereof at
the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, compounding annually (computed on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed) (the "Interest
Rate"). Accrued interest shall be payable upon the payment of the principal of
this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note shall be payable in
lawful currency of the United States of America by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the account of Holder, as provided in writing to Maker by
Holder. All payments shall be applied first to fees, costs and charges relating
to this Note (including, without limitation, any costs of collection), then to
accrued and unpaid interest, and thereafter to principal. This loan is made by
Holder to Maker in anticipation of an equity financing. Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Recapitalization Agreement.

SECTION 2. PRE-PAYMENT.

This Note may be pre-paid in whole or in part prior to the Maturity Date;
provided Maker provides Holder with 30 days prior written notice thereof, and
provided further that Holder shall have the option to convert this note in
accordance with Section 12 hereof by notifying Maker of Holder's election on or
before the expiration of such thirty (30) day notice period. In the event of
prepayment, Maker shall pay a penalty in the amount of 1% of the principal and
accrued interest then outstanding under this Note, unless a greater or lesser
penalty is established or approved by the U.S. Small Business Administration
("SBA"). Conversion of this Note shall not be deemed a prepayment.

SECTION 3. DEFAULT INTEREST.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined), the unpaid
principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest shall bear interest payable on
demand at the lesser of (i) fourteen percent (14%) per annum, (ii) the maximum
rate permitted under applicable rules and regulations of the SBA, or (iii) the
maximum rate allowed by law (the "Default Interest"). Such interest shall
accrue, commencing upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and continuing
until such Event of Default is cured or waived.

SECTION 4. DEFAULTS.

      4.1 Definitions. Each occurrence of any of the following events shall
constitute an "Event of Default":

            (a) if a default occurs in the payment of any principal of, interest
on, or other obligation with respect to, this Note, whether at the due date
thereof or upon acceleration thereof, and such default remains uncured for five
(5) business days after written notice thereof from Holder;

            (b) if any representation or warranty of Maker made herein shall
have been false or misleading in any material respect, or shall have contained
any material omission, as of the date hereof;

            (c) if a default occurs in the due observance or performance of any
covenant or agreement on the part of Maker to be observed or performed pursuant
to the terms of this Note and such default remains uncured for five (5) business
days after written notice thereof from Holder;

            (d) if a default occurs in Maker's performance of any of the terms
and conditions of that certain Amended and Restated Recapitalization Agreement,
dated as of July 30, 2004 and as amended on October 22, 2004, November 10, 2004
and December 27, 2004 (the "Recapitalization Agreement") or any Related
Recapitalization Document;

            (e) if Maker shall (i) discontinue its business, (ii) apply for or
consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator of
Maker or any of its property, (iii) make a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or (iv) file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or a petition or an
answer seeking reorganization or an arrangement with creditors, or take
advantage of any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, readjustment of debt,
dissolution or liquidation laws or statutes, or file an answer admitting the
material allegations of a petition filed against it in any proceeding under any
such law, provided, however, that insolvency of Maker shall not constitute a
default, or the basis for a default, during the Bridge Period;

            (f) if there shall be filed against Maker an involuntary petition
seeking reorganization of Maker or the appointment of a receiver, trustee,
custodian or liquidator of Maker or a substantial part of its assets, or an
involuntary petition under any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency law of
any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect (any of the foregoing
petitions being hereinafter referred to as an "Involuntary Petition") and such
Involuntary Petition shall not have been dismissed within ninety (90) days after
it was filed, provided, however, that insolvency of Maker shall not constitute a
default, or the basis for a default, during the Bridge Period;

            (g) if final judgment(s) for the payment of money in excess of an
aggregate of $25,000 (excluding any portion thereof that an insurance company of
nationally recognized

                                        2

                                                               EXECUTION VERSION

standing and creditworthiness has agreed to pay) shall be rendered against Maker
and the same shall remain undischarged for a period of thirty (30) days;

            (h) if there occurs any event that may have a material adverse
effect on the business, affairs, prospects, operations, properties, assets,
liabilities, structure or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company (as
such business is presently currently conducted and/or as it is proposed to be
conducted), or on any material assets or any Intellectual Property or other
Collateral developed, owned, controlled, licensed, possessed, or used by Maker,
or to which Maker has any right, option, entitlement or claim, provided,
however, that ongoing weakening of Maker's financial condition due to ongoing
expenditures and Maker's failure to obtain equity financing shall not constitute
a default, or the basis for a default, during the Bridge Period; or

            (i) if Maker deviates, during the period covered by such budget,
more than $10,000 in aggregate from the budget included in the Disclosure
Schedule (as defined herein), or takes any action or makes any promise,
undertaking or commitment that would result in Maker incurring or accumulating
payables and/or other financial obligations of any kind, whether current or
deferred, direct or indirect, for purposes other than as set forth in budgets
expressly agreed to by Holder, and/or in any amounts in excess of the amounts
set forth in such agreed budgets, which equal or exceed $10,000 in aggregate,
and which have not been approved in writing in advance by Holder.

      4.2 Cross-Default: Maker acknowledges that the financing contemplated by
this Note is part of an integrated Recapitalization Plan, as set forth in the
Recapitalization Agreement and the Related Recapitalization Documents. Maker
further acknowledges and agrees that this Note is subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in the Recapitalization Agreement and the Related
Recapitalization Documents, and that the Recapitalization Agreement and the
Related Recapitalization Documents are subject to all of the terms and
conditions of this Note. Maker agrees that any default by Maker under any
provision of this Note, the Recapitalization Agreement or any of the Related
Recapitalization Documents will constitute a default under each other Related
Recapitalization Document and the Recapitalization Agreement.

      4.3 Remedies on Default.

            (a) Upon each and every such Event of Default and at any time
thereafter during the continuance of such Event of Default: (i) any and all
indebtedness of Maker to Holder under this Note or otherwise shall immediately
become due and payable, both as to principal and interest (including any
deferred interest and any accrued and unpaid interest and any Default Interest);
and (ii) Holder may exercise all the rights of a creditor under applicable state
and/or federal law.

      (b) In case any one or more Events of Default shall occur and be
continuing, and acceleration of this Note or any other indebtedness of Maker to
Holder shall have occurred, Holder may, inter alia, proceed to protect and
enforce its rights by an action at law, suit in equity and/or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained in
this Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof
or thereof or in furtherance of the exercise of any power granted hereby or
thereby or by law. No

right conferred upon Holder by this Note shall be exclusive of any other right
referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity,
by statute or otherwise.

SECTION 5. DEFENSES.

      5.1 No Offsets. The obligations of Maker under this Note shall not be
subject to reduction, limitation, impairment, termination, defense, set-off,
counterclaim or recoupment for any reason.

      5.2 Usury Limitations. It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply
with all applicable usury laws; accordingly, it is agreed that notwithstanding
any provisions to the contrary in this Note or any other agreements or
instruments between them, in no event shall such agreements or instruments
require the payment or permit the collection of interest (which term, for
purposes hereof, shall include any amount which, under applicable law, is deemed

or hereafter construed by the courts having jurisdiction thereof.

      9.2 Actions of Holder not a Waiver. No delay by Holder in exercising any

SECTION 10. COVENANTS.

            (a) Office. Maker shall maintain its principal office, and the
majority of its employees, assets and operations, in the United States.

            (b) Use of Proceeds. Maker will use the proceeds from this Note only
for the following purposes:

      (i) General operating expenses, expenses for the development and
      protection of its intellectual property, and other usual and customary
      commercial and business expenses incurred in pursuing its business plan
      and strategy, on and after the effective date hereof;

      (ii) Audit expenses and regular and special SEC filing expenses, for
      audits and filings occurring on or after the effective date hereof,
      including, without limitation, SEC filings relating to solicitation of any

      (iii) Expenses of accountants, attorneys, consultants and other
      professionals (including, without limitation, the expenses of Investor
      described in Section 4.11 of the Recapitalization Agreement) relating to
      the recapitalization of Maker,

in each case only to the extent that both the nature and the amount of such
expenses are in conformity with the budget approved in advance in writing by
Holder and included in the Disclosure Schedule. Maker will not use the proceeds
from this Note for any other purpose. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, none of the proceeds will be used, without prior written agreement by
the Holder, (i) to purchase or carry (or refinance any borrowing, the proceeds
of which were used to purchase or carry) any "security" within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (ii) to repay any
indebtedness or discharge any obligation to an person or entity, other than
trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business on or after the
effective date hereof, and consistent with Maker's operating plans and budgets
fully disclosed to the Holder prior to the Closing, or (iii) to engage in
business activities which would cause a violation of 13 CFR 107.720. This latter
limitation prohibits, without limitation, the use of proceeds: (i) directly or
indirectly, for providing funds to others; (ii) for the purchase or discounting
of debt obligations; (iii) for factoring or long-term leasing of equipment with
no provision for maintenance or repair; (iv) for engaging in real estate
transactions such that Maker could reasonably be classified under Major Group 65
(Real Estate) of the SIC Manual; (v) for business activities wherein the assets
of the business of Maker (the "Business") will be reduced or consumed, generally
without replacement, as the life of the Business progresses, and the nature of
the Business does not require that a stream of cash payments be made to the
financing sources of the Business, on a basis associated with the continuing
sale of assets (examples of such businesses would include real estate
development projects, the financing and production of motion pictures, and oil
and gas well exploration, development and production); (vi) for a foreign
operation; (vii) to provide capital to a

corporation licensed or sub-licensed under the Small Business Investment Act,
(viii) to acquire farm land, (ix) to fund production of a single item or defined
limited number of items generally over a defined production period, such
production to constitute the majority, of the activities of Maker (examples
include electric generating plants), or (x) for any purpose contrary to the
public interest (including, but not limited to, activities which are in
violation of law) or inconsistent with free competitive enterprise, in each
case, within the meaning of Section 107.720 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.

            (c) Seniority. Except as otherwise expressly provided, and except
for security interests and liens described in items 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 14.11
of the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Disclosure
Schedule"), the indebtedness evidenced by this Note: (i) shall be senior in all
respects to all other indebtedness or obligations of Maker of any kind, direct
or indirect, contingent or otherwise, other than obligations of Maker owed
directly to the state or federal government, and other than any other
indebtedness or obligations of Maker to Holder; (ii) shall not be made
subordinate or subject in right of payment to the prior payment of any other
indebtedness or obligation of any kind, direct or indirect, contingent or
otherwise, other than obligations of Maker owed directly to the state or federal
government, and other than any other indebtedness or obligations of Maker to
Holder.

            (d) No Conflicting Agreements. Maker shall not enter into any
agreement that would materially impair, interfere or conflict with Maker's
obligations hereunder. Without Holder's prior written consent, Maker shall not
permit the inclusion in any material contract to which it becomes a party of any
provisions that could or might in any way result in the creation of a security
interest in any assets of Maker, including without limitation any Collateral (as
defined in Exhibit A hereto).

            (e) Disclosure of Material Adverse Events. Within three (3) business
days of Maker obtaining knowledge thereof, Maker will notify Holder in writing
of any event that may have a material adverse effect on the business, affairs,
prospects, operations, properties, assets, liabilities, structure or condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Company (as such business is presently conducted
and/or as it is proposed to be conducted), or on any material assets or any
Intellectual Property or other Collateral developed, owned, controlled,
licensed, possessed, or used by Maker, or to which Maker has any right, option,
entitlement or claim. Operating expenditures in the ordinary course of business
and in accordance with operating budgets approved by Maker's Board of Directors
and fully disclosed to Holder prior to the effective date hereof shall not be
deemed to be material adverse events solely because they weaken Maker's
financial condition in the absence of new equity financing of Maker.

            (f) Financial Information. So long as any principal and/or interest
under this Note shall remain outstanding:

                  (i) Promptly after the end of each fiscal year (but in any
      event prior to February 28 of each year) and at such other times as Holder
      may reasonably request, Maker shall deliver to Holder a written
      assessment, in form and substance satisfactory to Holder, of the economic
      impact of such Holder's financing hereunder, specifying the full-time
      equivalent jobs created or retained in connection with such investment,
      and the

      impact of the financing on Maker's business in terms of revenues and
      profits and on taxes paid by Maker and its employees.

                  (ii) Maker shall provide on a timely basis to Holder all
      financial information requested from time to time by Holder, including
      without limitation its quarterly and annual balance sheet and income
      statement. Such financial information shall be certified by a member of
      Maker's senior management. Financial information required shall also
      include such information as is necessary for Holder to file form 468 with
      the SBA.

                  (iii) In addition to the information specified in Section
      10.1(f)(i) and (ii) above, upon request, Maker agrees promptly to provide
      Holder with sufficient additional information to permit Holder to comply
      with (i) its obligations under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958,
      as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and related thereto
      and (ii) provide any other information reasonably requested or required by
      any governmental agency asserting jurisdiction over Holder.

                  (iv) Maker shall report its cash position and all expenditures
      and agreements, commitments or undertakings for expenditures to Holder on
      a bi-weekly basis.

            (g) Access. So long as any principal and/or interest under this Note
shall remain outstanding, Maker shall permit Holder and its agents or
representatives to visit and inspect Maker's properties, to examine its books of
account and records and to discuss Maker's affairs, finances and accounts with
its officers, all at such times during normal business hours as reasonably may
be requested by Holder. Maker shall allow SBA Examiners access to its books and
records, as reasonably required by such Examiners in connection with their
annual audits of Holder or for any other legitimate purposes.

            (h) SBA Compliance. Maker acknowledges that Holder is a licensed
Small Business Investment Corporation and thereby a participant in the SBIC
program of the U. S. Small Business Administration ("SBA"), and as such is
subject to the rules, regulations, guidance and direction of the SBA on matters
affecting its business and investment practices, and that such rules and
regulations affect the business activities and practices of the companies in
which Holder makes investments. Maker shall promptly and fully cooperate with
Holder to facilitate both Maker's and Holder's compliance with all such SBA
rules, regulations, guidance and direction.

            (i) Business Activity. As long as this Note shall remain
outstanding, Maker shall make no change in its business activity that would make
it or any of its business activities non-compliant with SBA regulations and
guidelines.

contingent or otherwise, in, to or upon any assets of Maker, including, without
limitation, any intellectual property of any kind, as defined in Exhibit A
hereto (respectively, the "Intellectual Property" and the "Collateral").

            (c) Sale or License of Assets. Maker shall not sell, lease,
transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of or encumber (including, without
limitation through licensing or partnering arrangements) or abandon, conceal,
injure or destroy any material assets (whether tangible or intangible) of Maker
(including, without limitation, any Collateral (as defined in Section 11), other

undertakings, agreements or letters of intent for any of the issuances described

engage or retain, any Personnel, except with Holder's express prior written
approval, on a case by case basis.

            (g) Severance. Maker shall not enter into, increase, expand, extend,
renew or reinstate any severance, separation, retention, change of control or
similar agreement with any Personnel, or agree, promise, commit or undertake to
do so, except with Holder's prior written approval, on a case by case basis.

            (h) Facilities. Maker shall not purchase, lease, hire, rent or
otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any rights in or to any asset or
facility outside of the ordinary course of business in an amount in excess of

            (j) Other Limitations.

in a manner that would cause a violation of 13 C.F.R. Section 107.720 and/or
Section 107.760(b) (including, without limitation, by undertaking real estate,
film production or oil and gas exploration activities). In the event that Maker

any securities then held by Holder.

                  (ii) Maker will at all times comply with the

license, loan or otherwise in any way transfer or distribute Maker's Tangential
Flow Filtration ("TFF") devices or any similar device, or any specifications,
diagrams, description or other information about the TFF devices, to any third
party, or commit or promise or enter into any understanding of any kind, direct

SECTION 11. SECURITY INTEREST.

      11.1 First Priority in All Collateral. To secure its obligations under
this Note whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, Maker hereby
grants and pledges to Holder a first priority senior security interest in all of
Maker's right, title and interest in, to and under all of Maker's tangible and
intangible property, whether now owned, licensed or held or hereafter acquired,
licensed, developed, held or arising, as described in Exhibit A hereto (the
"Collateral"), and all proceeds of any kind from any disposition of any such
Collateral. Such security interest shall be senior to any security interest in
the Collateral granted the holders of the Management Notes pursuant to any
subordination agreement between Holder, the holders of the Management Notes and
Maker, and shall be senior to any other security interest of any kind, direct or
indirect, contingent or otherwise, in the Collateral except for the security
interests and liens described in items 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 14.11 of the
Disclosure Schedule (only to the amounts set forth on such schedule) and any
other indebtedness or obligations of Maker to Holder. If certificates of title
are now, or hereafter become, issued or outstanding with respect to any of the
Collateral, Maker promptly shall cause the senior security interest of Holder to
be properly noted thereon. Maker agrees that the security interest herein
granted has attached and shall continue until Maker's obligations under this
Note have been paid, performed and indefeasibly discharged in full.

      11.2 Rights Cumulative. The rights and remedies of Holder with respect to
the senior security interest granted hereby are in addition to those which are
now or may hereafter be available to Holder as a matter of law or equity. Each
right, power and remedy of Holder provided for herein, or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity, shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in
addition to every right, power and remedy provided for herein, and the exercise
by Holder of any one or more of the rights, powers and/or remedies provided for
in this Note, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity, shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by any person, including a grantee,
of any or all other rights, powers and/or remedies.

      11.3 Documentation of Security Interest. Maker shall execute, deliver,
file, amend, and re-file any financing statements, instruments (including
without limitation stock certificates), continuation statements, assignments, or
other security agreements that Holder may require from time to time to confirm
the liens arising out of this Note with respect to the Collateral. Maker agrees
to pay all reasonable costs associated with filing and/or re-filing of any
financing statements, continuation statements or other security agreements
required to perfect and to continue perfection of Holder's security interest in
the Collateral and all reasonable costs required to evidence the first priority
of the security interest, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees. Maker authorizes Holder to file financing statements under the UCC with
respect to the security interest granted hereby and agrees, upon request of
Holder, to promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further
instruments and documents, and to take such further action, as Holder may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to obtain the full benefits of this grant
of security interest.

      11.4 No Conflicting Agreements. Maker shall not enter into any agreement
on or after the effective date of this Note that would materially impair or
conflict with Maker's obligations hereunder without Holder's prior written
consent. Without Holder's prior written consent, Maker

                                       11

shall not permit the inclusion in any material contract to which it becomes a
party on or after the effective date of this Note, of any provisions that could
or might in any way prevent the creation, perfection and maintenance of a first
priority security interest in Maker's rights and interest in any property
included within the definition of the Collateral acquired under such contracts.
Maker represents and warrants that, as of the effective date of this Note, there
are no existing agreements or undertakings that would materially impair or
conflict with Maker's obligations hereunder or that could or might in any way
prevent the creation, perfection and maintenance of a first priority security
interest in Maker's rights and interest in any property included within the
definition of the Collateral acquired under such contracts; except for existing
equipment leases described in item 2 of Schedule 14.11 and the statutory liens
described in items 3 and 4 of the Disclosure Schedule.

      11.5 Notification Requirements. Within two (2) business days of any
officer, director or employee of Maker obtaining knowledge thereof, Maker will
promptly notify Holder in writing of any event that materially adversely affects
the value of any material Collateral, the ability of Maker to dispose of any
material Collateral, or the rights and remedies of Holder in relation thereto,
including the levy of any legal process against any of the Collateral.

      11.6 Foreclosure Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
or in the Recapitalization Agreement or any other agreement or document, in the
event that Maker is unable to pay and discharge this Note in full on the
Maturity Date, subject to the compliance with the requirements of the Delaware
Uniform Commercial Code, nothing herein or in the Recapitalization Agreement or
any other agreement or document shall be deemed to preclude, limit or restrict
Holder from requiring the delivery of some or all of the Collateral in full or
partial satisfaction of Maker's obligation under the Note. Alternatively, Holder
may, in its sole discretion, elect to cause some or all of the Collateral to be
sold, and the sale proceeds to be used to pay and discharge the Note in full.

SECTION 12. CONVERSION.

      12.1 Holder's Election. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note
or any applicable agreement or document, until, and/or in the absence of,
purchases for cash of a minimum of $15 million of Convertible Preferred Stock,
by Other Investors (as defined in the Recapitalization Agreement), on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Recapitalization Agreement and the Convertible
Preferred Stock Term Sheet, Holder may, in its sole discretion, elect to convert
any or all of the principal and/or interest due under the Note into any Equity
Security and/or Debt Security (each as defined below) and/or any combination
thereof, in each case that Holder shall designate in Holder's sole discretion
(the securities so elected being the "Holder Designated Securities"). Holder may
make such determinations from time to time and at any time before this Note has
been discharged in full, and, as applicable, at any time on or before the
expiration of the thirty (30) day notice period required under this Note in the
event the Maker wishes to prepay this Note. For purposes hereof, (i) the term
"Equity Security" means any class or series of equity security, or any
combination of classes and/or series of equity securities, of the Maker that
have been authorized under the Maker's certificate of incorporation, as amended
and/or restated, including by any certificate of designation (the "Charter"), or

new class or series of equity security, or any combination of new and/or

undertaking, commitment, agreement or letter of intent of the Maker, whether or

conversion or any issuance of the security or other instrument to that investor
or are provided separately, at any time on or after one year prior to the

dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action,
omission or agreement, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of

SECTION 14. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

Except as expressly set forth (with reference to a section in this Note) in the
Disclosure Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B (as updated as of each closing
contemplated by the Recapitalization Agreement and the Related Recapitalization
Documents), and only to the extent such exceptions are acceptable to Holder in
its sole discretion as of the date of this Note, and independently as of the
date upon which each additional Note is issued to Holder, and as of the date of
each closing, if any, of the Anticipated Equity Financing, Maker represents and
warrants to the following:

      14.1 Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Maker is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on its business. Maker is duly qualified to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure so to qualify would have a
material adverse effect on its business, properties, operations, prospects or
condition (financial or otherwise).

      14.2 Authorization of Note, Etc. The execution, delivery and performance
by Maker of this Note has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
by Maker in accordance with Delaware law. This Note is a valid and binding
obligation of Maker, enforceable against Maker in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, or other laws of general application effecting enforcements of
creditors' rights or general principles of equity.

      14.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery, performance, issuance, sale
and delivery of this Note and the Related Recapitalization Documents, and
compliance with the provisions hereof by Maker, will not (a) to the knowledge of
Maker, violate any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to Maker or any ruling, writ, injunction, order, judgment or decree of any
court, arbitrator, administrative agency or other governmental body applicable
to

                                       15

Maker or any of its properties or assets or (b) conflict with or result in any
material breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute
(with notice or lapse of time or both) a material default (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, or result in the
creation of, any encumbrance upon any of the material assets of Maker under, the
Charter or Bylaws of Maker (as they may be amended to date) or any agreement or
instrument to which Maker is a party. As used herein, "encumbrance" shall mean
any liens, charges, encumbrances, equities, claims, options, proxies, pledges,
security interests, licenses or other similar rights of any nature.

      14.4 Compliance with Other Instruments. Maker is not in violation of any

in violation of any term of any mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement,
instrument, judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or regulation to which Maker
or any of such Collateral is subject. To the best of Maker's knowledge, no event
has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both,
would constitute a breach or violation, in any material respect, under any
applicable judgments, orders, writs, decrees, federal, state and/or local laws,
rules or regulations which would have a material adverse affect on the
condition, financial or otherwise, or operations of Maker (as it is currently
conducted and as it is proposed to be conducted) or on any material assets or
any Intellectual Property or other Collateral owned, controlled, licensed,
possessed, and/or used by Maker. To the best of its knowledge, Maker has avoided
every condition, and has not performed any act, the occurrence of which would
result in Maker's loss of any right granted under any license, distribution
agreement or other agreement or Maker's loss of any rights in or to any
Collateral.

      14.5 Approvals. Maker has obtained all necessary permits, authorizations,
waivers, consents and approvals of or by, and made all necessary notifications
of and/or filings with, all applicable persons (governmental and private), in
connection with the execution, delivery, performance, issuance, sale and/or
delivery of this Note, the Recapitalization Agreement and the Related
Recapitalization Documents, and consummation by Maker of the transactions

agreement, promise, commitment, undertaking or letter of intent of any kind
(direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise) by Maker to issue any shares,
subscriptions, warrants, options, convertible securities, or other such rights,
or to distribute to holders of any of its equity securities any evidence of
indebtedness or asset. Except as set forth in Schedule 14.6, Maker has no
obligation of any kind

acquire any of its equity securities or any interest therein or to pay any
dividend or make any other distribution in respect thereof. Schedule 14.6
includes a true, accurate and complete statement describing the total number of
shares of Maker outstanding as of the date of this Note (on a fully diluted
basis, including, without limitation, all warrants and options outstanding
(whether or not currently exercisable), all convertible instruments of any kind
(whether or not currently convertible), shares of all classes of stock, and any
agreements, promises, commitments, undertakings or letters of intent to issue
any of the foregoing.

      14.7 Authorization of the Shares. Maker has, or before the first closing
of the Anticipated Equity Financing hereunder will have, authorized the issuance
and sale of a sufficient number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, par
value $0.001 per share, and Common Stock of the Maker to fully implement the
Recapitalization Plan, while maintaining such additional authorized but unissued
shares as reasonably determined by Holder to be appropriate. Of such authorized
shares, a sufficient number of shares shall be reserved for issuance upon any
exercise of the Bridge Warrants and/or Preferred Stock Warrants. If at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Convertible Preferred Stock
and/or of Common Stock is not sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding convertible Notes and other instruments, and the exercise of all
then outstanding warrants, options and similar instruments, then, in addition to
such other remedies as may be available to Holder, including, without
limitation, the exercise of Holder's right of first refusal set forth in Section
2.7(f) of the Recapitalization Agreement, Maker shall take such corporate action
as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock to such number of shares as will
be sufficient for such purposes. Such corporate action shall include, without
limitation, obtaining all requisite regulatory approvals and any requisite
shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to Maker's Charter.

      14.8 Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 14.8 of the Disclosure
Schedule, there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
the knowledge of Maker, currently threatened against Maker, and/or its
directors, officers, advisers, agents, properties, assets or business, in each
case relating to Maker and/or its business, assets, operations or properties.
Maker is not a party or subject to the provisions of any order, writ,
injunction, judgment or decree of any court or government agency or
instrumentality. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation by Maker
currently pending or which Maker intends to initiate.

      14.9 No Liens. Except for liens for the benefit of Holder, created by this
Note, the Recapitalization Agreement and/or any of the Related Recapitalization
Documents, and except as set forth in Schedule 14.9 of the Disclosure Schedule,
none of the material assets of Maker, including the Collateral, are subject to
any existing lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance of any kind,
direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise.

      14.10 Full Disclosure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note,
neither this Note, nor any exhibit hereto, nor any written report, certificate,
instrument or other information furnished to Holder in connection with the
transactions contemplated under and/or in connection with Note contain any

at such other address as it may designate by notice in writing to the Holder):

            (a) An executed Notice of Exercise in the form attached hereto;

            (b) Payment of the Exercise Price either (i) in cash or by check, or
(ii) by cancellation of indebtedness; and

            (c) This Warrant.

      Upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, a certificate
or certificates for the Exercise Shares so purchased, registered in the name of
the Holder or persons affiliated with the Holder, if the Holder so designates,
shall be issued and delivered to the Holder within a reasonable time after the
rights represented by this Warrant shall have been so exercised. In the event
that this Warrant is being exercised for less than all of the then-current
number of Exercise Shares purchasable hereunder, the Company shall, concurrently
with the issuance by the Company of the number of Exercise Shares for which this

the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being
canceled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company
together with the properly endorsed Notice of Exercise in which event the
Company shall issue to the Holder a number of Exercise Shares computed using the
following formula:

                     X = Y (A-B)
                         -------
                            A

      Where X = the number of Exercise Shares to be issued to the Holder

                                       2.

                                                               EXECUTION VERSION

            Y = the number of Exercise Shares purchasable under the Warrant or,
                if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, that
                portion of the Warrant being canceled (at the date of such
                calculation)

            A = the fair market value of one Exercise Share (at the date of such
                calculation)

            B = Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation)

      For purposes of the above calculation, the fair market value of one
Exercise Share shall be determined by the Company's Board of Directors in good
faith; provided, however, that in the event that this Warrant is exercised
pursuant to this Section 2.1 in connection with the Company's initial public
offering of its Common Stock, the fair market value per share shall be the
product of (i) the per share offering price to the public of the Company's
initial public offering, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock into
which each Exercise Share is convertible at the time of such exercise.

      2.2 SECURITIES FOR WHICH WARRANT IS EXERCISABLE. In the event the
Convertible Preferred Stock is approved and authorized, and the terms and
conditions are the same as set forth in the Recapitalization Agreement and in
the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet, and Other Investors have purchased
in cash (and not by conversion of debt, exercise of warrants or options, or
conversion or exercise of other securities or instruments) a minimum of $15
million of such Convertible Preferred Stock, on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Recapitalization Agreement and in the Convertible Preferred Stock
Term Sheet, then, subject to Section 5 hereof, this Warrant shall be exercisable
solely for such Convertible Preferred Stock. However, if, for any reason, such
Convertible Preferred Stock is not approved or authorized, and/or is approved or
authorized on any terms different than any terms set forth in the
Recapitalization Agreement and in the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet,
and/or if Other Investors have not purchased in cash (and not by conversion of
debt, exercise of warrants or options, or conversion or exercise of other
securities or instruments) a minimum of $15 million of such Convertible
Preferred Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Recapitalization
Agreement and in the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet, this Warrant shall
be exercisable for any Equity Security and/or Debt Security and/or any
combination thereof, in each case that Holder shall designate in Holder's sole
discretion.

      3. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.

            3.1 COVENANTS AS TO EXERCISE SHARES. The Company covenants and
agrees that all Exercise Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the
rights represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and free from all taxes, liens and
charges with respect to the issuance thereof. The Company further covenants and
agrees that the Company will at all times during the Exercise Period, have
authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, a sufficient number of
shares of the series of equity securities comprising the Exercise Shares and the
Company's Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by
this Warrant and the subsequent conversion of the Exercise Shares. If at any
time during the Exercise Period the number of authorized but unissued shares of
such series of the Company's equity securities or the Company's Common

                                       3.

                                                               EXECUTION VERSION

Stock shall not be sufficient to permit exercise of this Warrant or the
subsequent conversion of the Exercise Shares, then, in addition to such other
remedies as may be available to Holder, including, without limitation, the
exercise of Holder's right of first refusal set forth in Section 2.7(f) of the
Recapitalization Agreement, the Company will take such corporate action as shall
be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of such series of
the Company's equity securities or the Company's Common Stock, as appropriate,
to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

            3.2 NOTICES OF RECORD DATE. In the event of any taking by the
Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or
other distribution, the Company shall mail to the Holder, at least ten (10) days
prior to the date specified herein, a notice specifying the date on which any
such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.

            3.3 NO IMPAIRMENT. The Company shall not, by amendment of its
Charter or through a reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action,
omission or agreement, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed by the Company under and/or in
connection with this Warrant, but shall at all times in good faith use best
efforts to assist in carrying out of all the provisions of and/or relating to
this Warrant and in taking all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
protect Holder's rights, preferences and privileges under and/or in connection
with this Warrant against impairment. The Holder's rights, preferences and
privileges granted under and/or in connection with this Warrant may not be
amended, modified or waived without the Holder's prior written consent, and the
documentation providing for such rights, preferences and privileges will
specifically provide as such.

            3.4 REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The Company agrees that the Underlying
Shares (as defined below) shall be "registrable securities" (or terms of similar
impact) under any agreement executed by the Company as part of the Anticipated
Equity Financing, or any other agreement executed by the Company in lieu of,
and/or in addition to, the Anticipated Equity Financing, in each case, for
purposes of providing registration rights under the Act to holders of shares of
Capital Stock, and the Company shall ensure that any such agreement conforms
with the requirements of this Section 3.4. Such registration rights may not be
amended, modified or waived without the prior written consent of the Holder.

      4. REPRESENTATIONS OF HOLDER.

            4.1 ACQUISITION OF WARRANT FOR PERSONAL ACCOUNT. The Holder
represents and warrants that it is acquiring the Warrant, the Exercise Shares
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Exercise Shares
(the "UNDERLYING SHARES") solely for its account for investment and not with a
view to or for sale or distribution of said Warrant, Exercise Shares or
Underlying Shares, or any part thereof except in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities laws. The Holder also represents that the entire
legal and beneficial interests of the Warrant, the Exercise Shares and the
Underlying Shares the Holder is acquiring is being acquired for, and will be
held for, its account only.

                                       4.

                                                               EXECUTION VERSION

            4.2 SECURITIES ARE NOT REGISTERED.

                  (a) The Holder understands that the Warrant, the Exercise
Shares and the Underlying Shares have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT") on the basis that no distribution or public
offering of the stock of the Company is to be effected by the Holder. The Holder
realizes that the basis for the exemption may not be present if, notwithstanding
its representations, the Holder has a present intention of acquiring the
securities for a fixed or determinable period in the future, selling (in
connection with a distribution or otherwise), granting any participation in, or
otherwise distributing the securities. The Holder has no such present intention.

                  (b) The Holder recognizes that the Warrant, the Exercise
Shares and the Underlying Shares must be held indefinitely unless they are
subsequently registered under the Act or an exemption from such registration is
available; provided, however, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Company
has an obligation to register the Underlying Shares as provided in the
Recapitalization Agreement and the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet.

                  (c) The Holder is aware that neither the Warrant, the Exercise
Shares nor the Underlying Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 adopted under
the Act unless certain conditions are met, including, among other things, the
existence of a public market for the shares, the availability of certain current
public information about the Company, the resale following the required holding
period under Rule 144 and the number of shares being sold during any three month
period not exceeding specified limitations.

            4.3 DISPOSITION OF WARRANT, EXERCISE SHARES AND UNDERLYING SHARES.

                  (a) The Holder further agrees not to make any disposition of
all or any part of the Warrant, the Exercise Shares or the Underlying Shares in
any event unless and until:

                        (i) The Company shall have received a letter secured by
the Holder from the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that no action
will be recommended to the Commission with respect to the proposed disposition;

                        (ii) There is then in effect a registration statement
under the Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in
accordance with said registration statement; or

                        (iii) The Holder shall have notified the Company of the
proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed
statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and such
disposition shall not be contrary to any applicable federal and/or state
securities laws.

                  (b) The Holder understands and agrees that all certificates
evidencing the shares to be issued to the Holder may bear the following legend:

      THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
      1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE,
      PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE

      ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER
      THE ACT OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE
      FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

            4.4 ACCREDITED INVESTOR STATUS. The Holder is an "accredited
investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Act.

      5. ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE AND EXERCISE SHARES.

            5.1 CHANGES IN SECURITIES. In the event of changes in the series of
equity securities of the Company comprising the Exercise Shares by reason of
stock dividends, splits, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations or
exchanges of shares, separations, reorganizations, liquidations, or the like,
the number and class of Exercise Shares available under the Warrant in the
aggregate and the Exercise Price shall be correspondingly adjusted to give the
Holder of the Warrant, on exercise for the same aggregate Exercise Price, the
total number, class, and kind of shares as the Holder would have owned had the
Warrant been exercised prior to the event and had the Holder continued to hold
such shares until after the event requiring adjustment. For purposes of this
Section 5, the "AGGREGATE EXERCISE PRICE" shall mean the aggregate Exercise
Price payable in connection with the exercise in full of this Warrant. The form
of this Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment in the number of
Exercise Shares subject to this Warrant.

            5.2 AUTOMATIC CONVERSION. Upon the automatic conversion of all
outstanding shares of the series of equity securities comprising the Exercise
Shares into Common Stock, if applicable, this Warrant shall become exercisable
for that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which the Exercise
Shares would then be convertible, so long as such shares, if this Warrant had
been exercised prior to such offering, would have been converted into shares of
the Company's Common Stock pursuant to the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation. In such case, all references to "Exercise Shares" shall mean
shares of the Company's Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, as
appropriate.

            5.3 DILUTIVE ISSUANCES. If at any time prior to exercise of this
Warrant, the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold,
additional shares of Capital Stock for a nominal or effective price less than
the then effective Exercise Price (a "DILUTIVE ISSUANCE"), then and in each such
case, the then existing Exercise Price shall be reduced, as of the opening of
business on the date of such issue or sale, to the price at which such shares
are issued or sold, or deemed to be issued or sold. For purposes of this Section
5.3, the Company will be deemed to have issued or sold additional shares of
Capital Stock if it issues any security or instrument convertible, exercisable
or exchangeable for Capital Stock, or if it promises, undertakes, commits,
agrees or enters into any letter of intent to do so. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made as a
result of the actual issuance of shares of Capital Stock upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange of any such instrument or in satisfaction of any such
undertaking, commitment, agreement or letter of intent, and (ii) no adjustment
of the Exercise Price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of any
shares of Common Stock pursuant to either (X) the exercise of those certain
options to purchase up to 35,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of
$0.0001 per share that were

outstanding on April 26, 2004 and held by members of the Board of Directors of
the Company; or (Y) the exercise of the Initial Bridge Warrants.

            5.4 CERTIFICATE OF ADJUSTMENTS. Upon each adjustment of the Exercise
Price and/or Exercise Shares, the Company shall promptly notify the Holder in
writing and furnish the Holder with a certificate of its Chief Financial Officer
setting forth such adjustment and the facts upon which such adjustment is based.

      6. FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
exercise of this Warrant as a consequence of any adjustment pursuant hereto. All
Exercise Shares (including fractions) to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the exercise would
result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after aggregation, the
exercise would result in the issuance of a fractional share, the Company shall,
in lieu of issuance of any fractional share, pay the Holder otherwise entitled
to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the product resulting from multiplying
the then current fair market value of one Exercise Share by such fraction.

      7. TRANSFER OF WARRANT. Subject to applicable laws, this Warrant and all
rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, at any time or times by
the Holder, upon delivery of this Warrant and the form of assignment attached
hereto to any transferee designated by Holder. The transferee shall sign a
customary investment letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

      8. LOST, STOLEN, MUTILATED OR DESTROYED WARRANT. If this Warrant is lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Company may, on such terms as to indemnity
or otherwise as it may reasonably impose (which shall, in the case of a
mutilated Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like
denomination and tenor as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed.
Any such new Warrant shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the
Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
Warrant shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.

      9. AMENDMENT. Any term of this Warrant may be amended or waived only with
the written consent of the Company and the Holder.

      10. NOTICES, ETC. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon actual delivery to the
recipient. All communications shall be sent to the Company and to the Holder at
the addresses listed on the signature page hereof or at such other address as
the Company or Holder may designate by ten (10) days advance written notice to
the other parties hereto.

      11. GOVERNING LAW. This Warrant and all rights, obligations and
liabilities hereunder shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the
State of Delaware as applied to agreements among Delaware residents, made and to
be performed entirely within the State of Delaware without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles.

                                                               EXECUTION VERSION

              AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED BINDING TERM SHEET

      This AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED BINDING TERM SHEET (this
"AMENDMENT") is made effective as of December 27, 2004 by and between NORTHWEST
BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and TOUCAN
CAPITAL FUND II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("TOUCAN").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, the Company and Toucan are party to that certain Binding
Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet originally dated April 26, 2004 and
amended and restated on October 22, 2004 (as so amended and restated, the
"CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK TERM SHEET").

      WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, the Company and its affiliates, if any,
and Toucan and its designees, are entering into Amendment No. 3 (the "THIRD
AMENDMENT") to that certain Amended and Restated Recapitalization Agreement by
and between the parties thereto; and

      WHEREAS, in connection with the Third Amendment, the Company and Toucan
desire to amend the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet as provided herein.

                                    AGREEMENT

      NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
Company and Toucan agree as follows:

      1. The paragraph of the Convertible Preferred Stock Term Sheet entitled
"Warrants:" is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

      "The Company shall issue $6.75 million in warrant coverage on the first
      $6.75 million Convertible Preferred Stock purchased for cash (the
      "Preferred Stock Warrants"). Preferred Stock Warrants shall not be issued
      upon conversion of notes, exercise of warrants, or other conversion or
      exercise. The number of warrants to be so issued shall be determined on
      the basis of $0.10 per share. If the total of $6.75 million is invested in
      Convertible Preferred Stock, the number of warrants issued shall be
      exercisable for 67.5 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. The
      exercise price of such Preferred Stock Warrants shall be the lesser of
