                    WAREHOUSING CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WAREHOUSING CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of August 1, 2003 between
MORTGAGEIT, INC., a New York corporation ("Borrower"), and RESIDENTIAL FUNDING
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Lender").

A.   Borrower has requested certain financing from Lender.

B.   Lender has agreed to provide that financing to Borrower subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Agreement.

C.   Subject to Borrower's satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
     5, the "Closing Date" for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     is the date set forth as the Closing Date on the signature page to this
     Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

THE CREDIT

1.1. THE WAREHOUSING COMMITMENT

On the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations of this Agreement,
including Exhibit H, Lender agrees to make Warehousing Advances to Borrower from
the Closing Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the Warehousing
Maturity Date, during which period Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Lender has no obligation to
make Warehousing Advances in excess of the Warehousing Commitment Amount. While
a Default or Event of Default exists, Lender may refuse to make any additional
Warehousing Advances to Borrower. All Warehousing Advances under this Agreement
constitute a single indebtedness, and all of the Collateral is security for the
Warehousing Note and for the performance of all of the Obligations. If the
initial Warehousing Advance has not been made within 90 days after the Closing
Date, the Warehousing Commitment and Lender's obligation to make Warehousing
Advances to Borrower under this Agreement will automatically terminate, and all
Obligations (including any Obligations arising under Section 11.2) will
automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand or other
Notice or requirements of any kinds, all of which Borrower expressly waives.

1.2. EXPIRATION OF WAREHOUSING COMMITMENT

The Warehousing Commitment expires on the earlier of ("Warehousing Maturity
Date"): (a) April 30, 2005, as such date may be extended in writing by Lender,
in its sole discretion, on which date the Warehousing Commitment will expire of
its own term and the Warehousing Advances will become due and payable without
the necessity of Notice or action by Lender; and (b) the date the Warehousing
Commitment is terminated and the Warehousing Advances become due and payable
under Section 10.2.

1.3. WAREHOUSING NOTE

Warehousing Advances are evidenced by Borrower's promissory note, payable to
Lender on the form prescribed by Lender ("Warehousing Note"). The term
"Warehousing Note" as used in this Agreement includes all amendments,
restatements, renewals or replacements of the original

Warehousing Note and all substitutions for it. All terms and provisions of the
Warehousing Note are incorporated into this Agreement.

PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING ADVANCES

2.1. WAREHOUSING ADVANCES

To obtain a Warehousing Advance under this Agreement, Borrower must deliver to
Lender either a completed and signed request for a Warehousing Advance on the
then current form approved by Lender, or an Electronic Advance Request, together
with a list of the Mortgage Loans for which the request is being made and a

Request"), not later than (i) in the case of Electronic Advance Requests, 2:30
p.m. on the Business Day, and (ii) in all other cases, 1 Business Day before the
Business Day on which Borrower desires the Warehousing Advance. Subject to the
delivery of a Warehousing Advance Request and the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, Borrower may obtain a Warehousing Advance
under this Agreement upon compliance with the procedures set forth in this
Section and in the applicable Exhibit B, including delivery to Lender of all
required Collateral Documents. Lender's current form of Warehousing Advance
Request is set forth in Exhibit A. Upon not less than 3 Business Days' prior
Notice to Borrower, Lender may modify its form of Warehousing Advance Request,
RFConnects Pledge Agreement and any other Exhibit or document referred to in
this Section to conform to current legal requirements or Lender practices and,
as so modified, those Exhibits and documents will become part of this Agreement.

INTEREST, PRINCIPAL AND FEES

3.1. INTEREST

3.1(a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Section, Borrower must pay
          interest on the unpaid amount of each Warehousing Advance from the
          date the Warehousing Advance is made until it is paid in full at the
          Interest Rate specified in Exhibit H.

3.1(b)    As long as no Default or Event of Default exists, Borrower is entitled
          to receive a benefit in the form of an "Earnings Credit" on the
          portion of the Eligible Balances maintained in time deposit accounts
          with a Designated Bank, and Borrower is entitled to receive a benefit
          in the form of an "Earnings Allowance" on the portion of the Eligible
          Balances maintained in demand deposit accounts with a Designated Bank.
          Any Earnings Allowance will be used first and any Earnings Credit will
          be used second as a credit against Miscellaneous Fees and Charges
          (including Designated Bank Charges), Warehousing Fees, Wire Fees,
          Warehousing Commitment Fees, Loan Package Fees, and any other fees
          payable under this Agreement, and may be used, at Lender's option, to
          reduce accrued interest. Any Earnings Allowance not used during the
          month in which the benefit was received will be accumulated and must
          be used within 6 months of the month in which the benefit was
          received. As long as no Default or Event of Default exists, any
          Earnings Credit not used during the month in which the benefit was
          received will be used to provide a cash benefit to Borrower. Any
          Earnings Credit retained by Lender as a result of a Default or Event
          of Default will be applied to the payment of Borrower's Obligations in
          the order Lender determines in its sole discretion. The Earnings
          Credit and the Earnings Allowance for any month will be determined by
          Lender in its sole discretion and Lender's determination of those
          amounts is conclusive and binding absent manifest error. In no event
          will the benefit received by Borrower exceed the Depository Benefit.

          Either party to this Agreement may terminate the benefits provided for
          in this Section effective immediately upon Notice to the other party,
          if the terminating party determines (which determination is conclusive
          and binding on the other party, absent manifest error) at any time
          that any applicable law, rule, regulation, order or decree or any
          interpretation or administration of such law, rule, regulation, order
          or decree by any governmental authority charged with its
          interpretation or administration, or compliance by such party with any
          request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
          such authority, makes it unlawful or impossible for the party sending
          the Notice to continue to offer or receive the benefits provided for
          in this Section. No Notice is required for a termination of benefits
          as a result of a Default or Event of Default.

3.1(c)    Lender computes interest on the basis of the actual number of days in
          each month and a year of 360 days ("Accrual Basis"). Borrower must pay
          interest monthly in arrears, not later than 9 days after the date of
          Lender's invoice or, if applicable, 2 days after the date of Lender's
          account analysis statement, commencing with the first month following
          the Closing Date and on the Warehousing Maturity Date.

3.1(d)    If, for any reason Borrower repays a Warehousing Advance on the same
          day that it was made by Lender, Borrower agrees to pay to Lender an
          administrative fee equal to 1 day of interest on that Warehousing
          Advance at the Interest Rate that would otherwise be applicable under
          Exhibit H. Borrower must pay all administrative fees within 9 days
          after the date of Lender's invoice or, if applicable, within 2 days
          after the date of Lender's account analysis statement.



                                     Page 1
<PAGE>

3.1(e)    After an Event of Default occurs and upon Notice to Borrower by
          Lender, the unpaid amount of each Warehousing Advance will bear
          interest at the Default Rate until paid in full.

3.1(f)    Lender will adjust the rates of interest provided for in this
          Agreement as of the effective date of each change in the applicable
          index. Lender's determination of such rates of interest as of any date
          of determination are conclusive and binding, absent manifest error.

3.2. INTEREST LIMITATION

Lender does not intend, by reason of this Agreement, the Warehousing Note or any
other Loan Document, to receive interest in excess of the amount permitted by
applicable law. If Lender receives any interest in excess of the amount
permitted by applicable law, whether by reason of acceleration of the maturity
of this Agreement, the Warehousing Note or otherwise, Lender will apply the
excess to the unpaid principal balance of the Warehousing Advances and not to
the payment of interest. If all Warehousing Advances have been paid in full and
the Warehousing Commitment has expired or has been terminated, Lender will remit
any excess to Borrower. This Section controls every other provision of all
agreements between Borrower and Lender and is binding upon and available to any
subsequent holder of the Warehousing Note.

3.3. PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS

3.3(a)    Borrower must pay Lender the outstanding principal amount of all
          Warehousing Advances on the Warehousing Maturity Date.

3.3(b)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1, Borrower may prepay any
          portion of the Warehousing Advances without premium or penalty at any
          time.

3.3(c)    Borrower must pay to Lender, without the necessity of prior demand or
          Notice from Lender, and Borrower authorizes Lender to cause the
          Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for, the amount of
          any outstanding Warehousing Advance against a specific Pledged Asset
          upon the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:

          (1) One (1) Business Day elapses from the date a Warehousing Advance
          was made if the Pledged Loan to be funded by that Warehousing Advance
          is not closed and funded.

          (2) Ten (10) Business Days elapse without the return of a Collateral
          Document delivered by Lender to Borrower under a Trust Receipt for
          correction or completion.

          (3) On the date on which a Pledged Loan is determined to have been
          originated based on untrue, incomplete or inaccurate information or
          otherwise to be subject to fraud, whether or not Borrower had
          knowledge of the misrepresentation, incomplete or incorrect
          information or fraud, on the date on which Borrower knows, has reason
          to know, or receives Notice from Lender, that (A) one or more of the
          representations and warranties set forth in Article 9 were inaccurate
          or incomplete in any material respect on any date when made or deemed
          made, or (B) Borrower has failed to perform or comply with any
          covenant, term or condition set forth in Article 9.

          (4) On the date the Pledged Loan or a Lien prior to the Mortgage
          securing repayment of the Pledged Loan is defaulted and remains in
          default for a period of 60 days or more.



                                     Page 2
<PAGE>

          (5) Upon the sale, other disposition or prepayment of any Pledged
          Asset or, with respect to a Pledged Loan included in an Eligible
          Mortgage Pool, upon the sale or other disposition of the related
          Agency Security.

          (6) One (1) Business Day immediately preceding the date scheduled for
          the foreclosure or trustee sale of the premises securing a Pledged
          Loan.

          (7) If the outstanding Warehousing Advances against Pledged Loans of a
          specific type of Eligible Loan exceed the aggregate Purchase
          Commitments for that type of Eligible Loan.

3.3(d)    Upon telephonic or written Notice to Borrower by Lender, Borrower must
          pay to Lender, and Borrower authorizes Lender to cause the Funding
          Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for, the amount of any
          outstanding Warehousing Advance against a specific Pledged Asset upon
          the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:

          (1) For any Pledged Loan, other than an Aged Mortgage Loan, the

          Aged Warehouse Period elapses.

          (2) Forty-five (45) days elapse from the date a Pledged Loan was
          delivered to an Investor or Approved Custodian for examination and
          purchase or for inclusion in a Mortgage Pool, without the purchase
          being made or an Eligible Mortgage Pool being initially certified, or
          upon rejection of a Pledged Loan as unsatisfactory by an Investor or
          Approved Custodian.

          (3) Seven (7) Business Days elapse from the date a Wet Settlement
          Advance was made against a Pledged Loan without receipt by Lender of
          all Collateral Documents relating to the Pledged Loan.

          (4) Three (3) Business Days after the mandatory delivery date of the
          related Purchase Commitment if the specific Pledged Loan or the
          Pledged Security backed by that Pledged Loan has not been delivered
          under the Purchase Commitment prior to such mandatory delivery date,
          or on the date the related Purchase Commitment expires or is
          terminated, unless, in each case, the Pledged Loan or Pledged Security
          is eligible for delivery to another Investor under a comparable
          Purchase Commitment.

          (5) With respect to any Pledged Loan, any of the Collateral Documents,
          upon examination by Lender, are found not to be in compliance with the
          requirements of this Agreement or the related Purchase Commitment.

3.3(e)    In addition to the payments required by Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(c) and
          3.3(d), if the principal amount of any Pledged Loan is prepaid in
          whole or in part while a Warehousing Advance is outstanding against
          the Pledged Loan, Borrower must pay to Lender, without the necessity
          of prior demand or Notice from Lender, and Borrower authorizes Lender
          to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for,
          the amount of the prepayment, to be applied against the Warehousing
          Advance.

3.3(f)    The proceeds of the sale or other disposition of Pledged Assets must
          be paid directly by the Investor to the Cash Collateral Account.
          Borrower must give Notice to Lender in writing or by telephone or by
          RFConnects Delivery to Lender (and if by telephone, followed promptly
          by written Notice) of the Pledged Assets for which proceeds have been
          received. Upon receipt of Borrower's Notice, Lender will apply any
          proceeds deposited into the Cash Collateral Account to the payment of
          the Warehousing


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>

          Advances related to the Pledged Assets identified by Borrower in its
          Notice, and those Pledged Assets will be considered to have been
          redeemed from pledge. Lender is entitled to rely upon Borrower's
          affirmation that deposits in the Cash Collateral Account represent
          payments from Investors for the purchase of the Pledged Assets
          specified by Borrower in its Notice. If the payment from an Investor
          for the purchase of Pledged Assets is less than the outstanding
          Warehousing Advances against the Pledged Assets identified by Borrower
          in its Notice, Borrower must pay to Lender, and Borrower authorizes
          Lender to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating
          Account in, an amount equal to that deficiency. As long as no Default
          or Event of Default exists, Lender will return to Borrower any excess
          payment from an Investor for Pledged Assets.

3.3(g)    Lender reserves the right to revalue any Pledged Loan. Borrower must
          pay to Lender, without the necessity of prior demand or Notice from
          Lender, and Borrower authorizes Lender to cause the Funding Bank to
          charge Borrower's Operating Account for, any amount required after any
          such revaluation to reduce the principal amount of the Warehousing
          Advance outstanding against the revalued Pledged Loan to an amount
          equal to the Advance Rate for the applicable type of Eligible Loan
          multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Mortgage Loan.

3.4. BUYDOWNS

Borrower may prepay a portion of the Warehousing Advances outstanding against
Prime Mortgage Loans (a "Buydown") upon Notice to Lender not later than (a) 1:00
p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day on which
Borrower desires to make a Buydown in the amount of $10,000,000 or more or (b)
1:00 p.m. on the Business Day on which Borrower desires to make a Buydown in an
amount less than $10,000,000. Each Buydown must be in an amount not less than
$5,000, and Buydowns may not exceed the aggregate principal balance of the
Warehousing Advances outstanding against Prime Mortgage Loans. A Buydown is a
reduction in the aggregate amount of the Warehousing Advances outstanding
against Prime Mortgage Loans, but does not represent the prepayment of any
particular Warehousing Advance, and does not entitle Borrower to the release of
any Collateral. Lender may apply Buydowns to reduce interest payable by Borrower
on outstanding Warehousing Advances in any order that Lender determines in its
sole discretion. Unless a Default or Event of Default exists, Borrower may
reborrow all or any portion of a Buydown upon Notice to Lender not later than
(m) 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the Busines Day on which
borrower desires to reborrow $10,000,000 or more or (n) 1:00 p.m. on the
Business Day that Borrower desires to reborrow an amount less than $10,000,000.
If Lender receives Buydowns or a combination of Buydowns and payments of
Warehousing Advances that exceed the aggregate principal balance of the
Warehousing Advances outstanding against Prime Mortgage Loans (an "Excess
Buydown"), as long as no Default or Event of Default exists, Borrower may
reborrow all or any portion of an Excess Buydown upon Notice to Lender not later
than (y) 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day on
which Borrower desires to reborrow $10,000,000 or more or (z) 1:00 p.m. on the
Business Day that Borrower desires to reborrow an amount less than $10,000,000.
Alternatively, Lender may, in its sole discretion, re-advance to Borrower all or
any portion of an Excess Buydown by causing the Funding Bank to credit the
Operating Account in that amount. Lender has no obligation to pay or otherwise
provide to Borrower any interest, dividends or other benefits on an Excess
Buydown.

3.5. WAREHOUSING COMMITMENT FEES

Borrower must pay Lender a fee ("Warehousing Commitment Fee") in the amount set
forth in Exhibit I. The Warehousing Commitment Fee is payable quarterly in
advance. On the Closing Date, Borrower must pay the prorated portion of the
Warehousing Commitment Fee due from the Closing Date to the last day of the
current Calendar Quarter. After the Closing Date, Borrower must pay the
Warehousing Commitment Fee within 9 days after the date of Lender's invoice or,
if


                                     Page 4
<PAGE>

applicable, within 2 days after the date of Lender's account analysis statement.
If the date set forth in clause (a) of the definition of Warehousing Maturity
Date occurs on a day other than the last day of a Calendar Quarter, Borrower
must pay the prorated portion of the Warehousing Commitment Fee due from the
beginning of the then current Calendar Quarter to and including that date.
Borrower is not entitled to a reduction in the amount of the Warehousing
Commitment Fee if (a) the Warehousing Commitment Amount is reduced or (b) the
Warehousing Commitment is terminated at the request of Borrower or as a result
of an Event of Default. If the Warehousing Commitment terminates at the request
of Borrower or as a result of an Event of Default, Borrower must pay, on the
date of termination, a Warehousing Commitment Fee on the Warehousing Commitment
Amount in effect immediately prior to termination, for the period from the date
of termination to and including the date set forth in clause (a) of the
definition of Warehousing Maturity Date on the date of such termination.
Lender's determination of the Warehousing Commitment Fee for any period is
conclusive and binding, absent manifest error.

3.6. LOAN PACKAGE FEES, WIRE FEES, WAREHOUSING FEES

At the time of each Warehousing Advance against an Eligible Loan, Borrower will
incur a loan package fee ("Loan Package Fee") and a wire fee ("Wire Fee"). Loan
Package Fees and Wire Fees may, at Lender's discretion, be billed separately or
combined into a single warehousing fee ("Warehousing Fee"). Borrower must pay
all Loan Package Fees, Wire Fees or Warehousing Fees in the amount set forth in
Exhibit I within 9 days after the date of Lender's invoice or, if applicable,
within 2 days after the date of Lender's account analysis statement.

3.7. MISCELLANEOUS FEES AND CHARGES

Borrower must reimburse Lender for all Miscellaneous Fees and Charges. Borrower
must pay all Miscellaneous Fees and Charges within 9 days after the date of
Lender's invoice or, if applicable, within 2 days after the date of Lender's
account analysis statement.

3.8. OVERDRAFT ADVANCES

If, under the authorization given by Borrower in the Funding Bank Agreement or
pursuant to this Agreement, Lender debits Borrower's Operating Account or
directs the Funding Bank to honor an item presented against the Operating
Account or against the Check Disbursement Account, and that debit or direction
results in an overdraft, Lender may make an additional Warehousing Advance to
fund that overdraft ("Overdraft Advance"). Borrower must pay (a) the outstanding
amount of any Overdraft Advance, within 1 Business Day after the date of the
Overdraft Advance, and (b) interest on the amount of the Overdraft Advance, at a
rate per annum equal to the Bank One Prime Rate plus 2%, within 9 days after the
date of Lender's invoice or, if applicable, within 2 days after the date of
Lender's account analysis statement.

3.9. METHOD OF MAKING PAYMENTS

3.9(a)    Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, Borrower must make all
          payments under this Agreement to Lender by the close of business on
          the date when due unless the date is not a Business Day. If the due
          date is not a Business Day, payment is due on, and interest will
          accrue to, the next Business Day. Borrower must make all payments in
          United States dollars in immediately available funds transferred by
          wire to accounts designated by Lender.

3.9(b)    Borrower authorizes Lender to cause the Funding Bank to charge
          Borrower's Operating Account for any interest or fees due and payable
          to Lender on or after the 9th day after the date of Lender's invoice
          or, if applicable, on or after the 2nd day after the date of Lender's
          account analysis statement, without the necessity of prior demand or
          Notice from Lender.

3.9(c)    While a Default or Event of Default exists, Borrower authorizes Lender
          to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for
          any Obligations due and payable to Lender, without the necessity of
          prior demand or Notice from Lender.

4.3. RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST IN PLEDGED LOANS AND PLEDGED SECURITIES

4.3(a)    Except as provided in Section 4.3(b), Lender will release its security
          interest in the Pledged Loans only against payment to Lender of the

          included in the Mortgage Pool is not released before the issuance of
          the related Mortgage-backed Security, then that Mortgage-backed
          Security, when issued, is a Pledged Security, Lender's security
          interest continues in the Pledged Loans backing that Pledged Security
          and Lender is entitled to possession of the Pledged Security in the
          manner provided in this Agreement.

4.3(b)    If Pledged Loans are transferred to an Approved Custodian and included
          in an Eligible Mortgage Pool, Lender's security interest in the
          Pledged Loans included in the Eligible Mortgage Pool will be released
          upon the delivery of the Agency Security to Lender (including delivery
          to or registration in the name of a third party on behalf of Lender)
          and that Agency Security is a Pledged Security. Lender's security
          interest in that Pledged Security will be released only against
          payment to Lender of the Release Amount in connection with the
          Mortgage Loans backing that Pledged Security.

4.3(c)    Lender has the exclusive right to possession of all Pledged Securities
          or, if Pledged Securities are issued in book-entry form or issued in
          certificated form and delivered to a clearing corporation (as that
          term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code of Minnesota) or its
          nominee, Lender has the right to have the Pledged Securities
          registered in the name of a securities intermediary (as that term is
          defined in the Uniform Commercial Code of Minnesota) in an account
          containing only customer securities and


                                     Page 2

          credited to an account of Lender. Lender has no duty or obligation to
          deliver Pledged Securities to an Investor or to credit Pledged
          Securities to the account of an Investor or an Investor's designee
          except against payment for those Pledged Securities. Borrower
          acknowledges that Lender may enter into one or more standing
          arrangements with securities intermediaries with respect to Pledged
          Securities issued in book entry form or issued in certificated form
          and delivered to a clearing corporation or its designee, under which
          the Pledged Securities are registered in the name of the securities
          intermediary, and Borrower agrees, upon request of Lender, to execute
          and deliver to those securities intermediaries Borrower's written
          concurrence in any such standing arrangements.

4.3(d)    If no Default or Event of Default occurs, Borrower may redeem a
          Pledged Loan or Pledged Security from Lender's security interest by
          notifying Lender of its intention to redeem the Pledged Loan or
          Pledged Security from pledge and either (1) paying, or causing an
          Investor to pay, to Lender, for application as a prepayment on the
          principal balance of the Warehousing Note, the Release Amount in
          connection with the Pledged Loan or the Pledged Loans backing that
          Pledged Security, or (2) delivering substitute Collateral that, in
          addition to being acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion, will,
          when included with the remaining Collateral, result in a Warehousing
          Collateral Value of all Collateral held by Lender that is at least
          equal to the aggregate outstanding Warehousing Advances.

4.3(e)    After a Default or Event of Default occurs, Lender may, with no
          liability to Borrower or any Person, continue to release its security
          interest in any Pledged Loan or Pledged Security against payment of
          the Release Amount for that Pledged Loan or for the Pledged Loans
          backing that Pledged Security.

4.3(f)    The amount to be paid by Borrower to obtain the release of Lender's
          security interest in a Pledged Loan ("Release Amount") will be (1) in
          connection with the sale of a Pledged Loan by Borrower, the payment
          required in any bailee letter pursuant to which Lender ships that
          Pledged Loan to an Investor, Approved Custodian, pool custodian or
          other party, (2) in connection with the sale of a Pledged Loan by
          Lender while an Event of Default exists, the amount paid to Lender in
          a commercially reasonable disposition of that Pledged Loan and (3)
          otherwise, until an Event of Default occurs, the principal amount of
          the Warehousing Advance outstanding against the Pledged Loan.

4.4. COLLECTION AND SERVICING RIGHTS

4.4(a)    If no Event of Default exists, Borrower may service and receive and
          collect directly all sums payable to Borrower in respect of the
          Collateral other than proceeds of any Purchase Commitment or proceeds
          of the sale of any Collateral. All proceeds of any Purchase Commitment
          or any other sale of Collateral must be paid directly to the Cash
          Collateral Account for application as provided in this Agreement.

4.4(b)    After an Event of Default, Lender or its designee is entitled to
          service and receive and collect all sums payable to Borrower in

Borrower and each Subsidiary of Borrower has good, valid, insurable and (in the

(whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) reflected on the financial
statements described in Section 6.6, except for those properties and assets that
Borrower has disposed of since the date of those financial statements either in
the ordinary course of business or because they were no longer used or useful in
the conduct of Borrower's or the Subsidiary's business. All of Borrower's
properties and assets are free and clear of all Liens except as disclosed in
Borrower's financial statements.

6.14. ERISA

Each Plan is in compliance with all applicable requirements of ERISA and the
Internal Revenue Code and with all material applicable rulings and regulations
issued under the provisions of


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>

ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code setting forth those requirements, except
where any failure to comply would not result in a material loss to Borrower or
any ERISA Affiliate. All of the minimum funding standards or other contribution

G. Borrower has made all filings and taken all other action as may be required
under the laws of any jurisdiction in which it originates Mortgage Loans or
otherwise conducts business under any assumed name. Borrower's use of the
assumed names set forth on Exhibit G does not conflict with any other Person's
legal rights to any such name, nor otherwise give rise to any liability by
Borrower to any other Person. Borrower may amend Exhibit G to add or delete any
assumed names used by Borrower to conduct business. An amendment to Exhibit G to
add an assumed name is not effective until Borrower has delivered to Lender an
assumed name certificate in the jurisdictions in which the assumed name is to be
used, which must be satisfactory in form and content to Lender, in its sole
discretion. In connection with any amendment to delete a name from Exhibit G,
Borrower represents and warrants that it has ceased using that assumed name in
all jurisdictions.

6.17. SERVICING

Borrower's Servicing Contracts are in full force and effect, and are
unencumbered by Liens other than Liens disclosed in Exhibit C. No default or
event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, exists
under any of Borrower's Servicing Contracts.

10.2. REMEDIES

10.2(a)   If an Event of Default described in Section 10.1(g) occurs with
          respect to Borrower, the Warehousing Commitment will automatically
          terminate and the unpaid principal amount of and accrued interest on
          the Warehousing Note and all other Obligations will automatically

          Borrower, terminate the Warehousing Commitment and declare the
          Obligations to be immediately due and payable.

10.2(c)   If any Event of Default occurs, Lender may also take any of the
          following actions:

                                     Page 2
<PAGE>

          (1) Foreclose upon or otherwise enforce its security interest in any
          Lien on the Collateral to secure all payments and performance of the
          Obligations in any manner permitted by law or provided for in the Loan
          Documents.

          (2) Notify all obligors under any of the Collateral that the
          Collateral has been assigned to Lender (or to another Person
          designated by Lender) and that all payments on that Collateral are to
          be made directly to Lender (or such other Person); settle, compromise
          or release, in whole or in part, any amounts any obligor or Investor
          owes on any of the Collateral on terms acceptable to Lender; enforce
          payment and prosecute any action or proceeding involving any of the
          Collateral; and where any Collateral is in default, foreclose on and
          enforce any Liens securing that Collateral in any manner permitted by
          law and sell any property acquired as a result of those enforcement
          actions.

          (3) Prepare and submit for filing Uniform Commercial Code amendment
          statements evidencing the assignment to Lender or its designee of any
          Uniform Commercial Code financing statement filed in connection with
          any item of Collateral.

          (4) Act, or contract with a third party to act, at Borrower's expense,
          as servicer or subservicer of Collateral requiring servicing, and
          perform all obligations required under any Collateral, including
          Servicing Contracts and Purchase Commitments.

          (5) Require Borrower to assemble and make available to Lender the
          Collateral and all related books and records at a place designated by
          Lender.

          (6) Enter onto property where any Collateral or related books and
          records are located and take possession of those items with or without
          judicial process; and obtain access to Borrower's data processing
          equipment, computer hardware and software relating to the Collateral
          and use all of the foregoing and the information contained in the
          foregoing in any manner Lender deems necessary for the purpose of
          effectuating its rights under this Agreement and any other Loan
          Document.

          (7) Before the disposition of the Collateral, prepare it for
          disposition in any manner and to the extent Lender deems appropriate.

          (8) Exercise all rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the
          Uniform Commercial Code of Minnesota or other applicable law,
          including selling or otherwise disposing of all or any portion of the
          Collateral at one or more public or private sales, whether or not the
          Collateral is present at the place of sale, for cash or credit or
          future delivery, on terms and conditions and in the manner as Lender
          may determine, including sale under any applicable Purchase
          Commitment. Borrower waives any right it may have to prior notice of
          the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral to the extent allowed
          by applicable law. If notice is required under applicable law, Lender
          will give Borrower not less than 10 days' notice of any public sale or
          of the date after which any private sale may be held. Borrower agrees
          that 10 days' notice is reasonable notice. Lender may, without notice
          or publication, adjourn any public or private sale one or more times
          by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and the sale
          may be held at any time or place announced at the adjournment. In the
          case of a sale of all or any portion of the Collateral on credit or
          for future delivery, the Collateral sold on those terms may be
          retained by Lender until the purchaser pays the selling price or takes
          possession of the Collateral. Lender has no liability to Borrower if a
          purchaser fails to pay for or take possession of Collateral sold on
          those terms, and in the case of any such failure, Lender may sell the
          Collateral again upon notice complying with this Section.

          (9) Instead of or in conjunction with exercising the power of sale
          authorized by Section 10.2(c)(8), Lender may proceed by suit at law or
          in equity to collect all amounts


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>

          due on the Collateral, or to foreclose Lender's Lien on and sell all
          or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to a judgment or decree of a
          court of competent jurisdiction.

          (10) Proceed against Borrower on the Warehousing Note or against any
          Guarantor under the Guaranty.

          (11) Retain all excess proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
          the Collateral, and apply them to the payment of the Obligations under
          Section 10.3.

10.2(d)   Lender will incur no liability as a result of the commercially
          reasonable sale or other disposition of all or any portion of the
          Collateral at any public or private sale or other disposition.
          Borrower waives (to the extent permitted by law) any claims it may
          have against Lender arising by reason of the fact that the price at
          which the Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less
          than the price that Lender might have obtained at a public sale, or
          was less than the aggregate amount of the outstanding Warehousing
          Advances, accrued and unpaid interest on those Warehousing Advances,
          and unpaid fees, even if Lender accepts the first offer received and
          does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree. Borrower
          agrees that any sale of Collateral under the terms of a Purchase
          Commitment, or any other disposition of Collateral arranged by
          Borrower, whether before or after the occurrence of an Event of
          Default, will be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable
          manner.

10.2(e)   Borrower acknowledges that Mortgage Loans are collateral of a type
          that is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations
          and that Mortgage-backed Securities are collateral of a type that is
          customarily sold on a recognized market. Borrower waives any right it
          may have to prior notice of the sale of Pledged Securities, and agrees
          that Lender may purchase Pledged Loans and Pledged Securities at a
          private sale of such Collateral.

10.2(f)   Borrower specifically waives and releases (to the extent permitted by
          law) any equity or right of redemption, stay or appraisal that
          Borrower has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing
          or adopted after the date of this Agreement, and any right to require
          Lender to (1) proceed against any Person, (2) proceed against or
          exhaust any of the Collateral or pursue its rights and remedies
          against the Collateral in any particular order, or (3) pursue any
          other remedy within its power. Lender is not required to take any
          action to preserve any rights of Borrower against holders of mortgages
          having priority to the Lien of any Mortgage or Security Agreement
          included in the Collateral or to preserve Borrower's rights against
          other prior parties.

10.2(g)   Lender may, but is not obligated to, advance any sums or do any act or
          thing necessary to uphold or enforce the Lien and priority of, or the
          security intended to be afforded by, any Mortgage or Security
          Agreement included in the Collateral, including payment of delinquent
          taxes or assessments and insurance premiums. All advances, charges,
          costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
          disbursements, incurred or paid by Lender in exercising any right,
          power or remedy conferred by this Agreement, or in the enforcement of
          this Agreement, together with interest on those amounts at the Default
          Rate, from the time paid by Lender until repaid by Borrower, are
          deemed to be principal outstanding under this Agreement and the
          Warehousing Note.

10.2(h)   No failure or delay on the part of Lender to exercise any right, power
          or remedy provided in this Agreement or under any other Loan Document,
          at law or in equity, will operate as a waiver of that right, power or
          remedy. No single or partial exercise by Lender of any right, power or
          remedy provided under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, at
          law or in equity, precludes any other or further exercise of that
          right, power, or remedy by Lender, or Lender's exercise of any other
          right, power or remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower
          waives all defenses based on the statute of limitations to the extent


                                     Page 4
<PAGE>

          permitted by law. The remedies provided in this Agreement and the
          other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
          remedies provided at law or in equity.

10.2(i)   Borrower grants Lender a license or other right to use, without
          charge, Borrower's computer programs, other programs, labels, patents,
          copyrights, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names,
          trademarks, service marks and advertising matter, or any property of a
          similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral, in advertising for
          sale and selling any of the Collateral and Borrower's rights under all
          licenses and all other agreements related to the foregoing inure to
          Lender's benefit until the Obligations are paid in full.

10.3. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

Lender may apply the proceeds of any sale, disposition or other enforcement of
Lender's Lien on all or any portion of the Collateral to the payment of the
Obligations in the order Lender determines in its sole discretion. From and
after the indefeasible payment to Lender of all of the Obligations, any
remaining proceeds of the Collateral will be paid to Borrower, or to its
successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If
the proceeds of any sale, disposition or other enforcement of the Collateral are
insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of that sale, disposition or other
enforcement and payment in full of all Obligations, Borrower is liable for the
deficiency.

10.4. LENDER APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT

Borrower appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution,
for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, the
Warehousing Note and the other Loan Documents and taking any action and
executing any instruments that Lender deems necessary or advisable to accomplish
that purpose. Borrower's appointment of Lender as attorney-in-fact is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Lender may give notice of its Lien on the Collateral to any Person,
either in Borrower's name or in its own name, endorse all Pledged Loans or
Pledged Securities payable to the order of Borrower, change or cause to be
changed the book-entry registration or name of subscriber or Investor on any
Pledged Security, prepare and submit for filing Uniform Commercial Code
amendment statements with respect to any Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements filed in connection with any item of Collateral or receive, endorse
and collect all checks made payable to the order of Borrower representing
payment on account of the principal of or interest on, or the proceeds of sale
of, any of the Pledged Loans or Pledged Securities and give full discharge for
those transactions.

10.5. RIGHT OF SET-OFF

If Borrower defaults in the payment of any Obligation or in the performance of
any of its duties under the Loan Documents, Lender may, without Notice to or
demand on Borrower (which Notice or demand Borrower expressly waives), set-off,
appropriate or apply any property of Borrower held at any time by Lender, or any
indebtedness at any time owed by Lender to or for the account of Borrower,
against the Obligations, whether or not those Obligations have matured.

11.2. REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNITY

Borrower must: (a) pay Lender a document production fee in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement in an aggregate amount not to
exceed $25,000 at any time; (b) pay such additional documentation production
fees as Lender may require and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Lender,
including reasonable fees, service charges and disbursements of counsel to
Lender (including allocated costs of internal counsel), in connection with the

costs, expenses and disbursements of every kind or nature (including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Indemnitees (including
allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not the Indemnitees have been
designated as parties to such proceeding) that may be imposed upon, incurred by
or asserted against such Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of
this


                                     Page 1
<PAGE>

Agreement, the Warehousing Note, or any other Loan Document or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Warehousing Note and the other
Loan Documents, including against all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of every kind or
nature (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the
Indemnitees (including allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection with
any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not the
Indemnitees have been designated as parties to such proceeding) arising from any
breach of Sections 9.2(v) or 9.3(f) or the making of any Mortgage Loan in which
any mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor is a Person named in any Restriction
List and to whom the provision of financial services is prohibited or otherwise
restricted by applicable law ("Indemnified Liabilities"), except that Borrower
has no obligation under this Agreement with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such Indemnitees.
To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless as set
forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of
any law or public policy, Borrower must contribute the maximum portion that it
is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees or any
of them. The agreement of Borrower contained in this Article survives the
expiration or termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the
Warehousing Note. Attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in enforcing, or on
appeal from, a judgment under this Agreement are recoverable separately from and
in addition to any other amount included in such judgment, and this clause is
intended to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to
survive and not be merged into such judgment.

11.3. FINANCIAL INFORMATION

All financial statements and reports furnished to Lender under this Agreement
must be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with
that applied in preparing the financial statements as at the end of and for
Borrower's most recent fiscal year (except to the extent otherwise required to
conform to good accounting practice).

11.4. TERMS BINDING UPON SUCCESSORS; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

The terms and provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Borrower, Lender and their respective successors and assigns. All of
Borrower's representations, warranties, covenants and agreements survive the
making of any Warehousing Advance, and except where a longer period is set forth
in this Agreement, remain effective for as long as the Warehousing Commitment is
outstanding or there remain any Obligations to be paid or performed.

11.5. ASSIGNMENT

Borrower cannot assign this Agreement. Lender may at any time, without Notice to
or the consent of Borrower, transfer or assign, in whole or in part, its
interest in this Agreement and the Warehousing Note along with Lender's security
interest in any of the Collateral, and any assignee of Lender may enforce this
Agreement, the Warehousing Note and its security interest in the Collateral
assigned.

11.6. AMENDMENTS

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented unless the amendment, modification or
supplement is set forth in writing signed by both Borrower and Lender.

11.8. PARTICIPATIONS

Lender may at any time sell, assign or grant participations in, or otherwise
transfer to any other Person ("Participant"), all or part of the Obligations.
Without limiting Lender's exclusive right to collect and enforce the
Obligations, Borrower agrees that each participation will give rise to a
debtor-creditor relationship between Borrower and the Participant, and Borrower
authorizes each Participant, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to
proceed directly by right of setoff, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any
assets of Borrower that may be held by that Participant. Borrower authorizes
Lender to disclose to prospective and actual Participants all information in
Lender's possession concerning Borrower, this Agreement and the Collateral.

11.9. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

This Agreement provides for the making and repayment of Warehousing Advances by
Lender (in its capacity as a lender) and Borrower (in its capacity as a
borrower), for the payment of interest on those Warehousing Advances and for the
payment of certain fees by Borrower to Lender. The relationship between Lender
and Borrower is limited to that of creditor and secured party on the part of
Lender and of debtor on the part of Borrower. The provisions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents for compliance with financial covenants and the
delivery of financial statements and other operating reports are intended solely
for the benefit of Lender to protect its interest as a creditor and secured
party. Nothing in this Agreement creates or may be construed as permitting or
obligating Lender to act as a financial or business advisor or consultant to
Borrower, as permitting or obligating Lender to control Borrower or to conduct
Borrower's operations, as creating any fiduciary obligation on the part of
Lender to Borrower, or as creating any joint venture, agency, partnership or
other relationship between Lender and Borrower other than as explicitly and
specifically stated in the Loan Documents. Borrower acknowledges that it has had
the opportunity to obtain the advice of experienced counsel of its own choice in
connection with the negotiation and execution of the Loan Documents and to
obtain the advice of that counsel with respect to all matters contained in the
Loan Documents, including the waivers of jury trial and of punitive,
consequential, special or indirect damages contained in Sections 11.16 and
11.17, respectively. Borrower further acknowledges that it is experienced with
respect to financial and credit matters and has made its own independent
decisions to apply to Lender for credit and to execute and deliver this
Agreement.

11.10. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Agreement is declared to be illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, that provision is null and void and of no force and effect to the
extent of the illegality or unenforceability, and does not affect the validity
or enforceability of any other provision of the Agreement.

11.11. CONSENT TO CREDIT REFERENCES

Borrower consents to the disclosure of information regarding Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and their relationships with Lender to Persons making credit
inquiries to Lender. This consent is revocable by Borrower at any time upon
Notice to Lender as provided in Section 11.1.

11.12. COUNTERPARTS

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will
be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute but one and the same
instrument.

11.13. HEADINGS/CAPTIONS

The captions or headings in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are for
convenience only and in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

11.14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This Agreement, the Warehousing Note and the other Loan Documents represent the
final agreement among the parties with respect to their subject matter, and may
not be contradicted by evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements
among the parties. There are no oral agreements among the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Warehousing Note and the other Loan
Documents.

11.15. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

AT THE OPTION OF LENDER, THIS AGREEMENT, THE WAREHOUSING NOTE AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA. BORROWER CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THOSE COURTS, AND
WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF THOSE COURTS, INCLUDING THE
OBJECTION THAT VENUE IN THOSE COURTS IS NOT CONVENIENT. ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING MAY BE COMMENCED AND INSTITUTED BY SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON BORROWER
BY FIRST CLASS REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, ADDRESSED
TO BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS LAST KNOWN TO LENDER. BORROWER'S CONSENT AND
AGREEMENT UNDER THIS SECTION DOES NOT AFFECT LENDER'S RIGHT TO ACCOMPLISH
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST BORROWER IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION OR
COURT. IN THE EVENT BORROWER COMMENCES ANY ACTION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR
VENUE UNDER ANY TORT OR CONTRACT THEORY ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE
RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, LENDER AT
ITS OPTION MAY HAVE THE CASE TRANSFERRED TO A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE
STATE OF MINNESOTA OR, IF A TRANSFER CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER APPLICABLE
LAW, MAY HAVE BORROWER'S ACTION DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

11.16. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

BORROWER AND LENDER EACH PROMISES AND AGREES NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY A JURY, AND FULLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY TO
THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT NOW EXISTS OR ARISES AFTER THE DATE OF THIS
AGREEMENT. THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS SEPARATELY GIVEN,
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, BY BORROWER AND LENDER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS
EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE FOR WHICH THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WOULD
OTHERWISE APPLY. LENDER AND BORROWER ARE EACH AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED TO SUBMIT
THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY. FURTHER, BORROWER AND LENDER EACH CERTIFIES THAT NO

<PAGE>

REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE OTHER PARTY, INCLUDING THE OTHER PARTY'S COUNSEL,
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, TO ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES OR AGENTS
THAT THE OTHER PARTY WILL NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY.

11.17. WAIVER OF PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES

BORROWER WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO SEEK PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL
OR INDIRECT DAMAGES FROM LENDER OR ANY OF LENDER'S AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ISSUES PRESENTED IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY BORROWER AGAINST LENDER
OR ANY OF LENDER'S AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS WITH
RESPECT TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT. THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO SEEK PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL,
SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY GIVEN BY BORROWER, AND
IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE FOR WHICH THE RIGHT TO
SEEK PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY.
LENDER IS AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED TO SUBMIT THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AS
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO SEEK PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL,
SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES.
