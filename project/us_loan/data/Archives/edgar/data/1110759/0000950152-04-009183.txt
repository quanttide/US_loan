Item 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS

MERGER OF KEY BANK USA WITH AND INTO KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

          Prior to October 1, 2004, Key Bank USA, National Association ("Key
Bank USA") and KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank") were both national
banking associations and wholly-owned by KeyCorp. Effective on October 1, 2004,
Key Bank USA merged with and into KeyBank and, as of that date, KeyBank
succeeded to all assets and liabilities of Key Bank USA. As a result, KeyBank
has succeeded Key Bank USA as "Master Servicer", "Seller" and "Administrator"
under and in accordance with the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement and
other agreements relating to the KeyCorp Student Loan Trust securitization
transaction referenced above and has assumed all other obligations and
liabilities of Key Bank USA in connection with such securitization transaction.
No material changes are expected to occur with regard to the administrative and
servicing operations of the Trust as a result of the merger.

           KeyBank files quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income
("Call Reports") with its primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency. KeyBank's Call Reports are available online at
http://www2.fdic.gov/call_tfr_rpts/. As of September 30, 2004, KeyBank had total
assets of approximately $77.375 billion, total liabilities (including minority
interest in consolidated subsidiaries) of approximately $72.237 billion and
approximately $5.138 billion in stockholder's equity, and Key Bank USA had total
assets of approximately $10.366 billion, total liabilities (including minority
interest in consolidated subsidiaries) of approximately $9.234 billion and
approximately $1.132 billion in stockholder's equity. The principal executive
offices of KeyBank are located at Key Tower, 127 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio
44114, and its telephone number is (216) 689-6300.

On December 27, 2004, the KeyCorp Student Loan Trust 1999-A (the "Trust") made
its regular, quarterly distribution of funds to holders of the Trust's Floating
Rate Asset Backed Certificates and Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes and
distributed the Certificateholder's Statement and Noteholder's Statement, filed
herewith as Exhibits to this Form 8-K, to Certificateholders and Noteholders of
record, respectively.

In reliance upon certain no-action letters, including a letter dated May 9,
1997, issued by the Chief Counsel, Division of Corporate Finance of the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the KeyCorp Student Loan Trust
1996-A, Registration No. 333-4274, the Trust is hereby filing the
Certificateholder's Statement and Noteholder's Statement reflecting the Trust's
activities for the period ending November 30, 2004, including a statistical
summary of the delinquency and default characteristics of the Trust's student
loan portfolio as of such date.
