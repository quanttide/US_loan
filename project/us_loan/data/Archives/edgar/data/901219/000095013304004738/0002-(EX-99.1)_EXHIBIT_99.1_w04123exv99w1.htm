9800 MEDICAL CENTER DRIVE</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>- Action Will Make $76 Million in Additional Cash Available on Balance Sheet -</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROCKVILLE, Maryland &#151; December&nbsp;22, 2004 &#151; Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: HGSI)
announced today that it has completed an agreement under which the company will exit the facility
at 9800 Medical Center Drive as part of its previously disclosed plan to consolidate its operations
into fewer locations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO)&nbsp;will continue to hold title to the facility,
which has served as Human Genome Sciences&#146; research center, and has entered into a new lease with
an undisclosed third party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven C. Mayer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, &#147;The agreement
announced today is an important component of our previously disclosed facilities consolidation
program. It will also free up $76&nbsp;million of cash by eliminating the cash restriction associated
with the financing of 9800 Medical Center Drive. This transaction reduces the total amount of cash
restricted on our balance sheet, which is related to various facility financings, from $294&nbsp;million
to $218&nbsp;million. Most of our employees who are currently working there will be moved to other
Human Genome Sciences locations in Rockville, including our newest facility at 14200 Shady Grove
Road. We will continue to use a portion of the 9800 building for a
period of time, so certain employees will remain there for now and be moved to our other facilities at a later
date.&#148;
