<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We
see a strong and growing future for our financial institution, health administration,
insurance and trust operations. Consequently, we believe there are opportunities to
increase our investments in all of these core businesses,&#148; Muma said. &#147;This
transaction also provides us with additional capital to enhance our already strong
financial position and improve our strategic flexibility. At the same time, we expect that
National Financial can offer our securities clients enhanced capabilities and will provide
them with a continued high level of service.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;This
acquisition firmly demonstrates Fidelity&#146;s continued long-term commitment to the
brokerage business &#150; specifically our correspondent clearing operation &#150; and
will certainly benefit the clients of both National Financial and Fiserv,&#148; said
Robert L. Reynolds, Fidelity vice chairman and chief operating officer. &#147;National
Financial has experienced significant growth with the addition of a number of new clients
just in the past year. This acquisition hastens our growth and adds enormous scale, which
will be a major benefit for our clients.&#148; </FONT></P>
