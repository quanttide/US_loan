Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit
           Plan.

This Current Report discloses an update to the blackout period being
imposed on directors and executive officers of Vertrue Incorporated (the
"Company"), in connection with the extension of its self-tender offer.

On December 15, 2004, the Company announced an extension of its self-tender
offer from 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on December 15, 2004, until 5:00 P.M.,
New York City time, on January 7, 2005, unless the Company extends the tender
offer further. The blackout period imposed in connection with the tender offer
was originally scheduled to begin on December 13, 2004 and end during the week
of December 19, 2004. Because the expiration date of the tender offer was
extended, the dates of the blackout period have changed. The blackout period is
now expected to begin on January 5, 2005 and end during the week of January 17,
2005. On December 20, 2004, the Company sent a notice to its directors and
executive officers informing them of the change in the blackout period dates.
The notice was sent to ensure compliance with Section 306(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

A copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(c)  Exhibits:
     99.1    Notice of Imposition of Blackout Period Pursuant to Section 306 of
             the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 dated December 20, 2004.
