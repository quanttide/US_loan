Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
            ------------------------------------------

        On  December  20,  2004, the Executive  Compensation  and
Employee  Benefits  Committee (the "Committee")  of  the  Haverty
Furniture Companies, Inc. ("Havertys") Board of Directors made  a
number  of restricted stock awards to certain Havertys executives
and key managers, including the following:


                                       Number of
                                      Restricted
                 Name               Shares Awarded
         ------------------       ------------------

         Clarence R. Ridley             15,000
         Clarence H. Smith              20,000
         Dennis L. Fink                 10,000
         M. Tony  Wilkerson              8,000
         Rawson Haverty, Jr.             7,000


   The restricted stock awards were made pursuant to Havertys' 2004
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which was filed  with  the
Securities  and  Exchange Commission with  Havertys'  2004  Proxy
Statement.  A form of the restricted stock award notice is  filed
with this Current Report as Exhibit 10.1.

   The restricted shares vest in accordance with the schedule set
forth  in the restricted stock award notice.  The vesting of  the
shares  may be accelerated if the earnings per share goal set  by
the  Committee is achieved.  If the recipient voluntarily resigns
or is terminated for cause as defined in the Plan, any non-vested
restricted   shares  will  be  forfeited.   If  the   recipient's
employment is ended because of death or disability as defined  in
the Plan, the award will immediately vest.  The restricted shares
may  not  be  sold, assigned, transferred, pledged  or  otherwise
disposed of by the recipient until they vest.  Recipients are not
entitled to receive any cash dividends and have no voting  rights
with  respect  to  the restricted shares until  the  restrictions
lapse.
