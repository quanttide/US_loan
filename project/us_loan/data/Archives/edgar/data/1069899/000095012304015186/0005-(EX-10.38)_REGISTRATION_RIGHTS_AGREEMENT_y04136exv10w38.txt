2.    EXCHANGE OFFER

      (a)   Unless the Exchange Offer would not be permitted by applicable laws
            or a policy of the SEC, the Issuers shall (and shall cause each
            Guarantor with respect to its guarantee to) (i) prepare and file
            with the SEC by the Filing Date, a registration statement (the
            "Exchange Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the
            Securities Act with respect to an offer (the "Exchange Offer") to
            the Holders of Units to issue and deliver to such Holders, in
            exchange for the Units, a like number of Exchange Units, (ii) use
            their reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Registration
            Statement to become effective by the Effectiveness Date, (iii) use
            their reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Registration
            Statement effective for not less than 20 Business Days after the
            Exchange Registration Statement is declared effective, and (iv) use
            their reasonable best efforts to issue on or prior to 30 days after
            the date on which the Exchange Registration Statement is declared
            effective, Exchange Units in exchange for all Units tendered prior
            thereto in the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be
            subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does
            not violate applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the
            staff of the SEC.

      (b)   The Exchange Units and the underlying Exchange Notes shall be issued
            under, and entitled to the benefits of, (i) the Indenture or a trust
            indenture that is identical to the Indenture (other than such
            changes as are necessary to comply with any requirements of the SEC
            to effect or maintain the qualifications thereof under the TIA) and
            (ii) the Collateral Agreements.

      (c)   Interest on the Exchange Notes and Private Exchange Notes will
            accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was
            paid on the Notes surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no
            interest has been paid on the Notes, from the date of original issue
            of the Notes. Each Exchange Note and Private Exchange Note shall
            bear interest at the rate set forth thereon; provided, that interest
            with respect to the period prior to the issuance thereof shall
            accrue at the rate or rates borne by the Notes from time to time
            during such period.

      (d)   The Issuers may require each Holder as a condition to participation
            in the Exchange Offer to represent (i) that any Exchange Units
            received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its
            business, (ii) that at the time of the commencement and consummation
            of the Exchange Offer such Holder has not entered into any
            arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in

<PAGE>

            the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the
            Exchange Units in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act,
            (iii) that if such Holder is an "affiliate" of the either of the
            Issuers or a Guarantor within the meaning of Rule 405 of the
            Securities Act, it will comply with the registration and prospectus
            delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable
            to it, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not
            engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of
            the Units and (v) if such Holder is a Participating Broker-Dealer,
            that it will deliver a Prospectus in connection with any resale of
            the Exchange Units.

      (e)   The Issuers shall include within the Prospectus contained in the
            Exchange Registration Statement a section entitled "Plan of
            Distribution" which shall contain a summary statement of the
            positions taken or policies made by the staff of the SEC with
            respect to the potential "underwriter" status of any broker-dealer
            that is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
            Exchange Act) of Exchange Units received by such broker-dealer in
            the Exchange Offer for its own account in exchange for Units that
            were acquired by it as a result of market-making or other trading
            activity (a "Participating Broker-Dealer"), whether such positions
            or policies have been publicly disseminated by the staff of the SEC
            or such positions or policies, in the judgment of the Initial
            Purchaser, represent the prevailing views of the staff of the SEC.
            Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also allow, to the extent
            permitted by applicable policies and regulations of the SEC, the use
            of the Prospectus by all Persons subject to the prospectus delivery
            requirements of the Securities Act, including, to the extent so
            permitted, all Participating Broker-Dealers, and include a statement
            describing the manner in which Participating Broker-Dealers may
            resell the Exchange Units. The Issuers shall use their reasonable
            best efforts to keep the Exchange Registration Statement effective
            and to amend and supplement the Prospectus contained therein, in
            order to permit such Prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all
            Persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the
            Securities Act for such period of time as such Persons must comply
            with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Units (the
            "Applicable Period").

      (f)   If, upon consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Initial Purchaser
            holds any Units acquired by it and having the status of an unsold
            allotment in the initial distribution, the Issuers (upon the written
            request from the Initial Purchaser) shall, simultaneously with the
            delivery of the Exchange Units in the Exchange Offer, issue and
            deliver to the Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the "Private
            Exchange") for the Units held by the Initial Purchaser, a like
            principal amount of Exchange Units that are identical to the Units,
            except for the existence of restrictions on transfer thereof under
            the Securities Act and securities laws of the several states of the
            United States (the "Private Exchange Units" and the Exchange Notes
            underlying the Units the "Private Exchange Notes") (and which are
            issued pursuant to the same indenture as the Exchange Units and
            Exchange Notes). The Private Exchange Units shall bear the same
            CUSIP number as the Exchange Units.

<PAGE>

      (g)   In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Issuers shall (and shall
            cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to):

            (i)   mail to each Holder a copy of the Prospectus forming part of
                  the Exchange Registration Statement, together with an
                  appropriate letter of transmittal that is an exhibit to the
                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any related
                  documents;

            (ii)  keep the Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 Business
                  Days after the date on which the Exchange Registration
                  Statement is declared effective;

            (iii) utilize the services of a depository for the Exchange Offer
                  with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
                  York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate thereof;

            (iv)  permit Holders to withdraw tendered Registrable Units at any
                  time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the
                  last Business Day on which the Exchange Offer shall remain
                  open; and

            (v)   otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable
                  laws.

      (h)   As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer or the
            Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Issuers shall (and shall
            cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to):

            (i)   accept for exchange all Registrable Units validly tendered
                  pursuant to the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the
                  case may be, and not validly withdrawn;

            (ii)  deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Units
                  so accepted for exchange; and

            (iii) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each
                  Holder tendering such Registrable Units, Exchange Units or
                  Private Exchange Units (and the underlying Exchange Notes and
                  Private Exchange Notes), as the case may be, equal in
                  principal amount to the Units of such Holder so accepted for
                  exchange.

      (i)   The Exchange Units and the Private Exchange Units (and the
            underlying Exchange Notes and Private Exchange Notes) may be issued
            under (i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture identical to the
            Indenture (other than such changes as are necessary to comply with
            any requirements of the SEC to effect or maintain the qualification
            thereof under the TIA), which in either event will provide that the
            Exchange Units will not be subject to the transfer restrictions set
            forth in the Indenture, and that the Exchange Units, the Private
            Exchange Units and the Units, if any, will be deemed one class of
            security (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) and entitled
            to participate in all the respective security granted by the

<PAGE>

            Issuers pursuant to the Collateral Agreements and in any Subsidiary
            Guarantee (as such terms are defined in the Indenture) on an equal
            and ratable basis.

      (j)   If: (i) applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC would not
            permit the consummation of the Exchange Offer; (ii) subsequent to
            the consummation of the Private Exchange, any Holder of Private
            Exchange Units so requests; (iii) the Exchange Offer is not
            consummated by the 210th day following the Closing Date; or (iv) (A)
            any Holder is prohibited by law or Commission policy form
            participating in the Exchange Offer, (B) if the Initial Purchaser so
            requests with respect to Units not eligible to be exchanged for
            Exchange Units in the Exchange Offer, (C) any Holder participating
            in the Exchange Offer receives Exchange Units that may not be sold
            without restriction under state and federal securities laws (other
            than due solely to the status of such Holder as an affiliate of the
            Issuers within the meaning of the Securities Act) or (D) any
            broker-dealer holds Units acquired directly from the Issuers or any
            of their affiliates and, in each such case contemplated by this
            clause (v), and such Holder notifies the Issuers within six months
            of consummation of the Exchange Offer, then the Issuers shall
            promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) deliver to the
            Holders (or in the case of an occurrence of any event described in
            clause (v) of this Section 2(j), to any such Holder) and the Trustee
            written notice thereof (the "Shelf Notice") and shall promptly (but
            in no event later than the Shelf Filing Date) file an Initial Shelf
            Registration pursuant to Section 3.

3.    SHELF REGISTRATION

      If a Shelf Notice is delivered pursuant to Section 2(j), then this Section
3 shall apply to all Registrable Units. Otherwise, upon consummation of the
Exchange Offer in accordance with Section 2, the provisions of this Section 3
shall apply solely with respect to (i) Units held by any Holder thereof not
permitted to participate in the Exchange Offer, (ii) Units held by any
broker-dealer that acquired such Units directly from the Issuers or any of their
affiliates and (iii) Exchange Units that are not freely tradeable as
contemplated by Section 2(j)(v) hereof, provided in each case that the relevant
Holder has duly notified the Issuers within six months of the Exchange Offer as
required by Section 2(j)(v).

      (a)   Initial Shelf Registration. The Issuers shall (and shall cause each
            Subsidiary Guarantor to), promptly, file with the SEC a Registration
            Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant
            to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Units (the "Initial
            Shelf Registration"). If the Issuers (and any Subsidiary Guarantor)
            have not yet filed an Exchange Registration Statement, the Issuers
            shall (and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to) file with the
            SEC the Initial Shelf Registration on or prior to the Filing Date
            and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Initial
            Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act
            on or prior to the Effectiveness Date. Otherwise, the Issuers shall
            (and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to) use their reasonable
            best efforts to file with the SEC the Initial Shelf Registration
            within 30 days of the delivery of the Shelf Notice and shall use
            their reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration to be
            declared effective under the

<PAGE>

            Securities Act as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in no
            event more than 90 days after delivery of the Shelf Notice). The
            Initial Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-1 or another
            appropriate form permitting registration of such Registrable Units
            for resale by Holders in the manner or manners reasonably designated
            by them (including, without limitation, one or more underwritten
            offerings). The Issuers and Subsidiary Guarantors shall not permit
            any securities other than the Registrable Units to be included in
            any Shelf Registration. The Issuers shall (and shall cause each
            Subsidiary Guarantor to) use their reasonable best efforts to keep
            the Initial Shelf Registration continuously effective under the
            Securities Act until the date which is 24 months from the Closing
            Date (subject to extension pursuant to the last paragraph of Section
            6(v) (the "Effectiveness Period"), or such shorter period ending
            when (i) all Registrable Units covered by the Initial Shelf
            Registration have been sold in the manner set forth and as
            contemplated in the Initial Shelf Registration (ii) a Subsequent
            Shelf Registration covering all of the Registrable Units covered by
            and not sold under the Initial Shelf Registration or an earlier
            Subsequent Shelf Registration has been declared effective under the
            Securities Act or (iii) there cease to be any outstanding
            Registrable Units.

      (b)   Subsequent Shelf Registrations. If the Initial Shelf Registration or
            any Subsequent Shelf Registration (as defined below) ceases to be
            effective for any reason at any time during the Effectiveness Period
            (other than because of the sale of all of the securities registered
            thereunder), the Issuers shall (and shall cause each Subsidiary
            Guarantor to) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the prompt
            withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in
            any event shall within 30 days of such cessation of effectiveness
            amend such Shelf Registration in a manner designed to obtain the
            withdrawal of the order suspending the effectiveness thereof, or
            file (and cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to file) an additional
            "shelf" Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of
            the Registrable Units (a "Subsequent Shelf Registration"). If a
            Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Issuers shall (and shall
            cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to) use their reasonable best
            efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration to be declared
            effective as soon as practicable after such filing and to keep such
            Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously effective for a period
            equal to the number of days in the Effectiveness Period less the
            aggregate number of days during which the Initial Shelf Registration
            or any Subsequent Shelf Registration was previously effective. As
            used herein the term "Shelf Registration" means the Initial Shelf
            Registration and any Subsequent Shelf Registrations

      (c)   Supplements and Amendments. The Issuers shall promptly supplement
            and amend any Shelf Registration if required by the rules,
            regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used
            for such Shelf Registration, if required by the Securities Act, or
            if requested in writing by the Holders of a majority in aggregate
            principal amount of the Registrable Units covered by such Shelf
            Registration or if reasonably requested by any underwriter of such
            Registrable Units.

4.    ADDITIONAL INTEREST

      (a)   The Issuers acknowledge and agree that the Holders of Registrable
            Units will suffer damages if the Issuers fail to fulfill their
            material obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof and that it
            would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with
            precision. Accordingly, the Issuers agree to pay additional cash
            interest on the Notes ("Additional Interest") under the
            circumstances and to the extent set forth below (each of which shall
            be given independent effect):

            (i)   if neither the Exchange Registration Statement nor the Initial
                  Shelf Registration has been filed on or prior to the Filing
                  Date, Additional Interest shall accrue on the Notes over and
                  above any stated interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum of the
                  principal amount of such Notes for the first 90 days
                  immediately following the Filing Date, such Additional
                  Interest rate increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum at
                  the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period;

            (ii)  if neither the Exchange Registration Statement nor the Initial
                  Shelf Registration is declared effective on or prior to the
                  Effectiveness Date, Additional Interest shall accrue on the
                  Notes over and above any stated interest at a rate of 0.25%
                  per annum of the principal amount of such Notes for the first
                  90 days immediately following the Effectiveness Date, such
                  Additional Interest rate increasing by an additional 0.25% per
                  annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period;

            (iii) if (A) the Issuers have not exchanged Exchange Units for all
                  Units validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
                  Exchange Offer on or prior to 30 days after the Effectiveness
                  Date, (B) the Exchange Registration Statement ceases to be
                  effective at any time prior to the expiration of 20 Business
                  Days thereafter, (C) if applicable, a Shelf Registration has
                  been declared effective and such Shelf Registration ceases to
                  be effective at any time prior to the second anniversary of
                  its effective date (other than such time as all Units have
                  been disposed of thereunder) and is not declared effective
                  again within 30 days, or (D) pending the announcement of a
                  material corporate transaction, the Issuers issue a written
                  notice pursuant to Section 6(e)(v) or (vi) that a Shelf
                  Registration Statement or Exchange Registration Statement is
                  unusable and the aggregate number of days in any 365-day
                  period for which all such notices issued or required to be
                  issued, have been, or were required to be, in effect exceeds
                  120 days in the aggregate or 30 days consecutively, in the
                  case of a Shelf Registration statement, or 15 days in the
                  aggregate in the case of an Exchange Registration Statement,
                  then Additional Interest shall accrue on the Notes, over and
                  above any stated interest, at a rate of 0.25% per annum of the
                  principal amount of such Notes commencing on (w) the 31st day
                  after the Effectiveness Date, in the case of (A) above, or (x)
                  the date the Exchange Registration Statement ceases to be
                  effective without being declared effective again within 30
                  days, in the case of clause (B) above, or (y) the

<PAGE>

                  day such Shelf Registration ceases to be effective in the case
                  of (C) above, or (z) the day the Exchange Registration
                  Statement or Shelf Registration ceases to be usable in case of
                  clause (D) above, such Additional Interest rate increasing by
                  an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each such
                  subsequent 90-day period;

            provided, however, that the maximum Additional Interest rate on the
            Notes may not exceed at any one time in the aggregate 1.00% per
            annum; and provided further, that (1) upon the filing of the
            Exchange Registration Statement or Initial Shelf Registration (in
            the case of (i) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange
            Registration Statement or Initial Shelf Registration (in the case of
            (ii) above), or (3) upon the exchange of Exchange Units for all
            Units tendered (in the case of (iii)(A) above), or upon the
            effectiveness of the Exchange Registration Statement that had ceased
            to remain effective (in the case of clause (iii)(B) above), or upon
            the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration which had ceased to remain
            effective (in the case of (iii)(C) above), Additional Interest on
            the Notes as a result of such clause (or the relevant subclause
            thereof) or upon the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or
            Exchange Registration Statement (in the case of clause (iii)(D)
            above), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue.

      (b)   The Issuers shall notify the Trustee within 5 Business Days after
            each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which
            Additional Interest is required to be paid (an "Event Date"). Any
            amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (a)(i),
            (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of this Section 4 will be payable in cash, on
            the dates and in the manner provided in the Indenture and whether or
            not any cash interest would then be payable on such date, commencing
            with the first such semi-annual date occurring after any such
            Additional Interest commences to accrue. The amount of Additional
            Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional
            Interest rate by the principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by a
            fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such
            Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period
            (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
            30-day months and, in the case of a partial month, the actual number
            of days elapsed), and the denominator of which is 360.

5.    HOLD-BACK AGREEMENTS

      The Issuers agree that they will not effect any public or private sale or
distribution (including a sale pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities
Act) of any securities the same as or similar to those covered by a Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof (other than Additional Units
(as defined in the Indenture) issued under the Indenture), or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the
10 days prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the effective date
of any Registration Statement filed pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 hereof unless
the Holders of a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the Registrable
Units to be included in such Registration Statement consent, if the managing
underwriter thereof so requests in writing.

<PAGE>

6.    REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

      In connection with the filing of any Registration Statement pursuant to
Sections 2 or 3 hereof, the Issuers shall (and shall cause each Subsidiary
Guarantor to) effect such registrations to permit the sale of such securities
covered thereby in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition
thereof, and pursuant thereto and in connection with any Registration Statement
filed by the Issuers hereunder, the Issuers shall (and shall cause each
Subsidiary Guarantor to):

      (a)   Prepare and file with the SEC on or prior to the Filing Date, the
            Exchange Registration Statement or if the Exchange Registration
            Statement is not filed because of the circumstances contemplated by
            Section 2(j), a Shelf Registration as prescribed by Section 3, and
            use their reasonable best efforts to cause each such Registration
            Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided
            herein; provided that, if (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant
            to Section 3 or (2) a Prospectus contained in an Exchange
            Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 is required to be
            delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating
            Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Units during the Applicable
            Period relating thereto, before filing any Registration Statement or
            Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto the Issuers
            shall (and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to), if requested,
            furnish to and afford the Holders of the Registrable Units to be
            registered pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, each
            Participating Broker-Dealer, the managing underwriters, if any, and
            each of their respective counsel, a reasonable opportunity to review
            copies of all such documents (including copies of any documents to
            be incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto)
            proposed to be filed (in each case at least 5 Business Days prior to
            such filing). The Issuers and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall not
            file any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments
            or supplements thereto in respect of which the Holders must provide
            information for the inclusion therein without the Holders being
            afforded an opportunity to review such documentation if the holders
            of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Units
            covered by such Registration Statement, or any such Participating
            Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, the managing underwriters, if
            any, or any of their respective counsel shall reasonably object in
            writing on a timely basis. A Holder shall be deemed to have
            reasonably objected to such filing if such Registration Statement,
            amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to
            be filed, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits
            to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein
            not misleading or fails to comply with the applicable requirements
            of the Securities Act.

      (b)   Provide an indenture trustee for the Registrable Units, the Exchange
            Units or the Private Exchange Units, as the case may be, and cause
            the Indenture (or other indenture relating to the Registrable Units)
            to be qualified under the TIA not later than the effective date of
            the first Registration Statement; and in connection therewith, to
            effect such changes to such indenture as may be required for such
            indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the
            TIA; and execute,

<PAGE>

            and use their reasonable best efforts to cause such trustee to
            execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes,
            and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC
            to enable such indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner.

      (c)   Prepare and file with the SEC such pre-effective amendments and
            post-effective amendments to each Shelf Registration or Exchange
            Registration Statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to
            keep such Registration Statement continuously effective for the
            Effectiveness Period or the Applicable Period, as the case may be;
            cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any Prospectus
            supplement required by applicable law, and as so supplemented to be
            filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force)
            promulgated under the Securities Act; and comply with the provisions
            of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to them with
            respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
            Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so
            supplemented and with respect to the subsequent resale of any
            securities being sold by a Participating Broker-Dealer covered by
            any such Prospectus. The Issuers and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall
            not, during the Applicable Period, voluntarily and knowingly take
            any action that would result in selling Holders of the Registrable
            Units covered by a Registration Statement or Participating
            Broker-Dealers seeking to sell Exchange Units not being able to sell
            such Registrable Units or such Exchange Units during that period,
            unless such action, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuers, is
            required by applicable law, rule or regulation or permitted by this
            Agreement.

      (d)   Furnish to such selling Holders and Participating Broker-Dealers who
            so request in writing (i) upon the Issuers' receipt, a copy of the
            order of the SEC declaring such Registration Statement and any
            post-effective amendment thereto effective, (ii) such reasonable
            number of copies of the Prospectus included in such Registration
            Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus) and each amendment
            and supplement thereto, and such reasonable number of copies of the
            final Prospectus as filed by the Issuers and each Subsidiary
            Guarantor pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, in
            conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and each
            amendment and supplement thereto, and (iii) such other documents
            (including any amendments required to be filed pursuant to clause
            (c) of this Section), as any such Person may reasonably request in
            writing. The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby consent to
            the use of the Prospectus by each of the selling Holders of
            Registrable Units or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the
            case may be, and the underwriters or agents, if any, and dealers, if
            any, in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable
            Units covered by, or the sale by Participating Broker-Dealers of the
            Exchange Units pursuant to, such Prospectus and any amendment or
            supplement thereto.

      (e)   If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2) a
            Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed
            pursuant to Section 2 is required to be delivered under the
            Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell
            Exchange Units during the Applicable Period relating

<PAGE>

            thereto, the Issuers shall notify in writing the selling Holders of
            Registrable Units, or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the
            case may be, the managing underwriters, if any, and each of their
            respective counsel promptly (but in any event within 2 Business
            Days) (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or
            post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a
            Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the
            same has become effective, (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any
            stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
            or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Prospectus
            or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if at
            any time when a Prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be
            delivered in connection with sales of the Registrable Units the
            representations and warranties of the Issuers and any Subsidiary
            Guarantor contained in any agreement (including any underwriting
            agreement) contemplated by Section 6(n) hereof cease to be true and
            correct in all material respects, (iv) of the receipt by the Issuers
            or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any notification with respect to the
            suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of a
            Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Units or the
            Exchange Units to be sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer for
            offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening
            of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any
            event, the existence of any condition of any information becoming
            known that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement
            or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
            incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
            that requires the making of any changes in, or amendments or
            supplements to, such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents
            so that, in the case of the Registration Statement and the
            Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
            fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
            therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
            circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (vi) of
            any reasonable determination by the Issuers or any Subsidiary
            Guarantor that a post-effective amendment to a Registration
            Statement would be appropriate and (vii) of any request by the SEC
            for amendments to the Registration Statement or supplements to the
            Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto.

      (f)   Use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
            order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of
            any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or
            suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of
            any of the Registrable Units or the Exchange Units to be sold by any
            Participating Broker-Dealer, for sale in any jurisdiction, and, if
            any such order is issued, to use their reasonable best efforts to
            obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible
            date.

      (g)   If (A) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, (B) a
            Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed
            pursuant to Section 2 is required to be delivered under the
            Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell
            Exchange Units during the Applicable Period or (C) reasonably
            requested in writing by the managing underwriters, if any, or the

<PAGE>

            Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
            Registrable Units being sold in connection with an underwritten
            offering, (i) promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or
            post-effective amendment such information or revisions to
            information therein relating to such underwriters or selling Holders
            as the managing underwriters, if any, or such Holders or any of
            their respective counsel reasonably request in writing to be
            included or made therein, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuers
            and (ii) make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or
            such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the
            Issuers have received notification of the matters to be incorporated
            in such Prospectus supplements or post-effective amendment.

      (h)   Prior to any public offering of Registrable Units or any delivery of
            a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Registration Statement by any
            Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Units during
            the Applicable Period, use their reasonable best efforts to register
            or qualify, and to cooperate with the selling Holders of Registrable
            Units or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be,
            the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel in connection
            with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such
            registration or qualification) of such Registrable Units or Exchange
            Units, as the case may be, for offer and sale under the securities
            or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as
            any selling Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer or any managing
            underwriter or underwriters, if any, reasonably request in writing;
            provided that where Exchange Units held by Participating
            Broker-Dealers or Registrable Units are offered other than through
            an underwritten offering, the Issuers and each Subsidiary Guarantor
            agree to cause their counsel to perform Blue Sky investigations and
            use their reasonable best efforts to file any registrations and
            qualifications required to be filed pursuant to this Section 6(h),
            use their reasonable best efforts to keep each such registration or
            qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period
            such Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and use
            their reasonable best efforts to do any and all other acts or things
            reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such
            jurisdictions of the Exchange Units held by Participating
            Broker-Dealers or the Registrable Units covered by the applicable
            Registration Statement; provided that neither the Issuers nor any
            Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required to (A) qualify generally to
            do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified,
            (B) take any action that would subject it to general service of
            process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or
            (C) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is
            not then so subject.

            the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing

            Registrable Units to be in such denominations and registered in such
            names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or
            Holders may reasonably request.

      (j)   Use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Units
            covered by any Registration Statement to be registered with or
            approved by such governmental agencies or authorities as may be
            necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the
            underwriter, if any, to consummate the disposition of such
            Registrable Units, except as may be required solely as a consequence
            of the nature of such selling Holder's business, in which case the
            Issuers shall (and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to)
            cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such
            Registration Statement and the granting of such approvals; provided
            that neither the Issuers nor any existing Subsidiary Guarantor shall
            be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any
            jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (B) take any action
            that would subject it to general service of process in any
            jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or (C) subject itself
            to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so
            subject.

      (k)   If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2) a

            any event contemplated by paragraph 6(e)(v) or 6(e)(vi) hereof, as
            promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC, at the
            expense of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors , a supplement
            or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a
            supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or
            deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other

            of the Exchange Units to whom such Prospectus will be delivered by a
            Participating Broker-Dealer, such Prospectus will not contain an
            untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
            therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
            not misleading, and, if SEC review is required, use their reasonable
            best efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to be declared
            effective as soon as possible.

      (l)   Use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Units
            covered by a Registration Statement to be rated with such

            Registrable Units covered by such Registration Statement or the
            managing underwriter or underwriters, if any.

      (m)   Prior to the initial issuance of the Exchange Units, (i) provide the
            Trustee with one or more certificates for the Registrable Units in a

            may be appropriate in the circumstances, and such other matters as
            reasonably requested in writing by the underwriters; and (iv)
            deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably
            requested in writing by the Holders of a majority in aggregate
            principal amount of the Registrable Units being sold and the

            and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such
            selling Holder or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case
            may be, or underwriter (collectively, the "Inspectors"), at the
            offices where normally kept, during reasonable business hours and in
            a manner so as not to be disruptive to the business or operations of
            the Issuers and/or Subsidiary Guarantors, all financial and other
            records and pertinent corporate documents of the Issuers and their
            subsidiaries (collectively, the "Records") as shall be reasonably
            necessary to enable them to exercise any applicable due diligence
            responsibilities, and cause the officers, directors and employees of
            the Issuers and their subsidiaries to supply all information
            reasonably requested in writing by any such Inspector in connection
            with such Registration Statement. Each Inspector shall agree in
            writing, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuers, that it
            will keep the Records confidential and not disclose any of the
            Records unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to
            avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such Registration
            Statement, (ii) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a
            subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction,
            (iii) the information in such Records is public or has been made
            generally available to the public other than as a result of a
            disclosure or failure to safeguard by such Inspector or (iv)

            of counsel for any Inspector, necessary or advisable in connection

            of, based upon, related to, or involving this Agreement, or any
            transaction contemplated hereby or arising hereunder. Each selling
            Holder of such Registrable Units and each such Participating
            Broker-Dealer will be required to agree that information obtained by
            it as a result of such inspections shall be deemed confidential and
            shall not be used by it as the basis for any market transactions in
            the securities of the Issuers unless and until such is made
            generally available to the public. Each Inspector, each selling
            Holder of such Registrable Units and each such Participating
            Broker-Dealer will be required to further agree that it will, upon
            learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of
            competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Issuers and, to the
            extent practicable, use their best efforts to allow the Issuers, at
            their expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure
            of the Records deemed confidential at their expense.

      (p)   Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make
            generally available to the security holders of the Issuers with
            regard to any Applicable Registration Statement earning statements

            Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the
            Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month
            period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such
            period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal
            quarter in which

<PAGE>

            Registrable Units are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or
            best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to
            underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of the
            first fiscal quarter of the Issuers after the effective date of a
            Registration Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month
            periods.

      (q)   Upon consummation of an Exchange Offer or Private Exchange, use
            reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of counsel to the
            Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors (in form, scope and substance
            reasonably satisfactory to the Initial Purchaser), addressed to the
            Trustee for the benefit of all Holders participating in the Exchange
            Offer or Private Exchange, as the case may be, to the effect that
            (i) the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors have duly authorized,
            executed and delivered the Exchange Units or the Private Exchange
            Units, as the case may be, and the Indenture, (ii) the Exchange
            Units or the Private Exchange Units, as the case may be, and the
            Indenture constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
            Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, enforceable against the
            Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors in accordance with their
            respective terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to
            customary United States and foreign exceptions and (iii) all
            obligations of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors under the
            Exchange Units or the Private Exchange Units, as the case may be,
            and the Indenture are secured by Liens (as defined in the Indenture)
            on the assets securing the obligations of the Issuers and the
            Subsidiary Guarantors under the Units, Indenture and Collateral
            Agreements subject to customary assumptions, reliances, exceptions
            and exclusions.

      (r)   If the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated,
            upon delivery of the Registrable Units by the Holders to the Issuers
            and the Subsidiary Guarantors (or to such other Person as directed
            by the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors) in exchange for the
            Exchange Units or the Private Exchange Units, as the case may be,
            the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall mark, or caused to
            be marked, on such Registrable Units that the Exchange Units or the
            Private Exchange Units, as the case may be, are being issued as
            substitute evidence of the indebtedness originally evidenced by the
            Registrable Units; provided that in no event shall such Registrable
            Units be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied.

      (s)   Cooperate with each seller of Registrable Units covered by any
            Registration Statement and each underwriter, if any, participating
            in the disposition of such Registrable Units and their respective
            counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the
            NASD.

      (t)   Use their reasonable best efforts to take all other steps reasonably
            necessary to effect the registration of the Registrable Units
            covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby.

      (u)   The Issuers may require each seller of Registrable Units or
            Participating Broker-Dealer as to which any registration is being
            effected to furnish to the Issuers such information regarding such
            seller or Participating Broker-Dealer and the

<PAGE>

            distribution of such Registrable Units as the Issuers may, from time
            to time, reasonably request in writing. The Issuers may exclude from
            such registration the Registrable Units of any seller who fails to
            furnish such information within a reasonable time (which time in no
            event shall exceed 15 days) after receiving such request. Each
            seller of Registrable Units or Participating Broker-Dealer as to
            which any registration is being effected agrees to furnish promptly
            to the Issuers all information required to be disclosed in order to
            make the information previously furnished by such seller not
            materially misleading.

      (v)   Each Holder of Registrable Units and each Participating
            Broker-Dealer agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Units or
            Exchange Units to be sold by such Participating Broker-Dealer, as
            the case may be, that, upon receipt of any notice from the Issuers
            of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section
            6(e)(ii), 6(e)(iv), 6(e)(v), or 6(e)(vi), such Holder will forthwith
            discontinue disposition of such Registrable Units covered by a
            Registration Statement and such Participating Broker-Dealer will
            forthwith discontinue disposition of such Exchange Units pursuant to
            any Prospectus and, in each case, forthwith discontinue
            dissemination of such Prospectus until such Holder's or
            Participating Broker-Dealer's receipt of the copies of the
            supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(k), or
            until it is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Issuers that
            the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has
            received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto and, if so
            directed by the Issuers, such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer,
            as the case may be, will deliver to the Issuers all copies, other
            than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's or Participating
            Broker-Dealer's possession, of the Prospectus covering such
            Registrable Units current at the time of the receipt of such notice.
            In the event the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall give
            any such notice, the Applicable Period shall be extended by the
            number of days during such periods from and including the date of
            the giving of such notice to and including the date when each
            Participating Broker-Dealer shall have received (x) the copies of
            the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(k)
            or (y) the Advice.

            expenses of all other Persons retained by the Issuers and the
            Subsidiary Guarantors, (ix) fees and expenses of any "qualified
            independent underwriter" or other independent appraiser
            participating in an offering pursuant to Section 3 of Schedule E to
            the By-laws of the NASD, but only where the need for such a
            "qualified independent underwriter" arises due to a relationship
            with the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, (x) internal
            expenses of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors (including,
            without limitation, all salaries and expenses of officers and
            employees of the Issuers or the Subsidiary Guarantors performing
            legal or accounting duties), (xi) the expense of any annual audit,
            (xii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Exchange Agent
            and (xiii) the expenses relating to printing, word processing and
            distributing all Registration Statements, underwriting agreements,
            securities sales agreements, indentures and any other documents
            necessary in order to comply with this Agreement.

      (b)   The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall reimburse the
            Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than
            one counsel chosen by the Holders of a majority in aggregate
            principal amount of the Registrable Units to be included in any
            Registration Statement. The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors
            shall pay all documentary, stamp, transfer or other transactional
            taxes attributable to the issuance or delivery of the Exchange Units
            or Private Exchange Units in exchange for the Units; provided that
            the Issuers shall not be required to pay taxes payable in respect of
            any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of any Exchange
            Unit or Private Exchange Unit in a name other than that of the
            Holder of the Unit in respect of which such Exchange Unit or Private
            Exchange Unit is being issued. The Issuers and the Subsidiary
            Guarantors shall reimburse the Holders for fees and expenses
            (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Holders)
            relating to any enforcement of any rights of the Holders under this
            Agreement.

8.    INDEMNIFICATION

      (a)   Indemnification by the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The
            Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to
            indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Units,
            Exchange Units or Private Exchange Units and each Participating
            Broker-Dealer selling Exchange Units during the Applicable Period,
            each Person, if any, who controls each such Holder (within the

<PAGE>

            meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the
            Exchange Act) and the officers, directors and partners of each such
            Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer and controlling person, to the
            fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims,
            damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation,
            reasonable costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees as
            provided in this Section 8) and expenses (including, without
            limitation, reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
            with investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending against any of
            the foregoing) (collectively, "Losses"), as incurred, insofar as
            such Losses arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged
            untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
            Statement, Prospectus or form of prospectus, or in any amendment or
            supplement thereto, or in any preliminary prospectus, or any
            omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
            required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
            therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
            not misleading, except insofar as such Losses are solely based upon
            information relating to such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer
            and furnished in writing to the Issuers and the Subsidiary
            Guarantors (or reviewed and approved in writing) by such Holder or
            Participating Broker-Dealer or their counsel expressly for use
            therein; provided, however, that the Issuers and the Subsidiary
            Guarantors will not be liable to any Indemnified Party (as defined
            below) under this Section 8 to the extent Losses were solely caused
            by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
            omission that was contained or made in any preliminary prospectus
            and corrected in the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
            thereto if (i) the Prospectus does not contain any other untrue
            statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a
            material fact that was the subject matter of the related proceeding,
            (ii) any such Losses resulted from an action, claim or suit by any
            Person who purchased Registrable Units or Exchange Units which are
            the subject thereof from such Indemnified Party and (iii) it is
            established in the related proceeding that such Indemnified Party
            failed to deliver or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or
            supplemented) to such Person with or prior to the confirmation of
            the sale of such Registrable Units or Exchange Units sold to such
            Person if required by applicable law, unless such failure to deliver
            or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) was
            a result of noncompliance by the Issuers with Section 6 of this
            Agreement. The Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors also agree to
            indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar
            securities industry professionals participating in the distribution,
            their officers, directors, agents and employees and each Person who
            controls such Persons (within the meaning of Section 5 of the
            Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act) to the same
            extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
            Holders or the Participating Broker-Dealer.

      (b)   Indemnification by Holder. In connection with any Registration
            Statement, Prospectus or form of prospectus, any amendment or
            supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus in which a Holder
            is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Issuers and the
            Subsidiary Guarantors in writing such information as the Issuers and
            the Subsidiary Guarantors reasonably request for use in

<PAGE>

            connection with any Registration Statement, Prospectus or form of
            prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary
            prospectus and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, the
            Subsidiary Guarantors, their respective directors and each Person,
            if any, who controls the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors
            (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section
            20(a) of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers and partners
            of such controlling persons, to the fullest extent lawful, from and
            against all Losses insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based
            upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
            contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or form of
            prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
            preliminary prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state
            therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
            to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
            under which they were made, not misleading to the extent, but only
            to the extent, that such losses are finally judicially determined by
            a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, unappealable order to
            have resulted solely from an untrue statement or alleged untrue
            statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a
            material fact contained in or omitted from any information so
            furnished in writing by such Holder to the Issuers and the
            Subsidiary Guarantors expressly for use therein. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, in no event shall the liability of any selling Holder be
            greater in amount than such Holder's Maximum Contribution Amount (as
            defined below).

      (c)   Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any proceeding shall be
            brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity
            hereunder (an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall
            promptly notify the party or parties from which such indemnity is
            sought (the "Indemnifying Party" or "Indemnifying Parties", as
            applicable) in writing; provided, that the failure to so notify the
            Indemnifying Parties shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from
            any obligation or liability except to the extent (but only to the
            extent) that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
            jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that the
            Indemnifying Parties have been prejudiced materially by such
            failure.

      The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written
notice to an Indemnified Party, within 20 Business Days after receipt of written
notice from such Indemnified Party of such proceeding, to assume, at its
expense, the defense of any such proceeding, provided, that an Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or parties unless: (1) the
Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such
proceeding or shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party; or (3) the named parties to any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party or any of its affiliates or controlling persons, and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or
more defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are in addition to, or in
conflict with, those defenses available to the Indemnifying Party or such
affiliate or controlling person (in which case, if such Indemnified

<PAGE>

Party notifies the Indemnifying Parties in writing that it elects to employ
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not have the right to assume the defense and the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party;
it being understood, however, that, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in
connection with any one such proceeding or separate but substantially similar or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any
time for such Indemnified Party).

      No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement of any such
proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final
judgment for the plaintiff in any such proceeding, each Indemnifying Party
jointly and severally agrees, subject to the exceptions and limitations set
forth above, to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and
against any and all Losses by reason of such settlement or judgment. The
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability
in respect of such proceeding for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled
to indemnification hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party
thereto).

      (d)   Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8
            is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold
            such Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses in respect of which
            this Section 8 would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by
            reason of exceptions provided in this Section 8), then each
            applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
            Indemnified Party, shall have a joint and several obligation to
            contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party
            as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to
            reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one
            hand, and such Indemnified Party, on the other hand, in connection
            with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such
            Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
            relative fault of such Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and
            Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be determined by
            reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged
            untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
            to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such
            Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative
            intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
            or prevent any such statement or omission. The amount paid or
            payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any Losses shall be
            deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by
            such party in connection with any proceeding, to the extent such
            party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the
            indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) was available
            to such party.

      The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding

<PAGE>

paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), a selling Holder
shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of
such Holder's Maximum Contribution Amount. A selling Holder's "Maximum
Contribution Amount" shall equal the excess of (i) the aggregate proceeds
received by such Holder pursuant to the sale of such Registrable Units or
Exchange Units over (ii) the aggregate amount of damages that such Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to
this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount
of the Registrable Securities held by each Holder hereunder and not joint. The
Issuers' and Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations to contribute pursuant to this
Section 8(d) are joint and several.

      The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 are
in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the
Indemnified Parties.

9.    RULES 144 AND 144A

      The Issuers covenant that they shall (a) file the reports required to be
filed by them (if so required) under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in
a timely manner and, if at any time the Issuers are not required to file such
reports, they will, upon the written request of any Holder of Registrable Units,
make publicly available other information necessary to permit sales pursuant to
Rule 144 and 144A and (b) take such further action as any Holder may reasonably
request in writing, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such
Holder to sell Registrable Units without registration under the Securities Act
pursuant to the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A. Upon the request
of any Holder, the Issuers shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as
to whether they have complied with such information and requirements.

10.   UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS OF REGISTRABLE UNITS

      If any of the Registrable Units covered by any Shelf Registration is to be
sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers
and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable Units
included in such offering; provided, however, that such investment banker or
investment bankers and manager or managers must be reasonably acceptable to the
Issuers.

      No Holder of Registrable Units may participate in any underwritten
registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's
Registrable Units on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements
approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b)
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.

<PAGE>

11.   SEPARATION EVENT

      If a Separation Event occurs at any time prior to the consummation of the
Exchange Offer of the Units pursuant to this Agreement, all terms and conditions
set forth under this Agreement shall apply to each of the U.S. Notes and Dutch
Notes (as independent securities) and each of the defined terms "U.S. Notes" and
the "Dutch Notes" shall replace "Units" where appropriate and applicable so that
the U.S. Notes and Dutch Notes shall have the same rights and obligations under
this Agreement as the Units had under this Agreement prior to the occurrence of
such Separation Event.

12.   MISCELLANEOUS

      (a)   Remedies. In the event of a breach by either the Issuers or any of
            the Subsidiary Guarantors of any of their respective obligations
            under this Agreement, each Holder, in addition to being entitled to
            exercise all rights provided herein, in the Indenture or, in the
            case of the Initial Purchaser, in the Purchase Agreement, or granted
            by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific
            performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Issuers and the
            Subsidiary Guarantors agree that monetary damages would not be
            adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by
            either the Issuers or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of any of the
            provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agree that, in the
            event of any action for specific performance in respect of such
            breach, the Issuers shall (and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor
            to) waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

      (b)   No Inconsistent Agreements. The Issuers and each of the Subsidiary
            Guarantors have not entered, as of the date hereof, and the Issuers
            and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not enter, after the
            date of this Agreement, into any agreement with respect to any of
            its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the
            Holders of Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with
            the provisions hereof. The Issuers and each of the Subsidiary
            Guarantors have not entered and will not enter into any agreement
            with respect to any of their securities that will grant to any
            Person piggy-back rights with respect to a Registration Statement.

      (c)   Adjustments Affecting Registrable Units. The Issuers shall not,
            directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the
            Registrable Units as a class that would adversely affect the ability
            of the Holders to include such Registrable Units in a registration
            undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

      (d)   Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be
            amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to
            departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, otherwise
            than with the prior written consent of the Holders of not less than
            a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
            Registrable Units in circumstances that would adversely affect any
            Holders of Registrable Units; provided, however, that Section 8 and
            this Section 12(d) may not be amended, modified or supplemented
            without the

<PAGE>

            prior written consent of each Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with
            respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of
            Holders of Registrable Units whose securities are being tendered
            pursuant to the Exchange Offer or sold pursuant to a Units
            Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly
            affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders of
            Registrable Units may be given by Holders of at least a majority in
            aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Units being tendered
            or being sold by such Holders pursuant to such Units Registration
            Statement.

      (e)   Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or
            permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery,
