Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

         On December 21, 2004, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ("KCI" or the "Company")
entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to
the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment") with Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc. as administrative agent for the lenders and JPMorgan
Securities Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole book manager for the Amendment.
The Amendment amends our existing Credit Agreement dated August 11, 2003 (as
previously amended, the "Credit Agreement"). The Amendment includes the
following changes (among other changes):

o    There is a new B2 term loan facility in the original principal amount of
     $352.6 million, the proceeds of which were used to pay off all amounts
     owed under the previously-existing B1 term loan facility. The applicable
     margin with respect to the new B2 term loan facility is (a) at any time
     that the leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is greater
     than 2.25 to 1.00, 1.00% in the case of base rate loans and 2.00% in the
     case of Eurodollar loans, (b) at any time that the leverage ratio is less
     than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00, 0.75% in the case of base rate loans and
     1.75% in the case of Eurodollar loans and (c) at any time that the
     leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.75 to 1.00 and the loans are
     rated at least (i) Ba1 by Moody's and BB by Standard and Poor's or (ii)
     Ba2 by Moody's and BB+ by Standard and Poor's, 0.50% in the case of base
     rate loans and 1.50% in the case of Eurodollar loans.

o    The limit on how much we are allowed to spend acquiring other businesses
     was increased to $100 million per fiscal year, with unused portions of
     that allowance being carried forward for up to three fiscal years.

o    The requirement that specified stockholders collectively hold at least
     20% of our voting stock was removed.

o    The limitation on any person or group acting together owning more of our
     voting stock than specified existing stockholders was replaced with a
     provision limiting to 50% the amount of our voting stock that may be
     owned by any person or group acting together (other than specified
     existing stockholders).

         The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment which is filed
herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.


Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
