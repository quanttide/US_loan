The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.

The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.

The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.

Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).

The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.

With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to
those persons who are market counterparties or intermediate customers (as
defined in the UK Financial Services Authority's rules).

The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.


The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.


The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.


Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).


The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.


With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to
those persons who are market counterparties or intermediate customers (as
defined in the UK Financial Services Authority's rules).

The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.


The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.


The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.


Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).


The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.


With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to
those persons who are market counterparties or intermediate customers (as
defined in the UK Financial Services Authority's rules).

The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.


The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.


The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.


Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).


The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.


With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to

The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.


The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.


The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.


Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).


The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.


With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to
those persons who are market counterparties or intermediate customers (as
defined in the UK Financial Services Authority's rules).

The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.


The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.


The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.


Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).


The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.


With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to
those persons who are market counterparties or intermediate customers (as
defined in the UK Financial Services Authority's rules).

The information herein has been prepared solely for informational purposes and
is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell
any security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. Any such
offer to buy or sell any security or instrument or to engage in a transaction
would be made only after a prospective participant had completed its own
independent investigation of the transaction and received all information it
required to make its own investment decision, including, where applicable, a
review of any offering circular or memorandum describing such security or
instrument which would contain material information not contained herein and
to which prospective participants are referred. In the event of any such
offering, this information shall be deemed superseded and replaced in its
entirety by such offering circular or memorandum. No representation or
warranty can be given with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein, or that any future offer of securities or transactions
would conform to the terms hereof. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates disclaim
any and all liability relating to this information.

The following information may contain general, summary discussions of certain
tax, regulatory, accounting and/or legal issues relevant to the proposed
transaction. Any such discussion is necessarily generic and may not be
applicable to or complete for any particular recipient's specific facts and
circumstances. Morgan Stanley is not offering and does not purport to offer
tax, regulatory, accounting or legal advice and this information should not
and cannot be relied upon as such. Prior to entering into any proposed
transaction, recipients should determine, in consultation with their own
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, the economic risks and merits,
as well as the legal, tax, regulatory and accounting characteristics and
consequences, of the transaction.

The projections or other estimates in these materials (if any), including
estimates of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements based upon
certain assumptions and are preliminary in nature. Actual results are
difficult to predict and may depend upon events outside the issuer's or
counterparty's control. Actual events may differ from those assumed and
changes to any assumptions may have a material impact on any projections or
estimates. Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may
significantly affect the analysis. Certain assumptions may have been made for
modeling purposes only to simplify the presentation and/or calculation of any
projections or estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not purport that any such
assumptions will reflect actual future events. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that estimated returns or projections will be realized or that
actual returns or performance results will not be materially different than
those estimated herein. Any such estimated returns and projections should be
viewed as hypothetical. Recipients should conduct their own analysis, using
such assumptions as they deem appropriate, and should fully consider other
available information in making a decision regarding these transactions. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Price and
availability are subject to change without notice.

Notwithstanding any other express or implied agreement, arrangement, or
understanding to the contrary, Morgan Stanley and each recipient hereof are
deemed to agree that both Morgan Stanley and such recipient (and their
respective employees, representatives, and other agents) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind from the commencement of
discussions, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction ("tax
treatment") and any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment of the transaction described herein ("tax structure") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except where confidentiality is reasonably necessary to comply with securities
laws (including, where applicable, confidentiality regarding the identity of
an issuer of securities or its affiliates, agents and advisors).

The offer or sale of securities or transactions may be restricted by law.
Additionally, transfers of any such securities or instruments may be limited
by law or the terms thereof. Unless noted herein, neither Morgan Stanley or
any issuer of securities has taken or will take any action in any jurisdiction
that would permit a public offering of Notes, or possession or distribution of
any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction
where action for such purpose is required. Recipients are required to inform
themselves of and comply with any legal or contractual restrictions on their
purchase, holding, sale, exercise of rights or performance of obligations
under any transaction. Morgan Stanley does not undertake or have any
responsibility to notify you of any changes to the attached information.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its affiliates and others associated with
it may have positions in, and may effect transactions in, securities and
instruments of issuers mentioned herein and may also perform or seek to
perform investment banking services for the issuers of such securities and
instruments. Additional information is available upon request.

With respect to any UK recipients, this communication is directed only to
those persons who are market counterparties or intermediate customers (as
defined in the UK Financial Services Authority's rules).
