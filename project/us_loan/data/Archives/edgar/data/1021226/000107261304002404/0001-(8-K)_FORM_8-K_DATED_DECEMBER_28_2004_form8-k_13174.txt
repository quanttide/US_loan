ITEM 3.02  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

         On December 28, 2004, we issued to a consultant (the "Consultant")
warrants to purchase up to 575,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share, as compensation for
services provided to us. The sale of these securities was made in reliance on
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as a sale of securities
not involving a public offering.

         Under the terms of the warrants, the Consultant may purchase, at any
time and from time-to-time after the vesting of the warrants, up to 575,000
shares of our common stock. On fourth of the warrants vested and became
exercisable upon the execution of the agreement. The remaining warrants shall
vest and become exercisable in accordance with the following schedule:

         Number of Warrants                      Vesting Date
         143,750                                 January 9, 2005
         143,750                                 January 24, 2005
         143,750                                 February 8, 2005

Any unexercised warrants shall expire on November 30, 2007.

         The warrants contain a cashless exercise provision, whereby the warrant
holder may, in lieu of cash payment of the aggregate exercise price of the
warrants being exercised, exchange additional warrants such that the aggregate
spread (i.e., the difference between the exercise price of the warrant and the
market price of our common stock on the date of exercise) of such shares equals
the aggregate exercise price of the shares to be purchased. In the event of a
cashless exercise, we would not receive any cash proceeds for the shares
purchased pursuant to such exercise.

         We have agreed to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement covering all shares of our
common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of these warrants. We have agreed
that we will file such registration statement with the SEC not later than
February 15, 2005, and that we will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the registration statement to become effective within sixty (60) days of the
date of filing.
