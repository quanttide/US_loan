ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

ITEM 3.02  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

         On December 16, 2004, we entered into an Agreement with Trilogy Capital
Partners, Inc. ("Trilogy"). Pursuant to that agreement, for a period of twelve
months, Trilogy will provide publicity and marketing services for us, and
perform the functions of an in-house Investor Relations Officer. In return we
are required to pay Trilogy a fee of $10,000.00 per month for each of the twelve
months of the agreement.

         As additional compensation, we issued to Trilogy warrants to purchase
up to 5,750,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an
exercise price of $0.01 per share. The sale of these securities was made in
reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as a sale of
securities not involving a public offering.

         Under the terms of the warrants, Trilogy may purchase, at any time and
from time-to-time after the vesting of the warrants, up to 5,750,000 shares of
our common stock. 1,437,500 of the warrants vested and became exercisable upon
the execution of the agreement. The remaining warrants shall vest and become
exercisable in accordance with the following schedule:

         Number of Warrants                                   Vesting Date
         ------------------                                   ------------
         1,437,500                                            January 9, 2005
         1,437,500                                            January 24, 2005
         1,437,500                                            February 8, 2005

Any unexercised warrants shall expire on November 30, 2007.

         The warrants contain a cashless exercise provision, whereby the warrant
holder may, in lieu of cash payment of the aggregate exercise price of the
warrants being exercised, exchange additional warrants such that the aggregate
spread (i.e., the difference between the exercise price of the warrant and the
market price of our common stock on the date of exercise) of such shares equals
the aggregate exercise price of the shares to be purchased. In the event of a
cashless exercise, we would not receive any cash proceeds for the shares
purchased pursuant to such exercise.

         We have agreed to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement covering all shares of our
common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of these warrants. We have agreed
that we will file such registration statement with the SEC not later than
February 15, 2005, and that we will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the registration statement to become effective within sixty (60) days of the
date of filing.
