Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     On December 27, 2004, the Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors
of the  Network  Engines,  Inc.  ("Network  Engines")  granted to the  following
executive  officers  stock  options  under its 1999  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  as
amended, to purchase the number of shares of common stock of Network Engines set
forth opposite their respective  names below.  Each option has an exercise price
equal to $2.76 per  share,  which is equal to the  closing  price of the  common
stock of Network  Engines on the  Nasdaq  National  Market on the date of grant.
Each option grant was evidenced by an option agreement substantially in the form
of the Form of Incentive Stock Option Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.3
to the Company's  registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-34286) and is
incorporated  herein by reference,  except that the vesting of the options shall
be as follows. The options vest as to 6.25% of the shares underlying each option
grant at the end of each successive full three-month  period following the grant
date  until the  fourth  anniversary  of the grant  date,  except  that for John
Amaral,  there  shall  be no  vesting  prior  to the  first  anniversary  of his
employment  with  Network  Engines,  on which date the  options  that would have
otherwise vested prior to the anniversary date will vest.
