<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Protective Life Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acquisitions
segment focuses on acquiring, converting, and servicing policies acquired from other
companies. The segment&#146;s primary focus is on life insurance policies sold to
individuals. These acquisitions may be accomplished through acquisitions of companies or
through the reinsurance of blocks of policies from other insurers. Forty-three
transactions have been closed by the segment since 1970, including 16 since 1989. Policies
acquired through the segment are usually administered as &#147;closed&#148; blocks; i.e.,
no new policies are being marketed. Therefore, the amount of insurance in force for a
particular acquisition is expected to decline with time due to lapses and deaths of the
insureds. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
acquisitions closed by the Acquisitions segment do not include the acquisition of an

Company generally either ceased future marketing efforts or redirected those efforts to

contracts which specify a return on deposits for a specified period and often provide
flexibility for withdrawals at book value in keeping with the benefits provided by the
plan. The demand for GICs is related to the relative attractiveness of the &#147;fixed

options available to plan participants. </FONT></P>

segment also markets fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees
of municipal bond proceeds, institutional investors, bank trust departments and money
market funds, and sells funding agreements to special purpose entities that in turn issue
notes or certificates in smaller, transferable denominations. During the fourth quarter of
2003, the Company registered a funding agreement-backed notes program with the SEC.
Through this program, the Company is able to offer notes to both institutional and retail
investors. The segment&#146;s funding agreement-backed notes complement the Company&#146;s
overall asset-liability management in that the terms of the funding agreements may be
tailored to the needs of the seller, as opposed to the needs of the buyer, and more so in
a retail program. The segment had sales of $450 million under this program in 2003. </FONT></P>

significant portion of the Company&#146;s bond portfolio is invested in mortgage-backed
securities. Mortgage-backed securities are constructed from pools of residential
mortgages, and may have cash flow volatility as a result of changes in the rate at which
prepayments of principal occur with respect to the underlying loans. Prepayments of
principal on the underlying residential loans can be expected to accelerate with decreases
in interest rates and diminish with increases in interest rates. The Company has not
invested in the higher risk tranches of mortgage-backed securities (except mortgage-backed
securities issued in securitization transactions sponsored by the Company). In addition,
the Company has entered into hedging transactions to reduce the volatility in market value
of its mortgage-backed securities. </FONT></P>

payments in the first five years, after which NAS receive an increasing percentage of pro
rata principal payments until the tenth year, after which NAS receive principal as

may be unsecured or subordinated to other creditors. Additionally, there is often a thinly
traded market for such securities and current market quotations are frequently not
available for some of these securities. Issuers of less than investment grade debt
obligations usually have higher levels of indebtedness and are more sensitive to adverse
economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment-grade
issuers. </FONT></P>

Company also invests a significant portion of its portfolio in mortgage loans. Results for
these investments have been excellent due to careful management and a focus on a
specialized segment of the market. The Company generally does not lend on speculative
properties and has specialized in making loans on either credit-oriented commercial
properties or credit-anchored strip shopping centers. The average size of loans made
during 2003 was $3.1 million. The average size mortgage loan in the Company&#146;s
portfolio is approximately $2.2 million. The largest single loan amount is $19.6 million. </FONT></P>

loans are generally on strip shopping centers anchored by one or more regional or national
retail stores. The anchor tenants enter into long-term leases with the Company&#146;s
borrowers. These centers provide the basic necessities of life, such as food,
pharmaceuticals, and clothing, and have been relatively insensitive to changes in economic
conditions. The following are the largest anchor tenants (measured by the Company&#146;s

Company&#146;s mortgage lending criteria generally require that the loan-to-value ratio on
each mortgage be at or under 75% at the time of origination. Projected rental payments
from credit anchors (i.e., excluding rental payments from smaller local tenants) generally
exceed 70% of the property&#146;s projected operating expenses and debt service. The
Company also offers a commercial loan product under which the Company will permit a
loan-to-value ratio of up to 85% in exchange for a participating interest in the cash
flows from the underlying real estate. Approximately $382.7 million of the Company&#146;s
mortgage loans have this participation feature. </FONT></P>

of the Company&#146;s mortgage loans have call or interest rate reset provisions between 3
and 10 years. However, if interest rates were to significantly increase, the Company may
be unable to call the loans or increase the interest rates on its existing mortgage loans
commensurate with the significantly increased market rates. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003, $11.8 million or 0.4% of the mortgage loan portfolio was nonperforming.
It is the Company&#146;s policy to cease to carry accrued interest on loans that are over
90 days delinquent. For loans less than 90 days delinquent, interest is accrued unless it
is determined that the accrued interest is not collectible. If a loan becomes over 90 days
delinquent, it is the Company&#146;s general policy to initiate foreclosure proceedings
unless a workout arrangement to bring the loan current is in place. </FONT></P>

1996, the Company sold approximately $554 million of its mortgage loans in a
securitization transaction. In 1997, the Company sold approximately $445 million of its
loans in a second securitization transaction. In 1998 the Company securitized $146 million
of its mortgage loans and in 1999 the Company securitized $263 million. The
securitizations&#146; senior tranches were sold, and the Company retained the junior
tranches. The Company continues to service the securitized mortgage loans. At December 31,
2003, the Company had investments related to retained beneficial interests of mortgage
loan securitizations of $283.6 million. </FONT></P>

a general rule, the Company does not invest directly in real estate. The investment real
estate held by the Company consists largely of properties obtained through foreclosures or
the acquisition of other insurance companies. In the Company&#146;s experience, the
appraised value of a foreclosed property often approximates the mortgage loan balance on
the property plus costs of foreclosure. Also, foreclosed properties often generate a
positive cash flow enabling the Company to hold and manage the property until the property
can be profitably sold. </FONT></P>

medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued as applied for, rated,
or rejected. Medical examinations of applicants are required for individual life insurance
in excess of certain prescribed amounts (which vary based on the type of insurance) and
for most individual insurance applied for by applicants over age 50. In the case of
&#147;simplified issue&#148; policies, which are issued primarily through the Asset
Protection segment and the Life Marketing segment in the payroll deduction market,
coverage is rejected if the responses to certain health questions contained in the
application indicate adverse health of the applicant. For other than &#147;simplified
issue&#148; policies, medical examinations are requested of any applicant, regardless of
age and amount of requested coverage, if an examination is deemed necessary to underwrite
the risk. Substandard risks may be referred to reinsurers for full or partial reinsurance
of the substandard risk. </FONT></P>

insurance applications above certain face amounts ranging from $100,000 to $250,000 based
on the applicant&#146;s age, except in the worksite and BOLI markets where no blood
testing is required. Blood samples are tested for a wide range of chemical values and are
screened for antibodies to the HIV virus. Applications also contain questions permitted by
law regarding the HIV virus which must be answered by the proposed insureds. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries cede insurance to other insurance companies. The
ceding insurance company remains liable with respect to ceded insurance should any
reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed by it. The Company sets a limit on the
amount of insurance retained on the life of any one person. In the individual lines it
will not retain more than $500,000, including accidental death benefits, on any one life.
In many cases the retention is less. At December 31, 2003, the Company had insurance in
force of $346.5 billion of which approximately $292.7 billion was ceded to reinsurers. </FONT></P>

premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates,

policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the liabilities
shall not be less than liabilities calculated using certain named mortality tables and

policy liabilities and accruals carried in the Company&#146;s financial reports presented
on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP) differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the
insurance subsidiaries&#146; statutory financial statements (presented on the basis of
statutory accounting principles mandated by state insurance regulations). For policy
liabilities other than those for universal life policies, annuity contracts, GICs, and
funding agreements, these differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables
and interest rate assumptions which are deemed to be more appropriate for financial
reporting purposes than those required for statutory accounting purposes; from the
introduction of lapse assumptions into the calculation; and from the use of the net level
premium method on all business. Policy liabilities for universal life policies, annuity
contracts, GICs, and funding agreements are carried in the Company&#146;s financial
reports at the account value of the policy or contract plus accrued interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing
federal laws and regulations affect the taxation of the Company&#146;s products. Income
tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation
period of certain life insurance and annuity products. Congress has from time to time
considered proposals that, if enacted, would have had an adverse impact on the federal
income tax treatment of such products, or would increase the tax-deferred status of
competing products. In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate tax
obligations. Legislation has recently been enacted that would over time, reduce and
eventually eliminate the estate tax. If the estate tax is significantly reduced or
eliminated, the demand for certain life insurance products could be adversely affected.
The Company cannot predict what tax initiatives may be enacted which could adversely
affect the Company. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are taxed by the federal government in a manner
similar to companies in other industries. However, certain restrictions on consolidating
recently acquired life insurance companies and on consolidating life insurance company
income with non-insurance income are applicable to the Company; thus, the Company is not
able to consolidate all of the operating results of its subsidiaries for federal income
tax purposes. </FONT></P>

pre-1984 tax law, certain income of the Company was not taxed currently, but was
accumulated in a memorandum account designated as &#147;Policyholders&#146; Surplus&#148;
to be taxed only when such income was distributed to share owners or when certain limits
on accumulated amounts were exceeded. Consistent with current tax law, amounts accumulated
in Policyholders&#146; Surplus have been carried forward, although no accumulated income
may be added to these accounts. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate accumulation in the
Policyholders&#146; Surplus account was $70.5 million. Under current income tax laws, the

and health insurance is a mature industry. In recent years, the industry has experienced
little growth in life insurance sales, though the aging population has increased the
demand for retirement savings products. Life and health insurance is a highly competitive
industry. The Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business from
other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources than the

life insurance company&#146;s statutory capital is computed according to rules prescribed
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as modified by the insurance
company&#146;s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and
are intended to reflect a more conservative view; for example, requiring immediate
expensing of policy acquisition costs and through the use of more conservative
computations of policy liabilities. The NAIC&#146;s risk-based capital requirements
require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based capital
formula. These requirements are intended to allow insurance regulators to identify
inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks
inherent in the insurer&#146;s operations. The formula includes components for asset risk,
liability risk, interest rate exposure, and other factors. Based upon the December 31,
2003 statutory financial reports, the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are adequately
capitalized under the formula. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual reports with
the supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business and their
business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. Under the
rules of the NAIC, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to
five years) by one or more of the supervisory agencies on behalf of the states in which
they do business. To date, no such insurance department examinations have produced any
significant adverse findings regarding any insurance company subsidiary of the Company. </FONT></P>

insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business in such a
state can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by
insolvent or failed insurance companies. Although the Company cannot predict the amount of
any future assessments, most insurance guaranty fund laws currently provide that an
assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer&#146;s financial
strength. The Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries were assessed immaterial amounts in
2003, which will be partially offset by credits against future state premium taxes. </FONT></P>

addition, many states, including the states in which the Company&#146;s insurance
subsidiaries are domiciled, have enacted legislation or adopted regulations regarding
insurance holding company systems. These laws require registration of and periodic
reporting by insurance companies domiciled within the jurisdiction which control or are
controlled by other corporations or persons so as to constitute an insurance holding
company system. These laws also affect the acquisition of control of insurance companies
as well as transactions between insurance companies and companies controlling them. Most
states, including Tennessee, where Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective Life) is
domiciled, require administrative approval of the acquisition of control of an insurance
company domiciled in the state or the acquisition of control of an insurance holding
company whose insurance subsidiary is incorporated in the state. In Tennessee, the
acquisition of 10% of the voting securities of an entity is generally deemed to be the
acquisition of control for the purpose of the insurance holding company statute and
requires not only the filing of detailed information concerning the acquiring parties and
the plan of acquisition, but also administrative approval prior to the acquisition. </FONT></P>

Protective Life Corporation. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered
ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts are subject
to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. The maximum amount
that would qualify as ordinary dividends to Protective Life Corporation by Protective Life
in 2004 is estimated to be $293.8 million. No assurance can be given that more stringent
restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which the Company&#146;s

Life Corporation (the Company) is a holding company whose subsidiaries provide financial
services through the production, distribution, and administration of insurance and
investment products. The Company operates five business segments. An operating segment is
generally distinguished by products and/or channels of distribution. The Company&#146;s
operating segments are Life Marketing, Acquisitions, Annuities, Stable Value Products, and
Asset Protection. In addition, the Company has another segment referred to as the
Corporate and Other segment. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2003, the Company&#146;s net income increased 22.4% to $217.1 million or $3.07 per diluted
share, compared to $177.4 million or $2.52 per share in 2002. Included in 2003 net income
were net realized investment gains of $0.28 per share compared to gains of $0.04 per share
in 2002. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $159.2 million in 2003, an
increase of 26.8% over the $125.6 million reported in 2002. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in business-in-force. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Acquisitions segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $95.2 million in 2003, up slightly
from the $95.1 million reported in 2002. Increased earnings from recently completed
transactions were offset by the expected declining earnings from older acquired blocks of
business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Annuities segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $13.4 million in 2003, a decline of
$2.3 million from the $15.7 million reported in 2002. The decrease is primarily due to
interest spread compression and low sales of fixed annuities caused by lower interest
rates in 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Asset Protection segment had pretax operating income of $20.2 million in 2003, compared to
a loss of $14.8&nbsp;million in 2002. Results for the segment improved after a $25.6
million pretax charge in 2002. </FONT></P>

and Other had a pretax operating loss of $32.0 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $2.9
million in 2002. The loss in 2003 was a result of charges recorded of $28.4 million due to
negative trends in used vehicle prices affecting the segment&#146;s residual value
product. In addition, a $3.0&nbsp;million increase in interest expense contributed to this
decline. </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s accounting policies inherently require the use of judgments relating to a
variety of assumptions and estimates, in particular expectations of current and future
mortality, morbidity, persistency, expenses, and interest rates. Because of the inherent
uncertainty when using the assumptions and estimates, the effect of certain accounting
policies under different conditions or assumptions could be materially different from
those reported in the consolidated financial statements. A discussion of the various
critical accounting policies is presented below. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new insurance business.
These costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business
and coinsurance of blocks of policies, are deferred. The recovery of such costs is
dependent on the future profitability of the related policies. The amount of future profit
is dependent principally on investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and
expenses to administer the business and certain economic variables, such as inflation.
These factors enter into management&#146;s estimates of future profits which generally are
used to amortize certain of such costs. Accounting for other intangible assets such as
goodwill also requires an estimate of the future profitability of the associated lines of
business. Revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the
reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the
asset and a charge to income if estimated future profits are less than the unamortized
deferred amounts. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has a deferred policy acquisition costs asset of approximately $99.7 million
related to its variable annuity product line with an account balance of $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. The Company monitors the rate of amortization of the deferred policy
acquisition costs associated with its variable annuity product line. The methodologies
employ varying assumptions about how much and how quickly the stock markets will
appreciate. The primary assumptions used to project future profits as part of the analysis
include: a long-term equity market growth rate of 9%, reversion to the mean methodology
with a reversion to the mean cap rate of 14%, reversion to the mean period of 5 years, and
an amortization period of 20 years. A recovery in equity markets, or methodologies and
assumptions that anticipate a recovery, results in lower amounts of amortization, and a
worsening of equity markets results in higher amounts of amortization. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing
an adequate liability for the Company&#146;s obligations to its policyholders requires the
use of assumptions. Liabilities for future policy benefits on traditional life insurance
products require the use of assumptions relative to future investment yields, mortality,
persistency and other assumptions based on the Company&#146;s historical experience,
modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible
adverse deviation. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company also establishes liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) on its
variable annuity products. The methods used to estimate the liabilities employ assumptions
about mortality and the performance of equity markets. The Company assumes mortality of
60% of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 1994 Variable Annuity GMDB
Mortality Table to reflect improvements in mortality since the table was derived and other
factors. Future declines in the equity market would increase the Company&#146;s GMDB
liability. Differences between the actual experience and the assumptions used result in
variances in profit and could result in losses. The Company&#146;s GMDB at December 31,
2003, are subject to a dollar-for-dollar reduction upon withdrawal of related annuity
deposits on contracts issued prior to January&nbsp;1, 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining
whether a decline in the current fair value of invested assets is an other-than-temporary
decline in value can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates, particularly for
investments that are not actively traded in established markets. For example, assessing
the value of certain investments requires the Company to perform an analysis of expected
future cash flows or rates of prepayments. Other investments, such as collateralized
mortgage or bond obligations, represent selected tranches of a structured transaction,
supported overall by underlying investments in a wide variety of issuers. The
Company&#146;s specific accounting policies related to its invested assets are discussed
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company utilizes derivative transactions primarily in order to reduce its exposure to
interest rate risk as well as currency exchange risk. Assessing the effectiveness of these
hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often
involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. The Company employs a variety of methods
for determining the fair value of its derivative instruments. The fair values of interest
rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, total return swaps and put or call options are based
upon industry standard models which present-value the projected cash flows of the
derivatives using current and implied future market conditions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining
the Company&#146;s obligations to employees under its defined benefit pension plan and
stock-based compensation plans requires the use of estimates. The calculation of the
liability related to the Company&#146;s defined benefit pension plan requires assumptions
regarding the appropriate weighted average discount rate, estimated rate of increase in
the compensation of its employees and the expected long-term rate of return on the
plan&#146;s assets. Accounting for other stock-based compensation plans may require the
use of option pricing models to estimate the Company&#146;s obligations. Assumptions used
in such models relate to equity market volatility, the risk-free interest rate at the date
of grant, as well as the expected exercise date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

estimates after consultation with its advisors and a review of available facts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums
and policy fees were $810.3 million in 2002, an increase of $191.7 million, or 31.0% from
the $618.7&nbsp;million reported for 2001. During 2002, the Company discovered that it had
overpaid the reinsurance premiums due on certain life insurance policies over a period of
10 years. The Company recorded cash and receivables totaling $69.7&nbsp;million, and a
corresponding increase in premiums and policy fees, which reflected its then current
estimate of amounts to be recovered. Excluding this increase, premiums and policy fees in
the Life Marketing segment increased $29.5 million due to an increase in sales. Premiums
and policy fees in the Acquisitions segment are expected to decline with time (due to the
lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or terminations of coverage) unless
new acquisitions are made. In June 2002, the Company coinsured a block of insurance
policies from Conseco Variable Insurance Company (Conseco). This transaction resulted in
an increase in premiums and policy fees of $18.8 million. The acquisition of Inter-State
and First Variable resulted in a $27.0 million increase in premiums and policy fees.
Premiums and policy fees from older acquired blocks decreased $3.7 million. Premiums and
policy fees from the Annuities segment declined $2.3 million due to a decline in variable
annuity management fees caused by the general decline in the equity markets. Premiums and
policy fees related to the Asset Protection segment increased $49.9 million due to
continued higher sales in its service contracts lines. Lower sales in
other Asset Protection lines during 2002 were more than offset by a decline in the amount
of reinsurance ceded. The decline in reinsurance ceded was primarily due to a change in
the form of a credit reinsurance agreement in 2002. Premiums and policy fees relating to
various lines in the Corporate and Other segment increased $2.9 million. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums
and policy fees were $735.9 million in 2003, a decrease of $74.4 million or 9.2% from 2002
premiums and policy fees. In 2003, the Company substantially completed its recovery of all
of the previously mentioned reinsurance overpayments. As a result, $18.4 million of
premiums and policy fees were recorded in 2003 related to the collection of the
reinsurance overpayment. Overall, premiums and policy fees in the Life Marketing segment
declined $21.5 million from 2002, reflecting an increase in the use of reinsurance.
Premiums and policy fees from the Conseco transaction resulted in an increase of $7.2
million. Premiums and policy fees from older acquired blocks decreased $17.8 million as a
result of normal lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or terminations of
coverage. Premiums and policy fees in the Annuities segment increased by $0.4 million in
2003. Premiums and policy fees in the Asset Protection segment decreased by
$41.4&nbsp;million due to reduced credit earned premiums attributable to lower sales and
the termination of non-core lines of business. Premiums and policy fees in the Corporate
and Other segment decreased by $1.4 million. </FONT></P>

investment income in 2002 increased $142.8 million or 16.2% over 2001, and in 2003
increased $7.8 million or 0.8% over 2002, primarily due to increases in the average amount
of invested assets. Invested assets have increased primarily due to acquisitions,
receiving stable value and annuity deposits, and the asset growth that results from the
sale of various insurance products. The Standard coinsurance transaction and the
acquisition of Inter-State and First Variable resulted in an increase in investment income
of $57.5 million in 2002. The Conseco coinsurance transaction resulted in an increase in
investment income of $13.3 million in 2003. This increase was more than offset by $19.3
million decline in investment income from older acquisitions. </FONT></P>

sales of investments that have occurred generally result from portfolio management
decisions to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities. Realized investment gains
related to all other investments in 2002 of $80.1 million were largely offset by realized
investment losses of $79.2 million. Realized investment gains related to all other

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
quarter the Company reviews investments with material unrealized losses and tests for
other-than-temporary impairments. Management analyzes various factors to determine if any
specific other than temporary asset impairments exist. Once a determination has been made
that a specific other-than-temporary impairment exists, a realized loss is recognized and
the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value. An
other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized based upon all relevant facts and
circumstances for each investment. With respect to unrealized losses due to
issuer-specific events, the Company considers the creditworthiness and financial
performance of the issuer and other available information. With respect to unrealized
losses that are not due to issuer-specific events, such as losses due to interest rate
fluctuations, general market conditions or industry-related events, the Company considers
its intent and ability to hold the investment to allow for a market recovery or to
maturity together with an assessment of the likelihood of full recovery. See also

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with the Company&#146;s segment reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, management evaluates the results of the Company&#146;s segments on a
before-income-tax basis as adjusted for certain items which management believes are not
indicative of the Company&#146;s core operations. Segment operating income (loss) excludes
net realized investment gains and losses and the related amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and gains (losses) on derivative instruments because fluctuations in
these items are due to changes in interest rates and other financial market factors
instead of mortality and morbidity. Periodic settlements of interest rate swaps associated
with corporate debt and certain investments are included in realized gains and losses but
are considered part of operating income because the interest rate swaps are hedging items
affecting operating income. Also, segment operating income (loss) excludes any net gains
or losses on disposals of businesses, discontinued operations, and the cumulative effect
of changes in accounting principles. Although the items excluded from segment operating
income (loss) may be significant components in understanding and assessing the
Company&#146;s overall financial performance, management believes that operating segment
income (loss) enhances an investor&#146;s understanding of the Company&#146;s results of
operations by highlighting the income (loss) attributable to the normal, recurring
operations of the insurance business (i.e., mortality and morbidity), consistent with
industry practice. However, the Company&#146;s segment operating income (loss) measures
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Segment
operating income (loss) should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss)
determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP). &#147;Total income from continuing operations before income
tax&#148; is a GAAP measure to which the non-GAAP measure &#147;total operating
income&#148; may be compared. Unlike total operating income, total income before income
tax includes net realized investment gains and losses, the related amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs and gains (losses) on derivative instruments. In the
Annuities and Stable Value Products segments operating income excludes realized investment
gains and losses and related amortization. In the Corporate and Other segment operating
income includes derivative gains related to corporate debt and investments. </FONT></P>

Life Marketing segment&#146;s 2002 pretax operating income was $125.6 million, $36.0
million above 2001. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company discovered that it had
overpaid the reinsurance premiums due on certain life insurance policies, and indicated
that it would be seeking recovery of approximately $94.5 million from several reinsurance
companies. At December, 31, 2002, the Company had recorded cash and receivables totaling
$69.7 million, which reflected the amounts received at that date, and the Company&#146;s
estimate of amounts to be recovered in the future, based upon the information then
available. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
corresponding increase in premiums and policy fees resulted in $62.5 million of additional
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in 2002. The amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs took into account the amortization relating to the increase in
premiums and policy fees as well as the additional amortization required should the
remainder of the overpayment not be collected. The Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax
operating income thereby increased $7.2 million which is the difference between the
premiums recorded and the amount of such additional amortization. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the overpayments were made over a period of 10 years beginning in 1992, and had the effect
of reducing the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs during that period, the
Company believes that no prior period results were materially understated and that no
operating trends were materially affected as a result. </FONT></P>

attributed to growth through sales. </FONT></P>

Life Marketing segment&#146;s 2003 pretax operating income was $159.2 million, an increase
of $33.6 million over 2002. During 2003, the Company received payment from substantially
all of the affected reinsurance companies. As a result the Company increased premiums and
policy fees by $18.4 million and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs by $6.1
million, resulting in an increase in the Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax operating
income of $12.3 million. The remaining increase is attributable to growth of
business-in-force due to strong sales in 2002 and 2003 and favorable expense variances as
compared to pricing allowances. </FONT></P>

the ordinary course of business, the Acquisitions segment regularly considers acquisitions
of blocks of policies or smaller insurance companies. Policies acquired through the
segment are usually administered as &#147;closed&#148; blocks; i.e., no new policies are
being marketed. Therefore, earnings from the Acquisitions segment are normally expected to
decline over time (due to the lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or
terminations of coverage) unless new acquisitions are made. </FONT></P>

2002, the segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $95.1 million, $27.1 million above

Annuities segment&#146;s pretax operating income for 2002 was $15.7 million as compared to
$16.9 million in 2001. Fixed annuity earnings increased $1.2 million due to higher account
balances. This increase was more than offset by a decline in variable annuity earnings of
$2.4 million due to the general decline in the equity markets. The segment&#146;s 2003
pretax operating income was $13.4 million, a decrease of $2.3 million from 2002. The
decrease is primarily attributable to spread compression and the inability to capitalize
excess expenses due to lower sales of fixed annuities caused by lower interest rates in
2003. The segment had a $0.3 million realized investment gain (net of related amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs) in 2002 and a $3.8 million gain in 2003. As a
result, total pretax income was $16.0 million in 2002 and $17.2 million in 2003. </FONT></P>

Company offers a guaranteed minimum death benefit feature (GMDB) on its variable annuity
products. The Company&#146;s accounting policy has been to calculate its total exposure to
GMDB, and then apply a mortality factor to determine the amount of claims that could be
expected to occur in the coming twelve months. The Company then accrues to that amount
over four quarters. At December 31, 2003, the total GMDB reserve was $5.1 million. The
total guaranteed amount payable under the GMDB feature based on variable annuity account
balances at December 31, 2003, was $287.0&nbsp;million, a decrease of $252.0 million from
December 31, 2002, caused by an improvement in the equity markets. </FONT></P>

positive performance in the equity markets in 2003 allowed the Company to decrease its
GMDB related policy liabilities, the Annuities segment&#146;s future results may be
negatively affected by a slow economy. Volatile equity markets could negatively affect
sales of variable annuities and the fees the segment assesses on variable annuity
contracts. Lower interest rates have negatively affected sales of fixed annuities. In this
segment, equity market volatility may create uncertainty regarding the level of future
profitability in the variable annuity business and the related rate of amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs. </FONT></P>

Stable Value Products segment&#146;s 2002 pretax operating income was $42.3 million, $9.1
million above 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher average account balances and
operating spreads. Average account balances were $3.9 billion in 2002 as compared to $3.5
billion in 2001. Operating spreads averaged 107 basis points in 2002 compared to an
average of 90 basis points in 2001. The segment&#146;s 2003 pretax operating income was
$38.9 million, a decrease of $3.4&nbsp;million from 2002. Average operating spreads were
down to 96 basis points in 2003, causing the decrease in pretax operating income. The
primary reason for the spread compression was a reduction in yield caused by the high
level of prepayments in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio in 2003. The segments
average quarterly account balances increased by $189.6 million in 2003 to $4.1 billion.
The segment had realized investment losses in 2002 of $7.1 million compared to gains of
$9.8 million in 2003. As a result, total income before income tax was $35.2 million in
2002 and $48.7 million in 2003. </FONT></P>

included the $25.6 million charge discussed above. The segment also experienced lower
service contract administration fees of $2.8 million and lower earned credit premiums that
reduced income $5.8 million. Higher loss ratios in the vehicle service contract line
lowered earnings $2.8 million. Also, higher loss ratios in the segment&#146;s ancillary
lines led to higher losses of $5.2 million in 2002. Included in the segment&#146;s pretax
loss for 2002 was $2.7 million of income related to the sale of the inactive charter of a
small subsidiary compared to $2.0 million for a charter sale in 2001. In addition, 2001

service contract line of business improved to contribute pretax operating income of $3.7
million in 2003, as compared to a pretax operating loss of $2.8 million in 2002, due to
improving loss ratios caused by the affect of increasing prices in 2000 through 2003. The

the negative trends in used vehicle prices continued to negatively affect the segment, and
the Company took a pretax charge of $28.4 million. Examples of the negative trends
affecting the segment are lower used vehicle prices resulting from new vehicle sales
incentives and an increase in residual value claims on automobiles. Claims experience

organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate
to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization,
general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company&#146;s control. In
addition, rating organizations use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a
rated company, and from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion,
altered the models. Changes to the models could impact the rating organizations&#146;
judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. The Company cannot predict
what actions the rating organizations may take, or what actions the Company may be
required to take in response to the actions of the rating organizations, which could

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), income tax payable
by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation period of
certain life insurance and annuity products. This favorable tax treatment may give certain
of the Company&#146;s products a competitive advantage over other non-insurance products.
To the extent that the Code is revised to reduce the tax-deferred status of life insurance
and annuity products, or to increase the tax-deferred status of competing products, all
life insurance companies, including the Company and its subsidiaries, would be adversely
affected with respect to their ability to sell such products, and, depending upon
grandfathering provisions, would be affected by the surrenders of existing annuity
contracts and life insurance policies. For example, changes in laws or regulations could
restrict or eliminate the advantages of certain corporate or bank-owned life insurance
products. Recent changes in tax law, which have reduced the federal income tax rates on
corporate dividends in certain circumstances, could make the tax advantages of investing
in certain life insurance or annuity products less attractive. Additionally, changes in
tax law based on proposals to establish new tax advantaged retirement and life savings
plans, if enacted, could reduce the tax advantage of investing in certain life insurance
or annuity products. In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate
tax obligations. Legislation has been enacted that would, over time, reduce and eventually
eliminate the estate tax. If the estate tax is significantly reduced or eliminated, the
demand for certain life insurance products could be adversely affected. Additionally, the

No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138, and 149, requires the Company to record all
derivative financial instruments, at fair value on the balance sheet. Changes in fair
value of a derivative instrument are reported in net income or other comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use of the derivative instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 133
resulted in a cumulative charge to net income, net of income tax, of $7.6 million ($0.11
per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and a cumulative after-tax increase to other
comprehensive income of $4.0 million on January 1, 2001. The charge to net income and
increase to other comprehensive income primarily resulted from the recognition of
derivative instruments embedded in the Company&#146;s corporate bond portfolio. In
addition, the charge to net income includes the recognition of the ineffectiveness on
existing hedging relationships including the difference in spot and forward exchange rates
related to foreign currency swaps used as an economic hedge of
foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 has
introduced volatility into the Company&#146;s reported net income and other comprehensive
income depending on market conditions and the Company&#146;s hedging activities. </FONT></P>

January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145, &#147;Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April
2002.&#148; SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4, which required companies to treat the
extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 requires companies to apply
APB Opinion No. 30 when determining the accounting for the extinguishment of debt. The
statement also rescinds and amends other statements to make various technical corrections
and clarifications. SFAS No. 145 requires the Company to restate previously issued
financial statements to reclassify losses related to the early extinguishment of debt from
extraordinary losses to operating expenses. The Company&#146;s 2002 financial statements
have been restated, in accordance with SFAS No. 145, to reclassify the $2.2 million
charge, which resulted from the redemption of subordinate debentures. </FONT></P>

January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
No. (FIN) 46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,&#148; which was revised
in December 2003. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
&#147;Consolidated Financial Statements,&#148; to certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated support from other parties. The effective date of FIN 46 is March&nbsp;31,
2004, for the Company. However, FIN 46 shall be applied to entities that are considered
special-purpose entities no later than as of the end of the first reporting period that
ends after December 15, 2003 (December 31, 2003, for the Company). As such, the Company
consolidated, as of December 31, 2003, a special-purpose entity whose investments are
managed by the Company. The special-purpose entity was consolidated based on the
determination that the Company was its primary beneficiary. The consolidation resulted in
the Company&#146;s reported assets and liabilities increasing by $430.6 million with an
immaterial impact on the results of operations. The increase in assets was the result of
the entity&#146;s $430.6 million investment portfolio, while the increase in liabilities
was due to $400.0 million of notes payable (reported in &#147;liabilities related to
variable interest entities&#148;), $15.0 million of derivative liabilities (reported in
&#147;other liabilities&#148;), and $15.6 million of minority interest (reported in
&#147;other liabilities&#148;). Additionally, the Company deconsolidated, as of December
31, 2003, the special-purpose entities PLC Capital Trust III and PLC Capital Trust IV
after determining the Company was not the primary beneficiary of these special-purpose
entities. The deconsolidation resulted in a $6.6 million increase to
&#147;investments&#148; and &#147;subordinate debt securities&#148;. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on entities not considered to be special-purpose
entities, which would be required to be consolidated as of March 31, 2004. Although the
Company does not expect the implementation of the provisions of FIN 46, on March 31, 2004,
to have a material impact on its results of operations, had the provisions been effective
at December 31, 2003, the Company&#146;s reported assets and liabilities would have
increased by approximately $109 million. </FONT></P>

October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. B36,
&#147;Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That
Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the
Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments&#148; (DIG B36). DIG B36 requires
the bifurcation of embedded derivatives within certain modified coinsurance and funds
withheld coinsurance arrangements that expose the creditor to credit risk of a company
other than the debtor, even if the debtor owns as investment assets the third-party
securities to which the creditor is exposed. The adoption did not have a material impact
on the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>

July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 03-1, &#147;Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.&#148; SOP 03-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2003. SOP 03-1 provides
guidance related to the reporting and disclosure of certain insurance contracts and
separate accounts, including the calculation of guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB).
SOP 03-1 also addresses the capitalization and amortization of sales inducements to
contract holders. Had the provision been effective at December 31, 2003, the Company would
have reported a GMDB accrual $0.3 million higher than currently reported. Although the
original intent of SOP 03-1 was to address the accounting for contract provisions not
addressed by SFAS No. 97, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits within a variable
annuity contract, it appears that SOP 03-1 contains language that may impact the
accounting for universal life products in a material way. The life insurance industry and
some insurance companies have filed letters with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants seeking clarification, guidance, delay and/or revision to more
appropriately reflect the underlying economic issues of universal life insurance products.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SOP 03-1 on the accounting for its
universal life products. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132, &#147;Employers&#146; Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,&#148; as revised by the FASB in December
2003. The FASB revised disclosure requirements for pension plans and other postretirement
benefit plans to require more information. The revision of SFAS No. 132 did not have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations. </FONT></P>

December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act introduces a
prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees in 2006, as well as a federal
subsidy to plan sponsors that provide prescription drug benefits. In accordance with FASB
Staff Position No. 106-1, the Company has elected to defer recognizing the effects of the
Medicare Act for its postretirement plans under FASB Statement No. 106,
&#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension,&#148;
until authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is issued. The Company
anticipates that the Medicare Act will not have a material impact on the financial results
of the Company; therefore the costs reported in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements do not reflect these changes. The final accounting guidance could require
changes to previously reported information. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities (bonds
and redeemable preferred stocks) and commercial mortgage loans. The Company generally
purchases its investments with the intent to hold to maturity by purchasing investments
that match future cash flow needs. However, the Company may sell any of its investments to
maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has
classified $12.9 billion of its fixed maturities and certain other securities as

Company&#146;s investments in debt and equity securities are reported at market value, and
investments in mortgage loans are reported at amortized cost. At December 31, 2003, the
Company&#146;s fixed maturity investments (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) had a
market value of $13.4 billion, which is 4.8% above amortized cost of $12.7 billion. The
Company had $2.7 billion in mortgage loans at December 31, 2003. While the Company&#146;s
mortgage loans do not have quoted market values, at December 31, 2003, the Company
estimates the market value of its mortgage loans to be $3.0&nbsp;billion (using discounted
cash flows from the next call date), which is 8.2% above amortized cost. Most of the
Company&#146;s mortgage loans have significant prepayment fees. These assets are invested
for terms approximately corresponding to anticipated future benefit payments. Thus, market
fluctuations are not expected to adversely affect liquidity. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s management considers a number of factors when determining the impairment
status of individual securities. These include the economic condition of various industry
segments and geographic locations and other areas of identified risks. Although it is
possible for the impairment of one investment to affect other investments, the Company
engages in ongoing risk management to safeguard against and limit any further risk to its
investment portfolio. Special attention is given to correlative risks within specific
industries, related parties and business markets. </FONT></P>

management has determined that a particular investment has suffered an
other-than-temporary impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
The Company generally considers a number of factors in determining whether the impairment
is other than temporary. These include, but are not limited to: 1) actions taken by rating
agencies, 2) default by the issuer, 3) the significance of the decline, 4) the intent and
ability of the Company to hold the investment until recovery, 5) the time period during
which the decline has occurred, 6) an economic analysis of the issuer&#146;s industry, and
7) the financial strength, liquidity, and recoverability of the issuer. Management
performs a security by security review each quarter in evaluating the need for any
other-than-temporary impairments. Although no set formula is used in this process, the
investment performance, collateral position and continued viability of the issuer are
significant measures. </FONT></P>

Company generally considers a number of factors relating to the issuer in determining the
financial strength, liquidity, and recoverability of an issuer. These include but are not
limited to: available collateral, tangible and intangible assets that might be available
to repay debt, operating cash flows, financial ratios, access to capital markets, quality
of management, market position, exposure to litigation or product warranties, and the
effect of general economic conditions on the issuer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market
values are other than temporary. These include significant changes in general economic
conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate
fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and
assumptions, commission of fraud and legislative actions. The Company continuously
monitors these factors as they relate to the investment portfolio in determining the
status of each investment. Provided below are additional facts concerning the potential
effect upon the Company&#146;s earnings should circumstances lead management to conclude
that some of the current declines in market value are other than temporary. </FONT></P>

values for private, non-traded securities are determined as follows: 1) the Company
obtains estimates from independent pricing services or 2) the Company estimates market
value based upon a comparison to quoted issues of the same issuer or issues of other
issuers with similar terms and risk characteristics. The market value of private,
non-traded securities was $1,975.3 million at December 31, 2003, representing 11.3% of the
Company&#146;s total invested assets. </FONT></P>

securities issued in Company-sponsored commercial mortgage loan securitizations, including

December 31, 2003, $21.1 million of below investment grade securities in an unrealized
loss position were securities issued in Company-sponsored commercial mortgage loan
securitizations, including $18.1 million in an unrealized loss position greater than five

The mortgage loan commitment is a contractual obligation to fund a mortgage loan when

financial statements until the commitment is actually funded. The mortgage loan commitment
contains terms, including the rate of interest, which may be less than prevailing interest

to changes in interest rates for certain investments, primarily outstanding mortgage loan
commitments and mortgage-backed securities. Interest rate swap contracts generally involve
the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a
common notional principal amount and maturity date. Interest rate futures generally
involve exchange traded contracts to buy or sell treasury bonds and notes in the future at
specified prices. Interest rate options allow the holder of the option to receive cash or
purchase, sell or enter into a financial instrument at a specified price within a
specified period of time. The Company used interest rate swap contracts, swaptions
(options to enter into interest rate swap contracts), caps, and floors to modify the
interest characteristics of certain investments, its Senior Notes, Medium-Term Notes, and
subordinated debt securities. Swap contracts are also used to alter the effective
durations of assets and liabilities. The Company uses foreign currency swaps to reduce its
exposure to currency exchange risk on certain stable value contracts denominated in
foreign currencies, primarily the European euro and the British pound. </FONT></P>

September 2000, the Company entered into a transaction to facilitate the Company&#146;s
possible entry into the institutional money management business involving a total return
swap with respect to $400 million &#150; of a portfolio of investments held by an
unrelated special purpose entity &#150; that are managed by the Company. The Company, in
effect, has retained the investment risk with respect to the $400 million. As of December
31, 2003, this unrelated special-purpose entity was required to be consolidated due to the
implementation of FIN 46. At December 31, 2003, this special-purpose entity held interest
rate swaps in its portfolio and a related total return swap. The swaps are recorded on the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures involve the monitoring
of asset and liability durations for various product lines; cash flow testing under
various interest rate scenarios; and the continuous rebalancing of assets and liabilities
with respect to yield, risk, and cash flow characteristics. It is the Company&#146;s
policy to generally maintain asset and liability durations within one-half year of one
another, although, from time to time, a broader interval may be allowed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company believes its asset/liability management programs and procedures and certain
product features provide protection for the Company against the effects of changes in
interest rates under various scenarios. Additionally, the Company believes its
asset/liability management programs and procedures provide sufficient liquidity to enable
it to fulfill its obligation to pay benefits under its various insurance and deposit
contracts. However, the Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures
incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term interest
rates (i.e., the slope of the yield curve), relationships between risk-adjusted and
risk-free interest rates, market liquidity and other factors, and the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures may be negatively
affected whenever actual results differ from those assumptions. </FONT></P>

2003. Cash outflows related to stable value contracts are estimated to be approximately
$1,106.1 million in 2004. The Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and

exceed the funds then available. Therefore, the Company has arranged sources of credit for
its insurance subsidiaries to use when needed. The Company expects that the rate received
on its investments will equal or exceed its borrowing rate. Additionally, the Company may,
from time to time, sell short-duration stable value products to complement its cash
management practices. </FONT></P>

$59.9 million of which was issued to redeem the Company&#146;s outstanding 7.50% 15-year
Senior Notes on January 1, 2004. In addition, the Company repaid the $25 million
outstanding as of December 31, 2003, on its $200 million line of credit. The balance of
the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, affording the Company additional
financial flexibility in the future. </FONT></P>

life insurance company&#146;s statutory capital is computed according to rules prescribed
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), as modified by the
insurance company&#146;s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are intended
to reflect a more conservative view by, for example, requiring immediate expensing of
policy acquisition costs. The NAIC&#146;s risk-based capital requirements require
insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based capital
formula. The achievement of long-term growth will require growth in the statutory capital
of the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may secure additional
statutory capital through various sources, such as retained statutory earnings or equity
contributions by the Company. </FONT></P>

table above excludes liabilities related to separate accounts of $2,220.8 million.
Separate account liabilities represent funds maintained for contract holders who bear the
related investment risk. These liabilities are supported by assets that are legally
segregated and are not subject to claims that arise from other business activities of the
Company. These assets and liabilities are separately identified on the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company. The table also excludes future cash flows related to
certain insurance liabilities due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of the
cash flows. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation
increases the need for life insurance. Many policyholders who once had adequate insurance
programs may increase their life insurance coverage to provide the same relative financial
benefit and protection. Higher interest rates may result in higher sales of certain of the
Company&#146;s investment products. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
higher interest rates that have traditionally accompanied inflation could also affect the
Company&#146;s operations. Policy loans increase as policy loan interest rates become
relatively more attractive. As interest rates increase, disintermediation of stable value
and annuity account balances and individual life policy cash values may increase. The
market value of the Company&#146;s fixed-rate, long-term investments may decrease, the
Company may be unable to implement fully the interest rate reset and call provisions of
its mortgage loans, and the Company&#146;s ability to make attractive mortgage loans,
including participating mortgage loans, may decrease. In addition, participating mortgage
loan income may decrease. The difference between the interest rate earned on investments
and the interest rate credited to life insurance and investment products may also be
adversely affected by rising interest rates. </FONT></P>

January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;. SFAS
No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138, and 149, requires the Company to record all
derivative financial instruments at fair value on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value
of a derivative instrument are reported in net income or other comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use of the derivative instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 133
resulted in a cumulative charge to net income, net of income tax, of $7.6 million ($0.11
per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and a cumulative after-tax increase to other
comprehensive income of $4.0 million on January 1, 2001. The charge to net income and
increase to other comprehensive income primarily resulted from the recognition of
derivative instruments embedded in the Company&#146;s corporate bond portfolio. In
addition, the charge to net income includes the recognition of the ineffectiveness on
existing hedging relationships including the difference in spot and forward exchange rates
related to foreign currency swaps used as an economic hedge of
foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 has
introduced volatility into the Company&#146;s reported net income and other comprehensive
income depending on market conditions and the Company&#146;s hedging activities. </FONT></P>

January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.&#148; SFAS No. 142 revises the standards for accounting for acquired goodwill and
other intangible assets. The standard replaces the requirement to amortize goodwill with
one that calls for an annual impairment test, among other provisions. The Company has
performed an impairment test and determined that its goodwill was not impaired at October
31, 2003, and 2002. The following table illustrates adjusted income from continuing
operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as if this
pronouncement was adopted as of January&nbsp;1, 2001: </FONT></P>

January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145, &#147;Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April
2002.&#148; SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4, which required companies to treat the
extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 requires companies to apply
APB Opinion No. 30 when determining the accounting for the extinguishment of debt. The
statement also rescinds and amends other statements to make various technical corrections
and clarifications. SFAS No. 145 requires the Company to restate previously issued
financial statements to reclassify losses related to the early extinguishment of debt from
extraordinary losses to operating expenses. The Company&#146;s 2002 financial statements
have been restated, in accordance with SFAS No. 145, to reclassify the $2.2 million
charge, which resulted from the redemption of subordinate debentures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
No. (FIN) 46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,&#148; which was revised
in December 2003. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
&#147;Consolidated Financial Statements,&#148; to certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated support from other parties. The effective date of FIN 46 is March&nbsp;31,
2004, for the Company. However, FIN 46 shall be applied to entities that are considered
special-purpose entities no later than as of the end of the first reporting period that
ends after December 15, 2003 (December 31, 2003, for the Company). As such, the Company
consolidated, as of December 31, 2003, a special-purpose entity whose investments are
managed by the Company. The special-purpose entity was consolidated based on the
determination that the Company was its primary beneficiary. The consolidation resulted in
the Company&#146;s reported assets and liabilities increasing by $430.6 million with an
immaterial impact on the results of operations. The increase in assets was the result of
the entity&#146;s $430.6 million investment portfolio, while the increase in liabilities
was due to $400.0 million of notes payable (reported in &#147;liabilities related to
variable interest entities&#148;), $15.0 million of derivative liabilities (reported in
&#147;other liabilities&#148;), and $15.6 million of minority interest (reported in
&#147;other liabilities&#148;). Additionally, the Company deconsolidated, as of December
31, 2003, the special-purpose entities PLC Capital Trust III and PLC Capital Trust IV
after determining the Company was not the primary beneficiary of these special-purpose
entities. The deconsolidation resulted in a $6.6 million increase to
&#147;investments&#148; and &#147;subordinated debt securities&#148;. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on entities not considered to be special-purpose
entities, which would be required to be consolidated as of March 31, 2004. Although the
Company does not expect the implementation of the provisions of FIN 46, on March 31, 2004,
to have a material impact on its results of operations, had the provisions been effective
at December 31, 2003, the Company&#146;s reported assets and liabilities would have
increased by approximately $109 million. </FONT></P>

October 1, 2003, the Company adopted Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. B36,
&#147;Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That
Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the
Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments&#148; (DIG B36). DIG B36 requires
the bifurcation of embedded derivatives within certain modified coinsurance and funds
withheld coinsurance arrangements that expose the creditor to credit risk of a company
other than the debtor, even if the debtor owns as investment assets the third-party
securities to which the creditor is exposed. The adoption did not have a material impact
on its financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>

July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 03-1, &#147;Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.&#148; SOP 03-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2003. SOP 03-1 provides
guidance related to the reporting and disclosure of certain insurance contracts and
separate accounts, including the calculation of guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB).
SOP 03-1 also addresses the capitalization and amortization of sales inducements to
contract holders. Had the provision been effective at December 31, 2003, the Company would
have reported a GMDB accrual $0.3 million higher than currently reported. Although the
original intent of SOP 03-1 was to address the accounting for contract provisions not
addressed by SFAS No. 97, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits within a variable
annuity contract, it appears that SOP 03-1 contains language that may impact the
accounting for universal life products in a material way. The life insurance industry and
some insurance companies have filed letters with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants seeking clarification, guidance, delay and/or revision to more
appropriately reflect the underlying economic issues of universal life insurance products.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SOP 03-1 on the accounting for its
universal life products. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132, &#147;Employers&#146; Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,&#148; as revised by the FASB in December
2003. The FASB revised disclosure requirements for pension plans and other postretirement
benefit plans to require more information. The revision of SFAS No. 132 did not have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations. </FONT></P>

December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act introduces a
prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees in 2006, as well as a federal
subsidy to plan sponsors that provide prescription drug benefits. In accordance with FASB
Staff Position No. 106-1, the Company has elected to defer recognizing the effects of the
Medicare Act for its postretirement plans under FASB Statement No. 106,
&#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension,&#148;
until authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is issued. The Company
anticipates that the Medicare Act will not have a material impact on the financial results
of the Company; therefore the costs reported in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements do not reflect these changes. The final accounting guidance could require
changes to previously reported information. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combinations
of interest rate swap contracts, futures contracts, and option contracts are sometimes
used to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks, including those related
to changes in interest rates for certain investments, primarily outstanding mortgage loan
commitments and mortgage-backed securities. Interest rate swap contracts generally involve
the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a
common notional principal amount and maturity date. Interest rate futures generally
involve exchange traded contracts to buy or sell treasury bonds and notes in the future at
specified prices. Interest rate options allow the holder of the option to receive cash or
purchase, sell or enter into a financial instrument at a specified price within a
specified period of time. The Company uses interest rate swap contracts, swaptions
(options to enter into interest rate swap contracts), caps, and floors to modify the
interest characteristics of certain investments, and its Senior Notes, Medium-Term Notes,
and subordinated debt securities. Swap contracts are also used to alter the effective
durations of assets and liabilities. The Company uses foreign currency swaps to reduce its
exposure to currency exchange risk on certain stable value contracts denominated in
foreign currencies, primarily the European euro and the British pound. </FONT></P>

derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet (in &#147;other long-term
investments&#148; or &#147;other liabilities&#148;) at their fair value (primarily
estimates from independent pricing services). On the date the derivative contract is
entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
(&#147;fair-value&#148; hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or
liability (&#147;cash-flow&#148; hedge), or (3) as a derivative either held for investment
purposes or held as an instrument designed to mitigate the economic changes in value or
cash flows of another instrument (&#147;other&#148; derivative). Changes in the fair value
of a derivative that is highly effective as &#150; and that is designated and qualifies as
&#150; a fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability
that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm commitments),
are recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective as &#150; and that is designated and qualified as &#150; a cash-flow
hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows. Changes in the fair value of other derivatives are recognized
in current earnings and reported in &#147;Realized investment gains (losses) &#150;
derivative financial instruments&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of

as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as
fair-value or cash-flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or
to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally
assesses, both at the hedge&#146;s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly

adjusted for changes in fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued because the
hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, the derivative will
continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and any asset or liability
that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment will be removed from the
balance sheet and recognized as a gain or loss in current-period earnings. When hedge
accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not
occur, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value,
and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will remain
therein until such time as they are reclassified to earnings as originally forecasted to
occur. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be
carried at its fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value recognized
in current-period earnings. </FONT></P>

Hedges</B>. During 2003, there were no fair value hedges outstanding. In 2002 and 2001,
the Company designated, as fair value hedges, callable interest rate swaps used to modify
the interest characteristics of certain callable Medium-Term Notes and stable value
contracts. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes the embedded call
option&#146;s time value component from each derivative&#146;s total gain or loss. In 2002
and 2001, total measured ineffectiveness for the fair value hedging relationships was
insignificant while the excluded time value component resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0 and
$1.3 million, respectively. Both the measured ineffectiveness and the excluded time value
component are reported in &#147;Realized investment gains (losses) &#150; Derivative
financial instruments&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Cash-Flow
Hedges</B>. The Company has entered into a foreign currency swap to hedge the risk of
changes in the value of interest and principal payments to be made on certain of its
foreign-currency-based stable value contracts. Under the terms of the swap, the Company
pays a fixed U.S.-dollar-denominated rate and receives a fixed
foreign-currency-denominated rate. Effective July 1, 2002, the Company designated this
swap as a cash flow hedge and therefore recorded the change in the fair value of the swap
during the period in accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2003 and 2002, a pretax
loss of $66.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively, representing the change in fair
value of the hedged contracts, and a gain of like amount representing the application of
hedge accounting to this transaction, were recorded in &#147;Realized investment gains
(losses) &#150; Derivative financial instruments&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated
condensed statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the amount
of the hedge&#146;s ineffectiveness reported in income was a $0.3 million gain and an
immaterial loss, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
reported an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.7 million (net of
income tax of $1.4 million) and a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of
$2.1 million (net of income tax of $1.1 million), respectively, related to its derivative
designated as a cash flow hedge. During 2004, the Company expects to reclassify out of
accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings, as a reduction of interest
expense, approximately $3.4 million. </FONT></P>

flows of outstanding mortgage loan commitments and certain owned investments as well as
certain debt and preferred security obligations of the Company. In 2003, 2002, and 2001,
the Company recognized net pre-tax gains of $5.6 million, net pre-tax gains of $46.7
million, and net pre-tax losses of $0.5 million, respectively, representing the change in
fair value of these derivative instruments as well as a realized gain or loss on contracts
closed during the period. </FONT></P>

its foreign currency swaps, the Company recognized a $2.6 million pre-tax gain in 2003
while recognizing a $1.9 million foreign exchange pre-tax loss on the related
foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts. In 2002, the Company recognized a
$70.8 million pre-tax gain while recognizing a $74.9 million foreign exchange pre-tax loss
on the related foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts. In 2001, the Company
recognized an $8.2 million pre-tax loss on its foreign currency swaps while recognizing an
$11.2 million foreign exchange pre-tax gain on the related foreign-currency-denominated
stable value contracts. The net loss and net gain in 2002 and 2001, respectively,
primarily results from the difference in the forward and spot exchange rates used to
revalue the currency swaps and the stable value contracts, respectively. This net loss and
net gain is reflected in &#147;Realized investment gains (losses) &#150; Derivative
financial instruments&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated condensed statements of

Company recognized pre-tax gains of $3.0 million, $2.0 million, and $12.2 million,
respectively, for the change in the asset swaps&#146; fair value and recognized a $0.1

and other costs of acquiring traditional life and health insurance, credit insurance,
universal life insurance, and investment products that vary with and are primarily related
to the production of new business, have been deferred. Traditional life and health
insurance acquisition costs are amortized over the premium-payment period of the related
policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium income to the present value of the
total anticipated premium income. Credit insurance acquisition costs are being amortized
in proportion to earned premium. Acquisition costs for universal life and investment
products are amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of
estimated gross profits before amortization. Under SFAS No. 97, &#147;Accounting and
Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments,&#148; the Company makes certain assumptions
regarding the mortality, persistency, expenses, and interest rates (equal to the rate used
to compute liabilities for future policy benefits; currently 2.6% to 9.4%) it expects to
experience in future periods. These assumptions are to be best estimates and are to be
periodically updated whenever actual experience and/or expectations for the future change
from that assumed. Additionally, relating to SFAS No. 115, these costs have been adjusted
by an amount equal to the amortization that would have been recorded if unrealized gains
or losses on investments associated with the Company&#146;s universal life and investment
products had been realized. </FONT></P>

such blocks of insurance, is also included in deferred policy acquisition costs. The
Company amortizes the present value of future profits over the premium payment period,
including accrued interest of up to approximately 8%. The unamortized present value of
future profits for all acquisitions was approximately $502.2 million and $542.5 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, no present value of profits was
capitalized and $40.3 million was amortized. During 2002, $62.5&nbsp;million of present

Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Income tax
provisions are generally based on income reported for financial statement purposes.
Deferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between
the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the
basis determined for income tax purposes. Such temporary differences are principally
related to the deferral of policy acquisition costs and the provision for future policy
benefits and expenses. </FONT></P>

specific other than temporary asset impairments exist. Once a determination has been made
that a specific other-than-temporary impairment exists, a realized loss is incurred and
the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value. During 2003, 2002, and

mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months,
$23.3 million of the unrealized loss relates to securities issued in Company-sponsored
commercial loan securitizations. The Company does not consider these unrealized loss

composed of $2.8&nbsp;million of electrical industry securities, $5.0 million of
transportation industry securities, and $1.3 million of other industry securities. The
aggregate decline in market value of these securities was deemed temporary due to positive

Company participates in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement,
whereby securities that are held as investments are loaned to third parties for short
periods of time. The Company requires collateral of 102% of the market value of the loaned
securities to be separately maintained. The loaned securities&#146; market value is
monitored, on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained as necessary. At December
31, 2003, securities with a market value of $324.5 million were loaned under these
agreements. As collateral for the loaned securities, the Company receives short-term
investments, which are recorded in &#147;short-term investments&#148; with a corresponding
liability recorded in &#147;other liabilities&#148; to account for the Company&#146;s
obligation to return the collateral. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December 31, 2003, all of the Company&#146;s mortgage loans were commercial loans of which
75% were retail, 8% were apartments, 8% were office buildings, 8% were warehouses, and 1%
were other. The Company specializes in making mortgage loans on either credit-oriented or
credit-anchored commercial properties. No single tenant&#146;s leased space represents
more than 2.8% of mortgage loans. Approximately 74% of the mortgage loans are on
properties located in the following states listed in decreasing order of significance:
Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, Florida,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, Mississippi and Washington. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the mortgage loans have call provisions between 3 and 10 years. Assuming the loans are
called at their next call dates, approximately $125.0 million would become due in 2004,
$537.3 million in 2005 through 2008, $461.5 million in 2009 through 2013, and $40.2

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
several years the Company has offered a type of commercial mortgage loan under which the
Company will permit a slightly higher loan-to-value ratio in exchange for a participating
interest in the cash flows from the underlying real estate. As of December 31, 2003 and
2002, approximately $382.7 million and $475.5 million, respectively, of the Company&#146;s
mortgage loans have this participation feature. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company&#146;s problem mortgage loans (over ninety days
past due) and foreclosed properties totaled $11.8 million and $16.2 million, respectively.
Since the Company&#146;s mortgage loans are collateralized by real estate, any assessment
of impairment is based upon the estimated fair value of the real estate. Based on the
Company&#146;s evaluation of its mortgage loan portfolio, the Company does not expect any
material losses on its mortgage loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
pre-1984 life insurance company income tax laws, a portion of the Company&#146;s gain from
operations which was not subject to current income taxation was accumulated for income tax
purposes in a memorandum account designated as Policyholders&#146; Surplus. The aggregate
accumulation in this account at December 31, 2003, was approximately $70.5&nbsp;million.
Should the accumulation in the Policyholders&#146; Surplus account of the life insurance
subsidiaries exceed certain stated maximums, or should distributions including cash
dividends be made to Protective Life Corporation in excess of approximately $1.6 billion,
such excess would be subject to federal income taxes at rates then effective. Deferred
income taxes have not been provided on amounts designated as Policyholders&#146; Surplus.
Under current income tax laws, the Company does not anticipate paying income tax on
amounts in the Policyholders&#146; Surplus accounts. </FONT></P>

2000, the Company entered into an arrangement with an unrelated party for the construction
of a building contiguous to its existing home office complex. The unrelated party owns the
building and leases it to the Company. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease
under SFAS No. 13 &#147;Accounting For Leases&#148;. Lease payments commenced upon
completion, which occurred January 31, 2003, and is based on current LIBOR interest rates
and the cost of the building. At the end of the lease term, February 1, 2007, the Company
may purchase the building for the original building cost of approximately $75 million.
Based upon current interest rates, annual lease payments are estimated to be $1.5 million.
Were the Company not to purchase the building, a payment of approximately $66 million

insurance guaranty fund laws, in most states insurance companies doing business therein
can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent
companies. The Company does not believe such assessments will be materially different from
amounts already provided for in the financial statements. Most of these laws do provide,
however, that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an
insurer&#146;s own financial strength. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers and other providers of
financial services involving sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to
properly supervise representatives, relationships with agents or persons with whom the
insurer does business, and other matters. Increasingly these lawsuits have resulted in the
award of substantial judgments that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including
material amounts of punitive and non-economic compensatory damages. In some states,
juries, judges, and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding punitive and
non-economic compensatory damages which creates the potential for unpredictable material
adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or arbitration. Arbitration awards are
subject to very little appellate review. In addition, in some class action and other
lawsuits, companies have made material settlement payments. The Company, like other
financial service companies, in the ordinary course of business, is involved in such
litigation and in arbitration. Although the outcome of any such litigation or arbitration
cannot be predicted, the Company believes that at the present time there are no pending or
threatened lawsuits that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity of the Company. </FONT></P>

certain events associated with a change in control of the Company occur, any unallocated

the Company&#146;s long-range performance through the awarding of stock-based

criteria for payment of performance awards is based primarily upon a comparison of the
Company&#146;s average return on average equity and total rate of return over a four-year
award period (earlier upon the death, disability, or retirement of the executive, or in
certain circumstances, of a change in control of the Company) to that of a comparison
group of publicly held life and multiline insurance companies. If the Company&#146;s
results are below the median of the comparison group, no portion of the award is earned.
If the Company&#146;s results are at or above the 90th percentile, the award maximum is
earned. Awards are paid in shares of Company Common Stock. </FONT></P>

commissioner of the state of domicile unless such commissioner objects to the dividend
prior to the expiration of such period. Dividends in larger amounts are considered
extraordinary and are subject to affirmative prior approval by such commissioner. The

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial
statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America differ in some respects from the statutory accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities. The most significant
differences are as follows: (a) acquisition costs of obtaining new business are deferred
and amortized over the approximate life of the policies rather than charged to operations
as incurred; (b) benefit liabilities are computed using a net level method and are based
on realistic estimates of expected mortality, interest, and withdrawals as adjusted to
provide for possible unfavorable deviation from such assumptions; (c) deferred income
taxes are not subject to statutory limitations as to amounts recognized and are recognized
through earnings as opposed to being charged to share-owners&#146; equity; (d) the Asset
Valuation Reserve and Interest Maintenance Reserve are restored to share-owners&#146;
equity; (e) furniture and equipment, agents&#146; debit balances, and prepaid expenses are
reported as assets rather than being charged directly to surplus (referred to as
nonadmitted assets); (f) certain items of interest income, such as mortgage and bond
discounts, are amortized differently; and (g) bonds are recorded at their market values
instead of amortized cost. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has
adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles (Codification). Codification
changed statutory accounting rules in several areas and was effective January 1, 2001. The
adoption of Codification did not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s insurance
subsidiaries&#146; statutory capital. </FONT></P>

Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of net investment income and expenses not

and interest on substantially all debt). This segment also includes earnings from several small non-strategic lines of business
(primarily cancer insurance, residual value insurance, surety insurance and
group annuities). During 2004, a decision was made by management to move the surety and residual value insurance lines from the Asset Protection
segment to Corporate and Other.  All segment information presented has been amended to reflect such change.</FONT></P>

Company uses the same accounting policies and procedures to measure operating segment
income and assets as it uses to measure its consolidated net income and assets. Operating
segment income is generally income before income tax, adjusted to exclude any pretax
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries. Premiums and policy fees, other
income, benefits and settlement expenses, and amortization of deferred policy acquisition
costs are attributed directly to each operating segment. Net investment income is
allocated based on directly related assets required for transacting the business of that
segment. Realized investment gains (losses) and other operating expenses are allocated to
the segments in a manner which most appropriately reflects the operations of that segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees.
The benefits are based on years of service and the employee&#146;s highest thirty-six
consecutive months of compensation. The Company&#146;s funding policy is to contribute
amounts to the plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA plus such
additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date
but also for those expected to be earned in the future. </FONT></P>

expense will be $6.4&nbsp;million, which is the Company&#146;s estimate of its expected

benefit obligations of the plan is December 31, 2003. </FONT></P>

to July 1999, upon an employee&#146;s retirement, a distribution from pension plan assets
was used to purchase a single premium annuity from Protective Life in the retiree&#146;s
name. Therefore, amounts shown above as plan assets exclude assets relating to such
retirees. Since July 1999, retiree obligations have been fulfilled from pension plan
assets. The defined benefit pension plan has a target asset allocation of 60% domestic
equities, 38% fixed income, and 2% cash and cash equivalents. When calculating asset
allocation, the Company includes reserves for pre-July 1999 retirees. Based on historical
data of the domestic equity markets and the Company&#146;s group annuity investments, the
plan&#146;s target asset allocation would be expected to earn annualized returns in excess
of 9% per year. In arriving at the plan&#146;s 8.5% expected rate of return, the Company
has adjusted this historical data to reflect lower expectations for equity returns. The
plan&#146;s equity assets are invested in a domestic equity index collective trust managed
by Northern Trust Corporation. The plan&#146;s cash equivalents are invested in a
collective trust managed by Northern Trust Corporation. The plan&#146;s fixed income
assets are invested in a group annuity contract with Protective Life. </FONT></P>

provides defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by
federal tax law. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the projected benefit obligation of this
plan totaled $18.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively, of which $15.5 million and
$14.4 million, respectively, have been recognized in the Company&#146;s financial

addition to pension benefits, the Company provides limited healthcare benefits to eligible
retired employees until age 65. This postretirement benefit is provided by an unfunded
plan. This benefit has no material effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements. For a closed group of retirees over age 65, Protective provides a prescription
drug benefit. At December 31, 2003, the Company&#146;s liability related to this benefit
was $0.3 million. The Company&#146;s obligation is not materially affected by a 1% change
in the healthcare cost trend assumptions used in the calculation of the obligation. </FONT></P>

Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan which covers substantially all
employees. Employee contributions are made on a before-tax basis as provided by Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has established an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) to match voluntary employee contributions to the Company&#146;s
401(k) Plan. In 1994, a stock bonus component was added to the 401(k) Plan for employees
who are not otherwise under a bonus or sales incentive plan. Expense related to the ESOP
consists of the cost of the shares allocated to participating employees plus the interest
expense on the ESOP&#146;s note payable to the Company less dividends on shares held by
the ESOP. All shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding for purposes of computing
earnings per share. At December 31, 2003, the Company had committed approximately 124,682
shares to be released to fund the 401(k) Plan match. The expense recorded by the Company
for these employee benefits was $0.6 million, $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million in
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. </FONT></P>

Company reinsures certain of its risks with, and assumes risks from, other insurers under
yearly renewable term, coinsurance, and modified coinsurance agreements. Under yearly
renewable term agreements, the Company generally pays specific premiums to the reinsurer
and receives specific amounts from the reinsurer as reimbursement for certain expenses.
Coinsurance agreements are accounted for by passing a portion of the risk to the
reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate part of the premiums less
commissions and is liable for a corresponding part of all benefit payments. Modified
coinsurance is accounted for similarly to coinsurance except that the liability for future
policy benefits is held by the original company, and settlements are made on a net basis
between the companies. A substantial portion of the Company&#146;s new life insurance and
credit insurance sales is being reinsured. The Company reviews the financial condition of
its reinsurers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company continues to monitor the consolidation of reinsurers and the concentration of
credit risk the Company has with any reinsurer. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
reinsured approximately 89.6% of the face value of its life insurance in force. The
Company had reinsured approximately 59.1% of the face value of its life insurance in force
with three reinsurers. These reinsurers had a minimum Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s rating of
AA- and a minimum A. M. Best rating of A+. The Company has not experienced any credit
losses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, or 2001 related to these reinsurers. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has reinsured approximately $292.7 billion, $219.0 billion, and $171.4 billion in
face amount of life insurance risks with other insurers representing $781.8 million,
$546.0 million, and $565.1 million of premium income for 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. The Company has also reinsured accident and health risks representing $61.6
million, $61.5 million, and $122.7 million of premium income for 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. In addition, the Company reinsured property and casualty risks representing
$91.0 million, $143.9 million, and $83.3 million of premium income for 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively. In 2003 and 2002, policy and claim reserves relating to insurance
ceded of $2,230.7&nbsp;million and $2,304.9 million, respectively, are included in
reinsurance receivables. Should any of the reinsurers be unable to meet its obligation at
the time of the claim, obligation to pay such claim would remain with the Company. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had paid $53.3 million and $45.5 million,
respectively, of ceded benefits which are recoverable from reinsurers. In addition, at
December 31, 2003, the Company had receivables of $66.6 million related to insurance
assumed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2002, the Company discovered that it had overpaid reinsurance premiums to several
reinsurance companies of approximately $94.5 million. At December 31, 2002, the Company
had recorded cash and receivables totaling $69.7 million, which reflected the amounts
received and the Company&#146;s then current estimate of amounts to be recovered in the
future, based upon the information available. The corresponding increase in premiums and
policy fees resulted in $62.5 million of additional amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs in 2002. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs took into
account the amortization relating to the increase in premiums and policy fees as well as
the additional amortization required should the remainder of the overpayment not be
collected. In 2003, the Company substantially completed its recovery of the reinsurance
overpayments. As a result, the Company increased premiums and policy fees by $18.4 million
in 2003. The increase in premiums and policy fees resulted in $6.1 million of additional
amortization of deferred policy acquisitions costs. As a result of the recoveries income
before income tax increased $12.3 million and $7.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s unaudited consolidated quarterly operating data for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, are presented below. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of
quarterly results have been reflected in the data which follow. It is also
management&#146;s opinion, however, that quarterly operating data for insurance
enterprises are not indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding quarters or years.
In order to obtain a more accurate indication of performance, there should be a review of
operating results, changes in share-owners&#146; equity, and cash flows for a period of
several quarters. Certain reclassifications have been made in previously reported
quarterly data to make the amounts comparable to those of the fourth quarter of 2003. Such
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On January 1, 2001, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, &#147;Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos.
137 and 138, requires the Company to record all derivative financial instruments at fair
value on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value of a derivative instrument are reported
in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the designated use of the
derivative instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a cumulative charge to net
income, net of income tax, of $7.6 million on January 1, 2001. The charge to net income
primarily resulted from the recognition of derivative instruments embedded in the
Company&#146;s corporate bond portfolio. In addition, the charge to net income includes
the recognition of the ineffectiveness on existing hedging relationships including the
difference in spot and forward exchange rates related to foreign currency swaps used as an
economic hedge of foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts. The adoption of
SFAS No. 133 has introduced volatility into the Company&#146;s reported net income and
other comprehensive income depending on future market conditions and the Company&#146;s
hedging activities. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On January 1, 2003, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 145, &#147;Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002.&#148; SFAS No. 145
rescinds SFAS No. 4, which required companies to treat the extinguishments of debt as an
extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 requires companies to apply APB Opinion No. 30 when
determining the accounting for the extinguishments of debt. The statement also rescinds
and amends other statements to make various technical corrections and clarifications. SFAS
No. 145 requires the Company to restate previously issued financial statements to
reclassify losses related to the early extinguishments of debt from extraordinary losses
to operating expenses. The Company&#146;s 2002 financial statements have been
reclassified, in accordance with SFAS No. 145, to reflect the $2.2 million charge, which
resulted from the redemption of subordinated debentures, in income from continuing
operations. </FONT></P>
