<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Protective Life Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>
