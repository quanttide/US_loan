Life Marketing segment markets level premium term and term-like insurance, universal life,
variable universal life and &#147;bank owned life insurance&#148; (BOLI) products on a
national basis. The segment uses several methods of distribution for its products. One
distribution system is comprised of brokerage general agencies who recruit a network of
independent life agents. The segment also distributes insurance products through a network
of experienced independent personal producing general agents who are recruited by regional
sales managers. Also, the Company markets BOLI through an independent marketing
organization that specializes in this market. The segment also distributes life insurance
products through stockbrokers and banks, and through direct response and worksite

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acquisitions
segment focuses on acquiring, converting, and servicing policies acquired from other
companies. The segment&#146;s primary focus is on life insurance policies sold to
individuals. These acquisitions may be accomplished through acquisitions of companies or
through the reinsurance of blocks of policies from other insurers. Forty-three
transactions have been closed by the segment since 1970, including 16 since 1989. Policies
acquired through the segment are usually administered as &#147;closed&#148; blocks; i.e.,
no new policies are being marketed. Therefore, the amount of insurance in force for a
particular acquisition is expected to decline with time due to lapses and deaths of the
insureds. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
acquisitions closed by the Acquisitions segment do not include the acquisition of an
active sales force. In transactions where some marketing activity was included, the
Company generally either ceased future marketing efforts or redirected those efforts to
another segment of the Company. However, in the case of the acquisition of West Coast Life
Insurance Company (West Coast) which was closed by the Acquisitions segment in 1997, the
Company elected to continue the marketing of new policies and operate West Coast as a
component of the Company&#146;s Life Marketing segment. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company believes that it&#146;s focused and disciplined approach to the acquisition
process and its experience in the assimilation, conservation, and servicing of acquired
policies give it a significant competitive advantage over many other companies that
attempt to make similar acquisitions. The Company expects acquisition opportunities to
continue to be available as the life insurance industry continues to consolidate; however,
management believes that the Company may face increased competition for future
acquisitions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total
revenues and income before income tax from the Acquisitions segment are expected to
decline with time unless new acquisitions are made. Therefore, the segment&#146;s revenues
and earnings may fluctuate from year to year depending upon the level of acquisition
activity. </FONT></P>

2001, the Company coinsured a block of individual life policies from Standard Insurance
Company, and acquired the stock of Inter-State Assurance Company (Inter-State) and First
Variable Life Insurance Company (First Variable) from ILona Financial Group, Inc., the
U.S. subsidiary of Irish Life &amp; Permanent plc of Dublin, Ireland. In 2002, the Company
coinsured a block of traditional life and interest-sensitive life insurance policies from
Conseco Variable Insurance Company. Although acquisition opportunities were investigated,
no transactions were completed in 1999, 2000, or 2003. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s fixed annuities are primarily modified guaranteed annuities which guarantee
an interest rate for a fixed period. Because contract values are &#147;market-value
adjusted&#148; upon surrender prior to maturity, these products afford the Company a
measure of protection from the effects of changes in interest rates. The Company also
offers variable annuities which offer the policyholder the opportunity to invest in
various investment accounts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s Stable Value Products segment markets guaranteed investment contracts
(GICs) to 401(k) and other qualified retirement savings plans. GICs are generally
contracts which specify a return on deposits for a specified period and often provide
flexibility for withdrawals at book value in keeping with the benefits provided by the
plan. The demand for GICs is related to the relative attractiveness of the &#147;fixed
rate&#148; investment option in a 401(k) plan compared to the equity-based investment
options available to plan participants. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
segment also markets fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees
of municipal bond proceeds, institutional investors, bank trust departments and money
market funds, and sells funding agreements to special purpose entities that in turn issue
notes or certificates in smaller, transferable denominations. During the fourth quarter of
2003, the Company registered a funding agreement-backed notes program with the SEC.
Through this program, the Company is able to offer notes to both institutional and retail
investors. The segment&#146;s funding agreement-backed notes complement the Company&#146;s
overall asset-liability management in that the terms of the funding agreements may be
tailored to the needs of the seller, as opposed to the needs of the buyer, and more so in
a retail program. The segment had sales of $450 million under this program in 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s emphasis is on a consistent and disciplined approach to product pricing and
asset/liability management, careful underwriting of early withdrawal risks and maintaining
low distribution and administration costs. Most GIC contracts and funding agreements
written by the Company have maturities of three to seven years. </FONT></P>

securities. Mortgage-backed securities are constructed from pools of residential
mortgages, and may have cash flow volatility as a result of changes in the rate at which
prepayments of principal occur with respect to the underlying loans. Prepayments of
principal on the underlying residential loans can be expected to accelerate with decreases
in interest rates and diminish with increases in interest rates. The Company has not
invested in the higher risk tranches of mortgage-backed securities (except mortgage-backed
securities issued in securitization transactions sponsored by the Company). In addition,
the Company has entered into hedging transactions to reduce the volatility in market value
of its mortgage-backed securities. </FONT></P>

table below shows a breakdown of the Company&#146;s mortgage-backed securities portfolio
by type at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Planned amortization class securities (PACs) pay down
according to a schedule. Targeted amortization class securities (TACs) pay down in amounts
approximating a targeted schedule. Non-Accelerated Security (NAS) receive no principal
payments in the first five years, after which NAS receive an increasing percentage of pro
rata principal payments until the tenth year, after which NAS receive principal as
principal of the underlying mortgages is received. All of these types of structured
mortgage-backed securities give the Company some measure of protection against both
prepayment and extension risk. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003, approximately $12.4 billion of the Company&#146;s $13.4 billion bond
portfolio was invested in U.S. Government or agency-backed securities or investment grade
bonds and approximately $995.5 million of its fixed maturities portfolio was rated less
than investment grade, of which $407.6 million are bank loan participations and $66.9
million were securities issued in Company-sponsored commercial mortgage loan
securitizations. The Company has increased its investment in bank loan participations over
the last two years to take advantage of market conditions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks
associated with investments in less than investment grade debt obligations may be
significantly higher than risks associated with investments in debt securities rated
investment grade. Risk of loss upon default by the borrower is significantly greater with
respect to such debt obligations than with other debt securities because these obligations
may be unsecured or subordinated to other creditors. Additionally, there is often a thinly
traded market for such securities and current market quotations are frequently not
available for some of these securities. Issuers of less than investment grade debt
obligations usually have higher levels of indebtedness and are more sensitive to adverse
economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment-grade
issuers. </FONT></P>

Company also invests a significant portion of its portfolio in mortgage loans. Results for
these investments have been excellent due to careful management and a focus on a
specialized segment of the market. The Company generally does not lend on speculative
properties and has specialized in making loans on either credit-oriented commercial
properties or credit-anchored strip shopping centers. The average size of loans made
during 2003 was $3.1 million. The average size mortgage loan in the Company&#146;s
portfolio is approximately $2.2 million. The largest single loan amount is $19.6 million. </FONT></P>

loans are generally on strip shopping centers anchored by one or more regional or national
retail stores. The anchor tenants enter into long-term leases with the Company&#146;s
borrowers. These centers provide the basic necessities of life, such as food,

Company&#146;s mortgage lending criteria generally require that the loan-to-value ratio on
each mortgage be at or under 75% at the time of origination. Projected rental payments
from credit anchors (i.e., excluding rental payments from smaller local tenants) generally
exceed 70% of the property&#146;s projected operating expenses and debt service. The
Company also offers a commercial loan product under which the Company will permit a
loan-to-value ratio of up to 85% in exchange for a participating interest in the cash
flows from the underlying real estate. Approximately $382.7 million of the Company&#146;s
mortgage loans have this participation feature. </FONT></P>

of the Company&#146;s mortgage loans have call or interest rate reset provisions between 3
and 10 years. However, if interest rates were to significantly increase, the Company may
be unable to call the loans or increase the interest rates on its existing mortgage loans
commensurate with the significantly increased market rates. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003, $11.8 million or 0.4% of the mortgage loan portfolio was nonperforming.
It is the Company&#146;s policy to cease to carry accrued interest on loans that are over
90 days delinquent. For loans less than 90 days delinquent, interest is accrued unless it
is determined that the accrued interest is not collectible. If a loan becomes over 90 days
delinquent, it is the Company&#146;s general policy to initiate foreclosure proceedings
unless a workout arrangement to bring the loan current is in place. </FONT></P>

1996, the Company sold approximately $554 million of its mortgage loans in a
securitization transaction. In 1997, the Company sold approximately $445 million of its
loans in a second securitization transaction. In 1998 the Company securitized $146 million
of its mortgage loans and in 1999 the Company securitized $263 million. The
securitizations&#146; senior tranches were sold, and the Company retained the junior
tranches. The Company continues to service the securitized mortgage loans. At December 31,
2003, the Company had investments related to retained beneficial interests of mortgage
loan securitizations of $283.6 million. </FONT></P>

a general rule, the Company does not invest directly in real estate. The investment real
estate held by the Company consists largely of properties obtained through foreclosures or
the acquisition of other insurance companies. In the Company&#146;s experience, the
appraised value of a foreclosed property often approximates the mortgage loan balance on
the property plus costs of foreclosure. Also, foreclosed properties often generate a
positive cash flow enabling the Company to hold and manage the property until the property
can be profitably sold. </FONT></P>

underwriting policies of the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are established by
management. With respect to individual insurance, the subsidiaries use information from
the application and, in some cases, inspection reports, attending physician statements, or
medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued as applied for, rated,
or rejected. Medical examinations of applicants are required for individual life insurance
in excess of certain prescribed amounts (which vary based on the type of insurance) and
for most individual insurance applied for by applicants over age 50. In the case of
&#147;simplified issue&#148; policies, which are issued primarily through the Asset
Protection segment and the Life Marketing segment in the payroll deduction market,
coverage is rejected if the responses to certain health questions contained in the
application indicate adverse health of the applicant. For other than &#147;simplified
issue&#148; policies, medical examinations are requested of any applicant, regardless of
age and amount of requested coverage, if an examination is deemed necessary to underwrite
the risk. Substandard risks may be referred to reinsurers for full or partial reinsurance
of the substandard risk. </FONT></P>

on the applicant&#146;s age, except in the worksite and BOLI markets where no blood
testing is required. Blood samples are tested for a wide range of chemical values and are
screened for antibodies to the HIV virus. Applications also contain questions permitted by
law regarding the HIV virus which must be answered by the proposed insureds. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries cede insurance to other insurance companies. The
ceding insurance company remains liable with respect to ceded insurance should any
reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed by it. The Company sets a limit on the
amount of insurance retained on the life of any one person. In the individual lines it
will not retain more than $500,000, including accidental death benefits, on any one life.
In many cases the retention is less. At December 31, 2003, the Company had insurance in
force of $346.5 billion of which approximately $292.7 billion was ceded to reinsurers. </FONT></P>

the past several years, the Company&#146;s reinsurers have reduced the net cost of
reinsurance to the Company. Consequently, the Company has increased the amount of
reinsurance which it cedes on newly-written individual life insurance policies, and has

Acquisitions business segments. </FONT></P>

applicable insurance laws under which the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries operate
require that each insurance company report policy liabilities to meet future obligations
on the outstanding policies. These liabilities are the amounts which, with the additional
premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates,
are calculated in accordance with applicable law to be sufficient to meet the various
policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the liabilities
shall not be less than liabilities calculated using certain named mortality tables and

policy liabilities and accruals carried in the Company&#146;s financial reports presented
on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP) differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the
insurance subsidiaries&#146; statutory financial statements (presented on the basis of
statutory accounting principles mandated by state insurance regulations). For policy
liabilities other than those for universal life policies, annuity contracts, GICs, and
funding agreements, these differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables
and interest rate assumptions which are deemed to be more appropriate for financial
reporting purposes than those required for statutory accounting purposes; from the
introduction of lapse assumptions into the calculation; and from the use of the net level
premium method on all business. Policy liabilities for universal life policies, annuity
contracts, GICs, and funding agreements are carried in the Company&#146;s financial
reports at the account value of the policy or contract plus accrued interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing
federal laws and regulations affect the taxation of the Company&#146;s products. Income
tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation
period of certain life insurance and annuity products. Congress has from time to time
considered proposals that, if enacted, would have had an adverse impact on the federal
income tax treatment of such products, or would increase the tax-deferred status of
competing products. In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate tax
obligations. Legislation has recently been enacted that would over time, reduce and
eventually eliminate the estate tax. If the estate tax is significantly reduced or
eliminated, the demand for certain life insurance products could be adversely affected.
The Company cannot predict what tax initiatives may be enacted which could adversely
affect the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are taxed by the federal government in a manner
similar to companies in other industries. However, certain restrictions on consolidating
recently acquired life insurance companies and on consolidating life insurance company
income with non-insurance income are applicable to the Company; thus, the Company is not
able to consolidate all of the operating results of its subsidiaries for federal income
tax purposes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
pre-1984 tax law, certain income of the Company was not taxed currently, but was
accumulated in a memorandum account designated as &#147;Policyholders&#146; Surplus&#148;
to be taxed only when such income was distributed to share owners or when certain limits
on accumulated amounts were exceeded. Consistent with current tax law, amounts accumulated
in Policyholders&#146; Surplus have been carried forward, although no accumulated income
may be added to these accounts. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate accumulation in the
Policyholders&#146; Surplus account was $70.5 million. Under current income tax laws, the
Company does not anticipate paying income tax on amounts in the Policyholders&#146;
Surplus accounts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life
and health insurance is a mature industry. In recent years, the industry has experienced
little growth in life insurance sales, though the aging population has increased the
demand for retirement savings products. Life and health insurance is a highly competitive
industry. The Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business from
other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources than the
Company, as well as competition from other providers of financial services. Competition
could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products. </FONT></P>

insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, potentially more efficient organizations
emerging from consolidation. Participants in certain of the Company&#146;s independent
distribution channels are also consolidating into larger organizations. Some mutual
insurance companies are converting to stock ownership which will give them greater access
to capital markets. Additionally, commercial banks, insurance companies, and investment
banks may now combine, provided certain requirements are satisfied. The ability of banks
to increase their securities-related business or to affiliate with insurance companies may
materially and adversely affect sales of all of the Company&#146;s products by
substantially increasing the number and financial strength of potential competitors. </FONT></P>

capital adequacy, and is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and

life insurance company&#146;s statutory capital is computed according to rules prescribed
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as modified by the insurance
company&#146;s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and
are intended to reflect a more conservative view; for example, requiring immediate
expensing of policy acquisition costs and through the use of more conservative
computations of policy liabilities. The NAIC&#146;s risk-based capital requirements
require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based capital
formula. These requirements are intended to allow insurance regulators to identify
inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks
inherent in the insurer&#146;s operations. The formula includes components for asset risk,
liability risk, interest rate exposure, and other factors. Based upon the December 31,
2003 statutory financial reports, the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are adequately
capitalized under the formula. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual reports with
the supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business and their
business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. Under the
rules of the NAIC, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to
five years) by one or more of the supervisory agencies on behalf of the states in which
they do business. To date, no such insurance department examinations have produced any
significant adverse findings regarding any insurance company subsidiary of the Company. </FONT></P>

insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business in such a
state can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by
insolvent or failed insurance companies. Although the Company cannot predict the amount of
any future assessments, most insurance guaranty fund laws currently provide that an
assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer&#146;s financial
strength. The Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries were assessed immaterial amounts in
2003, which will be partially offset by credits against future state premium taxes. </FONT></P>

addition, many states, including the states in which the Company&#146;s insurance
subsidiaries are domiciled, have enacted legislation or adopted regulations regarding
insurance holding company systems. These laws require registration of and periodic
reporting by insurance companies domiciled within the jurisdiction which control or are
controlled by other corporations or persons so as to constitute an insurance holding
company system. These laws also affect the acquisition of control of insurance companies
as well as transactions between insurance companies and companies controlling them. Most
states, including Tennessee, where Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective Life) is
domiciled, require administrative approval of the acquisition of control of an insurance
company domiciled in the state or the acquisition of control of an insurance holding
company whose insurance subsidiary is incorporated in the state. In Tennessee, the
acquisition of 10% of the voting securities of an entity is generally deemed to be the
acquisition of control for the purpose of the insurance holding company statute and
requires not only the filing of detailed information concerning the acquiring parties and
the plan of acquisition, but also administrative approval prior to the acquisition. </FONT></P>

regulatory restrictions on the insurance subsidiaries&#146; ability to pay dividends to
Protective Life Corporation. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered
ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts are subject
to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. The maximum amount
that would qualify as ordinary dividends to Protective Life Corporation by Protective Life
in 2004 is estimated to be $293.8 million. No assurance can be given that more stringent
restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which the Company&#146;s
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled; such restrictions could have the effect, under
certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to the
Company by such subsidiaries without affirmative prior approval by state regulatory
authorities. </FONT></P>
