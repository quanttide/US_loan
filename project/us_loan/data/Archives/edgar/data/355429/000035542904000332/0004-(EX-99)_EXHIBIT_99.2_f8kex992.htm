Life Corporation (the Company) is a holding company whose subsidiaries provide financial
services through the production, distribution, and administration of insurance and
investment products. The Company operates five business segments. An operating segment is
generally distinguished by products and/or channels of distribution. The Company&#146;s
operating segments are Life Marketing, Acquisitions, Annuities, Stable Value Products, and
Asset Protection. In addition, the Company has another segment referred to as the
Corporate and Other segment. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2003, the Company&#146;s net income increased 22.4% to $217.1 million or $3.07 per diluted
share, compared to $177.4 million or $2.52 per share in 2002. Included in 2003 net income
were net realized investment gains of $0.28 per share compared to gains of $0.04 per share
in 2002. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $159.2 million in 2003, an
increase of 26.8% over the $125.6 million reported in 2002. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in business-in-force. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Acquisitions segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $95.2 million in 2003, up slightly
from the $95.1 million reported in 2002. Increased earnings from recently completed
transactions were offset by the expected declining earnings from older acquired blocks of
business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Annuities segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $13.4 million in 2003, a decline of
$2.3 million from the $15.7 million reported in 2002. The decrease is primarily due to
interest spread compression and low sales of fixed annuities caused by lower interest
rates in 2003. </FONT></P>

Value Products pretax operating income was $38.9 million in 2003, compared to $42.3

to 107 basis points in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Asset Protection segment had pretax operating income of $20.2 million in 2003, compared to
a loss of $14.8&nbsp;million in 2002. Results for the segment improved after a $25.6
million pretax charge in 2002. </FONT></P>

and Other had a pretax operating loss of $32.0 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $2.9
million in 2002. The loss in 2003 was a result of charges recorded of $28.4 million due to
negative trends in used vehicle prices affecting the segment&#146;s residual value
product. In addition, a $3.0&nbsp;million increase in interest expense contributed to this
decline. </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s accounting policies inherently require the use of judgments relating to a
variety of assumptions and estimates, in particular expectations of current and future
mortality, morbidity, persistency, expenses, and interest rates. Because of the inherent
uncertainty when using the assumptions and estimates, the effect of certain accounting
policies under different conditions or assumptions could be materially different from
those reported in the consolidated financial statements. A discussion of the various
critical accounting policies is presented below. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new insurance business.
These costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business
and coinsurance of blocks of policies, are deferred. The recovery of such costs is
dependent on the future profitability of the related policies. The amount of future profit
is dependent principally on investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and
expenses to administer the business and certain economic variables, such as inflation.
These factors enter into management&#146;s estimates of future profits which generally are
used to amortize certain of such costs. Accounting for other intangible assets such as
goodwill also requires an estimate of the future profitability of the associated lines of
business. Revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the
reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the
asset and a charge to income if estimated future profits are less than the unamortized
deferred amounts. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has a deferred policy acquisition costs asset of approximately $99.7 million
related to its variable annuity product line with an account balance of $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. The Company monitors the rate of amortization of the deferred policy
acquisition costs associated with its variable annuity product line. The methodologies
employ varying assumptions about how much and how quickly the stock markets will
appreciate. The primary assumptions used to project future profits as part of the analysis
include: a long-term equity market growth rate of 9%, reversion to the mean methodology
with a reversion to the mean cap rate of 14%, reversion to the mean period of 5 years, and
an amortization period of 20 years. A recovery in equity markets, or methodologies and
assumptions that anticipate a recovery, results in lower amounts of amortization, and a
worsening of equity markets results in higher amounts of amortization. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing
an adequate liability for the Company&#146;s obligations to its policyholders requires the
use of assumptions. Liabilities for future policy benefits on traditional life insurance
products require the use of assumptions relative to future investment yields, mortality,
persistency and other assumptions based on the Company&#146;s historical experience,
modified as necessary to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible
adverse deviation. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company also establishes liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) on its
variable annuity products. The methods used to estimate the liabilities employ assumptions
about mortality and the performance of equity markets. The Company assumes mortality of
60% of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 1994 Variable Annuity GMDB
Mortality Table to reflect improvements in mortality since the table was derived and other
factors. Future declines in the equity market would increase the Company&#146;s GMDB
liability. Differences between the actual experience and the assumptions used result in
variances in profit and could result in losses. The Company&#146;s GMDB at December 31,
2003, are subject to a dollar-for-dollar reduction upon withdrawal of related annuity
deposits on contracts issued prior to January&nbsp;1, 2003. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining
whether a decline in the current fair value of invested assets is an other-than-temporary
decline in value can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates, particularly for
investments that are not actively traded in established markets. For example, assessing
the value of certain investments requires the Company to perform an analysis of expected
future cash flows or rates of prepayments. Other investments, such as collateralized
mortgage or bond obligations, represent selected tranches of a structured transaction,
supported overall by underlying investments in a wide variety of issuers. The
Company&#146;s specific accounting policies related to its invested assets are discussed
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company utilizes derivative transactions primarily in order to reduce its exposure to
interest rate risk as well as currency exchange risk. Assessing the effectiveness of these
hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often
involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. The Company employs a variety of methods
for determining the fair value of its derivative instruments. The fair values of interest
rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, total return swaps and put or call options are based
upon industry standard models which present-value the projected cash flows of the
derivatives using current and implied future market conditions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining
the Company&#146;s obligations to employees under its defined benefit pension plan and
stock-based compensation plans requires the use of estimates. The calculation of the
liability related to the Company&#146;s defined benefit pension plan requires assumptions
regarding the appropriate weighted average discount rate, estimated rate of increase in
the compensation of its employees and the expected long-term rate of return on the
plan&#146;s assets. Accounting for other stock-based compensation plans may require the
use of option pricing models to estimate the Company&#146;s obligations. Assumptions used
in such models relate to equity market volatility, the risk-free interest rate at the date
of grant, as well as the expected exercise date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
assessment of potential obligations for tax, regulatory, and litigation matters inherently
involve a variety of estimates of potential future outcomes. The Company makes such
estimates after consultation with its advisors and a review of available facts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums
and policy fees were $810.3 million in 2002, an increase of $191.7 million, or 31.0% from
the $618.7&nbsp;million reported for 2001. During 2002, the Company discovered that it had
overpaid the reinsurance premiums due on certain life insurance policies over a period of
10 years. The Company recorded cash and receivables totaling $69.7&nbsp;million, and a
corresponding increase in premiums and policy fees, which reflected its then current
estimate of amounts to be recovered. Excluding this increase, premiums and policy fees in
the Life Marketing segment increased $29.5 million due to an increase in sales. Premiums
and policy fees in the Acquisitions segment are expected to decline with time (due to the
lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or terminations of coverage) unless
new acquisitions are made. In June 2002, the Company coinsured a block of insurance
policies from Conseco Variable Insurance Company (Conseco). This transaction resulted in
an increase in premiums and policy fees of $18.8 million. The acquisition of Inter-State
and First Variable resulted in a $27.0 million increase in premiums and policy fees.
Premiums and policy fees from older acquired blocks decreased $3.7 million. Premiums and
policy fees from the Annuities segment declined $2.3 million due to a decline in variable
annuity management fees caused by the general decline in the equity markets. Premiums and
policy fees related to the Asset Protection segment increased $49.9 million due to
continued higher sales in its service contracts lines. Lower sales in
other Asset Protection lines during 2002 were more than offset by a decline in the amount
of reinsurance ceded. The decline in reinsurance ceded was primarily due to a change in
the form of a credit reinsurance agreement in 2002. Premiums and policy fees relating to
various lines in the Corporate and Other segment increased $2.9 million. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums
and policy fees were $735.9 million in 2003, a decrease of $74.4 million or 9.2% from 2002
premiums and policy fees. In 2003, the Company substantially completed its recovery of all
of the previously mentioned reinsurance overpayments. As a result, $18.4 million of
premiums and policy fees were recorded in 2003 related to the collection of the
reinsurance overpayment. Overall, premiums and policy fees in the Life Marketing segment
declined $21.5 million from 2002, reflecting an increase in the use of reinsurance.
Premiums and policy fees from the Conseco transaction resulted in an increase of $7.2
million. Premiums and policy fees from older acquired blocks decreased $17.8 million as a
result of normal lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or terminations of
coverage. Premiums and policy fees in the Annuities segment increased by $0.4 million in
2003. Premiums and policy fees in the Asset Protection segment decreased by
$41.4&nbsp;million due to reduced credit earned premiums attributable to lower sales and
the termination of non-core lines of business. Premiums and policy fees in the Corporate
and Other segment decreased by $1.4 million. </FONT></P>

acquisition of Inter-State and First Variable resulted in an increase in investment income
of $57.5 million in 2002. The Conseco coinsurance transaction resulted in an increase in

other-than-temporary impairments. Management analyzes various factors to determine if any
specific other than temporary asset impairments exist. Once a determination has been made
that a specific other-than-temporary impairment exists, a realized loss is recognized and
the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value. An
other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized based upon all relevant facts and
circumstances for each investment. With respect to unrealized losses due to
issuer-specific events, the Company considers the creditworthiness and financial
performance of the issuer and other available information. With respect to unrealized
losses that are not due to issuer-specific events, such as losses due to interest rate
fluctuations, general market conditions or industry-related events, the Company considers
its intent and ability to hold the investment to allow for a market recovery or to
maturity together with an assessment of the likelihood of full recovery. See also

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with the Company&#146;s segment reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, management evaluates the results of the Company&#146;s segments on a
before-income-tax basis as adjusted for certain items which management believes are not
indicative of the Company&#146;s core operations. Segment operating income (loss) excludes
net realized investment gains and losses and the related amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and gains (losses) on derivative instruments because fluctuations in
these items are due to changes in interest rates and other financial market factors
instead of mortality and morbidity. Periodic settlements of interest rate swaps associated
with corporate debt and certain investments are included in realized gains and losses but
are considered part of operating income because the interest rate swaps are hedging items
affecting operating income. Also, segment operating income (loss) excludes any net gains
or losses on disposals of businesses, discontinued operations, and the cumulative effect
of changes in accounting principles. Although the items excluded from segment operating
income (loss) may be significant components in understanding and assessing the
Company&#146;s overall financial performance, management believes that operating segment
income (loss) enhances an investor&#146;s understanding of the Company&#146;s results of
operations by highlighting the income (loss) attributable to the normal, recurring
operations of the insurance business (i.e., mortality and morbidity), consistent with
industry practice. However, the Company&#146;s segment operating income (loss) measures
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Segment
operating income (loss) should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss)
determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP). &#147;Total income from continuing operations before income
tax&#148; is a GAAP measure to which the non-GAAP measure &#147;total operating
income&#148; may be compared. Unlike total operating income, total income before income
tax includes net realized investment gains and losses, the related amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs and gains (losses) on derivative instruments. In the
Annuities and Stable Value Products segments operating income excludes realized investment
gains and losses and related amortization. In the Corporate and Other segment operating
income includes derivative gains related to corporate debt and investments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Life Marketing segment&#146;s 2002 pretax operating income was $125.6 million, $36.0
million above 2001. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company discovered that it had
overpaid the reinsurance premiums due on certain life insurance policies, and indicated
that it would be seeking recovery of approximately $94.5 million from several reinsurance
companies. At December, 31, 2002, the Company had recorded cash and receivables totaling
$69.7 million, which reflected the amounts received at that date, and the Company&#146;s
estimate of amounts to be recovered in the future, based upon the information then
available. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
corresponding increase in premiums and policy fees resulted in $62.5 million of additional
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in 2002. The amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs took into account the amortization relating to the increase in
premiums and policy fees as well as the additional amortization required should the
remainder of the overpayment not be collected. The Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax
operating income thereby increased $7.2 million which is the difference between the
premiums recorded and the amount of such additional amortization. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the overpayments were made over a period of 10 years beginning in 1992, and had the effect
of reducing the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs during that period, the
Company believes that no prior period results were materially understated and that no
operating trends were materially affected as a result. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the increase from reinsurance recoveries, an increase of $7.2 million in 2002
is attributable to favorable mortality experience, and an increase of $21.6 million can be
attributed to growth through sales. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Life Marketing segment&#146;s 2003 pretax operating income was $159.2 million, an increase
of $33.6 million over 2002. During 2003, the Company received payment from substantially
all of the affected reinsurance companies. As a result the Company increased premiums and
policy fees by $18.4 million and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs by $6.1
million, resulting in an increase in the Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax operating
income of $12.3 million. The remaining increase is attributable to growth of
business-in-force due to strong sales in 2002 and 2003 and favorable expense variances as
compared to pricing allowances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the ordinary course of business, the Acquisitions segment regularly considers acquisitions
of blocks of policies or smaller insurance companies. Policies acquired through the
segment are usually administered as &#147;closed&#148; blocks; i.e., no new policies are
being marketed. Therefore, earnings from the Acquisitions segment are normally expected to
decline over time (due to the lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or
terminations of coverage) unless new acquisitions are made. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2002, the segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $95.1 million, $27.1 million above
2001. The Conseco and Standard coinsurance transactions and the acquisition of Inter-State
and First Variable resulted in a $24.7 million increase in earnings in 2002. Earnings on
older acquired blocks of policies increased $2.4 million. In 2003, the segment&#146;s
pretax operating income was $95.2 million, $0.1 million above 2002. The Conseco
transaction contributed a $9.1 million increase in earnings over 2002, and earnings from
older acquired blocks of business decreased by $9.0 million. </FONT></P>

Annuities segment&#146;s pretax operating income for 2002 was $15.7 million as compared to
$16.9 million in 2001. Fixed annuity earnings increased $1.2 million due to higher account
balances. This increase was more than offset by a decline in variable annuity earnings of
$2.4 million due to the general decline in the equity markets. The segment&#146;s 2003
pretax operating income was $13.4 million, a decrease of $2.3 million from 2002. The
decrease is primarily attributable to spread compression and the inability to capitalize
excess expenses due to lower sales of fixed annuities caused by lower interest rates in
2003. The segment had a $0.3 million realized investment gain (net of related amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs) in 2002 and a $3.8 million gain in 2003. As a
result, total pretax income was $16.0 million in 2002 and $17.2 million in 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company offers a guaranteed minimum death benefit feature (GMDB) on its variable annuity
products. The Company&#146;s accounting policy has been to calculate its total exposure to
GMDB, and then apply a mortality factor to determine the amount of claims that could be
expected to occur in the coming twelve months. The Company then accrues to that amount
over four quarters. At December 31, 2003, the total GMDB reserve was $5.1 million. The
total guaranteed amount payable under the GMDB feature based on variable annuity account
balances at December 31, 2003, was $287.0&nbsp;million, a decrease of $252.0 million from
December 31, 2002, caused by an improvement in the equity markets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory
authorities (which require the assumption that equity markets will significantly worsen),
the Annuities segment reported GMDB related policy liabilities and accruals of $12.1
million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of $12.6 million from December 31, 2002. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
positive performance in the equity markets in 2003 allowed the Company to decrease its
GMDB related policy liabilities, the Annuities segment&#146;s future results may be
negatively affected by a slow economy. Volatile equity markets could negatively affect
sales of variable annuities and the fees the segment assesses on variable annuity
contracts. Lower interest rates have negatively affected sales of fixed annuities. In this
segment, equity market volatility may create uncertainty regarding the level of future
profitability in the variable annuity business and the related rate of amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs. </FONT></P>

Stable Value Products segment&#146;s 2002 pretax operating income was $42.3 million, $9.1
million above 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher average account balances and
operating spreads. Average account balances were $3.9 billion in 2002 as compared to $3.5
billion in 2001. Operating spreads averaged 107 basis points in 2002 compared to an
average of 90 basis points in 2001. The segment&#146;s 2003 pretax operating income was
$38.9 million, a decrease of $3.4&nbsp;million from 2002. Average operating spreads were
down to 96 basis points in 2003, causing the decrease in pretax operating income. The
primary reason for the spread compression was a reduction in yield caused by the high
level of prepayments in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio in 2003. The segments
average quarterly account balances increased by $189.6 million in 2003 to $4.1 billion.
The segment had realized investment losses in 2002 of $7.1 million compared to gains of
$9.8 million in 2003. As a result, total income before income tax was $35.2 million in
2002 and $48.7 million in 2003. </FONT></P>

million lower than the pretax operating income of $36.3 million in 2001. The decrease
included the $25.6 million charge discussed above. The segment also experienced lower
service contract administration fees of $2.8 million and lower earned credit premiums that
reduced income $5.8 million. Higher loss ratios in the vehicle service contract line
lowered earnings $2.8 million. Also, higher loss ratios in the segment&#146;s ancillary
lines led to higher losses of $5.2 million in 2002. Included in the segment&#146;s pretax
loss for 2002 was $2.7 million of income related to the sale of the inactive charter of a
small subsidiary compared to $2.0 million for a charter sale in 2001. In addition, 2001
operating income included a change in estimate of $6.7 million related to reserves in
certain credit lines. All other items decreased 2002 operating income by $3.0 million. </FONT></P>

the segment&#146;s core lines of business was $17.0 million in 2003 as compared to $18.4
million in 2002. Lower credit insurance results in 2003, caused by reduced sales, were
partially offset by improved results on service contract lines in 2003. The vehicle
service contract line of business improved to contribute pretax operating income of $3.7
million in 2003, as compared to a pretax operating loss of $2.8 million in 2002, due to
improving loss ratios caused by the affect of increasing prices in 2000 through 2003. The
marine service contract line&#146;s pretax operating income improved to $6.0 million in
2003, $1.2 million better than in 2002. Other continuing lines of business contributed
$7.3 million of pretax operating income. Included in the pretax operating loss in 2003,
was the sale of an inactive charter which contributed $6.9 million of income. All other
items decreased operating income by $7.0 million in 2003. </FONT></P>

Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of net investment income and expenses not
attributable to other segments (including net investment income on unallocated capital and

auto residual value line of business in this segment has been significantly affected by
trends in used vehicle prices. In 2002, as a result of the negative trends, the Company
took a pretax charge of $5.3 million in the auto residual value line of business. In 2003,
the negative trends in used vehicle prices continued to negatively affect the segment, and
the Company took a pretax charge of $28.4 million. Examples of the negative trends
affecting the segment are lower used vehicle prices resulting from new vehicle sales
incentives and an increase in residual value claims on automobiles. Claims experience
studies are necessarily complex and involve analyzing and interpreting large quantities of
data to deduce whether the trends appear to be temporary and likely to reverse, or not.
Any adverse development in the trends of used vehicle prices or in service contract claims
could have a material adverse effect on the Company. </FONT></P>

$13.2 million loss in 2001. The change primarily relates to a $12.8 million increase in
net settlements on derivatives relating to corporate debt and investments in 2002 as
compared to 2001, a $10.9 million increase in investment income allocated to the segment,
and $0.6 million lower corporate expenses. These increases were partially offset by the

line of business, a $1.3 million increase in interest expense, a $2.2 million charge for
the early extinguishment of debt, and $4.3 million less income from the cancer line of

residual value line decreased $23.2 million from 2002. Other decreases in pretax operating
income included a $3.0 million increase in interest expense, a $2.0 million decrease in

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life
and health insurance is a mature industry. In recent years, the industry has experienced
little growth in life insurance sales, though the aging population has increased the
demand for retirement savings products. Life and health insurance is a highly competitive
industry. The Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business from
other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources than the
Company, as well as competition from other providers of financial services. Competition
could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products. </FONT></P>

insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, potentially more efficient organizations
emerging from consolidation. Participants in certain of the Company&#146;s independent
distribution channels are also consolidating into larger organizations. Some mutual
insurance companies are converting to stock ownership, which will give them greater access
to capital markets. Additionally, commercial banks, insurance companies, and investment
banks may now combine, provided certain requirements are satisfied. The ability of banks
to increase their securities-related business or to affiliate with insurance companies may
materially and adversely affect sales of all of the Company&#146;s products by
substantially increasing the number and financial strength of potential competitors. </FONT></P>

organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers,

companies have occurred with increasing frequency. A downgrade in the rating of the
Company&#146;s subsidiaries could adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to sell its

Specifically, a ratings downgrade would materially harm the Company&#146;s ability to sell

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rating
organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate
to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization,
general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company&#146;s control. In
addition, rating organizations use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a
rated company, and from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion,
altered the models. Changes to the models could impact the rating organizations&#146;
judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. The Company cannot predict
what actions the rating organizations may take, or what actions the Company may be
required to take in response to the actions of the rating organizations, which could
adversely affect the Company. </FONT></P>

insurance policies were incorrectly entered into its reinsurance administrative system in

beginning in 1992. The Company has received payment from substantially all of the affected

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), income tax payable
by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation period of
certain life insurance and annuity products. This favorable tax treatment may give certain
of the Company&#146;s products a competitive advantage over other non-insurance products.
To the extent that the Code is revised to reduce the tax-deferred status of life insurance
and annuity products, or to increase the tax-deferred status of competing products, all
life insurance companies, including the Company and its subsidiaries, would be adversely
affected with respect to their ability to sell such products, and, depending upon
grandfathering provisions, would be affected by the surrenders of existing annuity
contracts and life insurance policies. For example, changes in laws or regulations could
restrict or eliminate the advantages of certain corporate or bank-owned life insurance
products. Recent changes in tax law, which have reduced the federal income tax rates on
corporate dividends in certain circumstances, could make the tax advantages of investing
in certain life insurance or annuity products less attractive. Additionally, changes in
tax law based on proposals to establish new tax advantaged retirement and life savings
plans, if enacted, could reduce the tax advantage of investing in certain life insurance
or annuity products. In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate
tax obligations. Legislation has been enacted that would, over time, reduce and eventually
eliminate the estate tax. If the estate tax is significantly reduced or eliminated, the
demand for certain life insurance products could be adversely affected. Additionally, the
Company is subject to the federal corporation income tax. The Company cannot predict what
changes to tax law or interpretations of existing tax law could adversely affect the

No. 133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;. SFAS
No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138, and 149, requires the Company to record all
derivative financial instruments, at fair value on the balance sheet. Changes in fair
value of a derivative instrument are reported in net income or other comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use of the derivative instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 133
resulted in a cumulative charge to net income, net of income tax, of $7.6 million ($0.11
per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and a cumulative after-tax increase to other
comprehensive income of $4.0 million on January 1, 2001. The charge to net income and
increase to other comprehensive income primarily resulted from the recognition of
derivative instruments embedded in the Company&#146;s corporate bond portfolio. In
addition, the charge to net income includes the recognition of the ineffectiveness on
existing hedging relationships including the difference in spot and forward exchange rates
related to foreign currency swaps used as an economic hedge of
foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 has

&#147;Consolidated Financial Statements,&#148; to certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated support from other parties. The effective date of FIN 46 is March&nbsp;31,
2004, for the Company. However, FIN 46 shall be applied to entities that are considered
special-purpose entities no later than as of the end of the first reporting period that
ends after December 15, 2003 (December 31, 2003, for the Company). As such, the Company
consolidated, as of December 31, 2003, a special-purpose entity whose investments are
managed by the Company. The special-purpose entity was consolidated based on the
determination that the Company was its primary beneficiary. The consolidation resulted in
the Company&#146;s reported assets and liabilities increasing by $430.6 million with an
immaterial impact on the results of operations. The increase in assets was the result of
the entity&#146;s $430.6 million investment portfolio, while the increase in liabilities
was due to $400.0 million of notes payable (reported in &#147;liabilities related to
variable interest entities&#148;), $15.0 million of derivative liabilities (reported in
&#147;other liabilities&#148;), and $15.6 million of minority interest (reported in
&#147;other liabilities&#148;). Additionally, the Company deconsolidated, as of December
31, 2003, the special-purpose entities PLC Capital Trust III and PLC Capital Trust IV
after determining the Company was not the primary beneficiary of these special-purpose
entities. The deconsolidation resulted in a $6.6 million increase to
&#147;investments&#148; and &#147;subordinate debt securities&#148;. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on entities not considered to be special-purpose
entities, which would be required to be consolidated as of March 31, 2004. Although the
Company does not expect the implementation of the provisions of FIN 46, on March 31, 2004,
to have a material impact on its results of operations, had the provisions been effective
at December 31, 2003, the Company&#146;s reported assets and liabilities would have
increased by approximately $109 million. </FONT></P>

October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. B36,
&#147;Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That
Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the
Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments&#148; (DIG B36). DIG B36 requires
the bifurcation of embedded derivatives within certain modified coinsurance and funds
withheld coinsurance arrangements that expose the creditor to credit risk of a company
other than the debtor, even if the debtor owns as investment assets the third-party
securities to which the creditor is exposed. The adoption did not have a material impact
on the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>

July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 03-1, &#147;Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.&#148; SOP 03-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2003. SOP 03-1 provides
guidance related to the reporting and disclosure of certain insurance contracts and
separate accounts, including the calculation of guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB).
SOP 03-1 also addresses the capitalization and amortization of sales inducements to
contract holders. Had the provision been effective at December 31, 2003, the Company would
have reported a GMDB accrual $0.3 million higher than currently reported. Although the
original intent of SOP 03-1 was to address the accounting for contract provisions not
addressed by SFAS No. 97, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits within a variable
annuity contract, it appears that SOP 03-1 contains language that may impact the
accounting for universal life products in a material way. The life insurance industry and
some insurance companies have filed letters with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants seeking clarification, guidance, delay and/or revision to more
appropriately reflect the underlying economic issues of universal life insurance products.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SOP 03-1 on the accounting for its
universal life products. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132, &#147;Employers&#146; Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,&#148; as revised by the FASB in December
2003. The FASB revised disclosure requirements for pension plans and other postretirement
benefit plans to require more information. The revision of SFAS No. 132 did not have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations. </FONT></P>

December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). The Medicare Act introduces a
prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees in 2006, as well as a federal
subsidy to plan sponsors that provide prescription drug benefits. In accordance with FASB
Staff Position No. 106-1, the Company has elected to defer recognizing the effects of the
Medicare Act for its postretirement plans under FASB Statement No. 106,
&#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension,&#148;
until authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is issued. The Company
anticipates that the Medicare Act will not have a material impact on the financial results
of the Company; therefore the costs reported in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements do not reflect these changes. The final accounting guidance could require
changes to previously reported information. </FONT></P>

Company&#146;s investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities (bonds
and redeemable preferred stocks) and commercial mortgage loans. The Company generally
purchases its investments with the intent to hold to maturity by purchasing investments
that match future cash flow needs. However, the Company may sell any of its investments to
maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has
classified $12.9 billion of its fixed maturities and certain other securities as

Company&#146;s investments in debt and equity securities are reported at market value, and
investments in mortgage loans are reported at amortized cost. At December 31, 2003, the
Company&#146;s fixed maturity investments (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) had a
market value of $13.4 billion, which is 4.8% above amortized cost of $12.7 billion. The
Company had $2.7 billion in mortgage loans at December 31, 2003. While the Company&#146;s
mortgage loans do not have quoted market values, at December 31, 2003, the Company
estimates the market value of its mortgage loans to be $3.0&nbsp;billion (using discounted
cash flows from the next call date), which is 8.2% above amortized cost. Most of the
Company&#146;s mortgage loans have significant prepayment fees. These assets are invested
for terms approximately corresponding to anticipated future benefit payments. Thus, market
fluctuations are not expected to adversely affect liquidity. </FONT></P>

whereby securities that are held as investments are loaned to third parties for short
periods of time. The Company requires collateral of 102% of the market value of the loaned

Company&#146;s management considers a number of factors when determining the impairment
status of individual securities. These include the economic condition of various industry
segments and geographic locations and other areas of identified risks. Although it is
possible for the impairment of one investment to affect other investments, the Company
engages in ongoing risk management to safeguard against and limit any further risk to its
investment portfolio. Special attention is given to correlative risks within specific
industries, related parties and business markets. </FONT></P>

management has determined that a particular investment has suffered an
other-than-temporary impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
The Company generally considers a number of factors in determining whether the impairment
is other than temporary. These include, but are not limited to: 1) actions taken by rating
agencies, 2) default by the issuer, 3) the significance of the decline, 4) the intent and
ability of the Company to hold the investment until recovery, 5) the time period during
which the decline has occurred, 6) an economic analysis of the issuer&#146;s industry, and
7) the financial strength, liquidity, and recoverability of the issuer. Management
performs a security by security review each quarter in evaluating the need for any
other-than-temporary impairments. Although no set formula is used in this process, the
investment performance, collateral position and continued viability of the issuer are
significant measures. </FONT></P>

Company generally considers a number of factors relating to the issuer in determining the
financial strength, liquidity, and recoverability of an issuer. These include but are not
limited to: available collateral, tangible and intangible assets that might be available
to repay debt, operating cash flows, financial ratios, access to capital markets, quality
of management, market position, exposure to litigation or product warranties, and the
effect of general economic conditions on the issuer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market
values are other than temporary. These include significant changes in general economic
conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate
fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and
assumptions, commission of fraud and legislative actions. The Company continuously
monitors these factors as they relate to the investment portfolio in determining the
status of each investment. Provided below are additional facts concerning the potential
effect upon the Company&#146;s earnings should circumstances lead management to conclude
that some of the current declines in market value are other than temporary. </FONT></P>

values for private, non-traded securities are determined as follows: 1) the Company
obtains estimates from independent pricing services or 2) the Company estimates market
value based upon a comparison to quoted issues of the same issuer or issues of other

non-traded securities was $1,975.3 million at December 31, 2003, representing 11.3% of the

December 31, 2003, $21.1 million of below investment grade securities in an unrealized
loss position were securities issued in Company-sponsored commercial mortgage loan
securitizations, including $18.1 million in an unrealized loss position greater than five
years. The Company does not consider these unrealized positions to be other than
temporary, because the underlying mortgage loans continue to perform consistently with the
Company&#146;s original expectations. </FONT></P>

hold securities until maturity, the Company may change its position as a result of a
change in circumstances. Any such decision is consistent with the Company&#146;s
classification of all but a specific portion of its investment portfolio as available for
sale. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company sold securities in an
unrealized loss position with a market value of $524.8 million resulting in a realized

the ordinary course of its commercial mortgage lending operations, the Company will commit
to provide a mortgage loan before the property to be mortgaged has been built or acquired.
The mortgage loan commitment is a contractual obligation to fund a mortgage loan when
called upon by the borrower. The commitment is not recognized in the Company&#146;s
financial statements until the commitment is actually funded. The mortgage loan commitment
contains terms, including the rate of interest, which may be less than prevailing interest
rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company uses a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative financial
instruments, primarily to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk as well as currency
exchange risk. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combinations
of interest rate swap contracts, futures contracts, and option contracts are sometimes
used to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks, including those related
to changes in interest rates for certain investments, primarily outstanding mortgage loan
commitments and mortgage-backed securities. Interest rate swap contracts generally involve
the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a
common notional principal amount and maturity date. Interest rate futures generally
involve exchange traded contracts to buy or sell treasury bonds and notes in the future at
specified prices. Interest rate options allow the holder of the option to receive cash or
purchase, sell or enter into a financial instrument at a specified price within a
specified period of time. The Company used interest rate swap contracts, swaptions
(options to enter into interest rate swap contracts), caps, and floors to modify the
interest characteristics of certain investments, its Senior Notes, Medium-Term Notes, and
subordinated debt securities. Swap contracts are also used to alter the effective
durations of assets and liabilities. The Company uses foreign currency swaps to reduce its
exposure to currency exchange risk on certain stable value contracts denominated in
foreign currencies, primarily the European euro and the British pound. </FONT></P>

the market risk associated with interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by
establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degrees of risk that may be
undertaken. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures involve the monitoring
of asset and liability durations for various product lines; cash flow testing under
various interest rate scenarios; and the continuous rebalancing of assets and liabilities
with respect to yield, risk, and cash flow characteristics. It is the Company&#146;s
policy to generally maintain asset and liability durations within one-half year of one
another, although, from time to time, a broader interval may be allowed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company believes its asset/liability management programs and procedures and certain
product features provide protection for the Company against the effects of changes in
interest rates under various scenarios. Additionally, the Company believes its
asset/liability management programs and procedures provide sufficient liquidity to enable
it to fulfill its obligation to pay benefits under its various insurance and deposit
contracts. However, the Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures
incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term interest
rates (i.e., the slope of the yield curve), relationships between risk-adjusted and
risk-free interest rates, market liquidity and other factors, and the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures may be negatively
affected whenever actual results differ from those assumptions. </FONT></P>

outflows related to stable value contracts (primarily maturing contracts, scheduled
interest payments, and expected withdrawals) were approximately $1,100.1 million during
2003. Cash outflows related to stable value contracts are estimated to be approximately
$1,106.1 million in 2004. The Company&#146;s asset/liability management programs and
procedures take into account maturing contracts and expected withdrawals. Accordingly, the
Company does not expect stable value contract related cash outflows to have an unusual
effect on the future operations and liquidity of the Company. </FONT></P>

the Company generally anticipates that the cash flow of its subsidiaries will be
sufficient to meet their investment commitments and operating cash needs, the Company
recognizes that investment commitments scheduled to be funded may, from time to time,
exceed the funds then available. Therefore, the Company has arranged sources of credit for
its insurance subsidiaries to use when needed. The Company expects that the rate received
on its investments will equal or exceed its borrowing rate. Additionally, the Company may,
from time to time, sell short-duration stable value products to complement its cash
management practices. </FONT></P>

life insurance company&#146;s statutory capital is computed according to rules prescribed
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), as modified by the
insurance company&#146;s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are intended
to reflect a more conservative view by, for example, requiring immediate expensing of
policy acquisition costs. The NAIC&#146;s risk-based capital requirements require
insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based capital
formula. The achievement of long-term growth will require growth in the statutory capital
of the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may secure additional
statutory capital through various sources, such as retained statutory earnings or equity
contributions by the Company. </FONT></P>

increases the need for life insurance. Many policyholders who once had adequate insurance
programs may increase their life insurance coverage to provide the same relative financial
benefit and protection. Higher interest rates may result in higher sales of certain of the

higher interest rates that have traditionally accompanied inflation could also affect the
Company&#146;s operations. Policy loans increase as policy loan interest rates become
relatively more attractive. As interest rates increase, disintermediation of stable value
and annuity account balances and individual life policy cash values may increase. The
market value of the Company&#146;s fixed-rate, long-term investments may decrease, the
Company may be unable to implement fully the interest rate reset and call provisions of
its mortgage loans, and the Company&#146;s ability to make attractive mortgage loans,
including participating mortgage loans, may decrease. In addition, participating mortgage
loan income may decrease. The difference between the interest rate earned on investments
and the interest rate credited to life insurance and investment products may also be
adversely affected by rising interest rates. </FONT></P>
