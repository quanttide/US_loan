Item  2.03   Creation  of  a  Direct  Financial  Obligation  of  a  Registrant.

On  December 28, 2004, the registrant entered into a Revolving Loan and Security
Agreement  (the  "Agreement")  with  Mr.  Michael  D. Vanderhoof (the "Holder").
Under  the  Agreement,  the registrant can borrow up to $500,000.  Money will be
advanced  to  the  registrant  by the Holder against the $500,000 limit upon six
business  days advance written notice by the registrant to the Holder.  Interest
will accrue daily upon any unpaid principal balance at the rate of eight percent
per  annum.  Accrued  interest  is  payable  in  full  monthly.  All outstanding
principal  is due and payable in full on December 10, 2005.  The credit facility
is  secured  by  all  of  the registrant's inventory, accounts, equipment, cash,
deposit  accounts,  securities,  Intellectual  Property,  chattel paper, general
intangibles and instruments, now existing or hereafter arising, and all proceeds
thereof.

The Holder will also receive warrants to purchase shares of common stock of  the
registrant at the exercise price of $3.00 per share.  The  number  of shares the
holder shall be entitle to purchase is  equal to 10 percent of the total  dollar
amount  borrowed under the credit facility.  For example, if the full amount  of
$500,000  is  borrowed,  the  Holder  will  receive warrants for the purchase of
50,000 shares of stock.

The Holder, Mr. Vanderhoof, is a director of the registrant.
