The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements set forth
below for Cooper Tire & Rubber Company give effect to the sale of its automotive

Partners, as if such sale had been completed on January 1, 2001 for income
statement purposes and September 30, 2004 for balance sheet purposes, subject to
the assumptions in the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements.
As of September 30, 2004, the Company had reported the automotive business as a
discontinued operation, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets."

certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable and are described in
the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements. The unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not represent what the
Company's financial position or results of operations would have been had the
sale of the automotive business occurred on such dates or project the Company's
financial position or results of operations at or for any future date or period.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of the Company.

             NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

             (Dollar amounts in thousands except per-share amounts)

Pro forma adjustments to the Company's unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2004 are intended to provide a
view of the order of magnitude of the impact on the Company of the recently
completed sale. The pro forma balance sheet is not intended to represent the
final actual result of the sale but uses a number of estimates and the most
recent quarter end balance sheet to enable timely disclosure. The actual impact
will be determined based on final proceeds and the net assets of the sold
companies as of December 23, 2004. The final impact may differ considerably from
the approximations provided in this filing. Following are comments on the more
significant pro forma September 30, 2004 balance sheet adjustments:

1.   The pro forma adjustment to cash represents the proceeds received at
     closing of approximately $1,172 million. Post closing adjustments for final
     cash, debt and working capital amounts are expected to be resolved in the
     first quarter of 2005 and final payments or refunds are not presently
     estimable.

2.   Pro forma adjustments to accrued liabilities of continuing operations
     reflect preliminary estimates of sale related fees and expenses.

3.   The pro forma adjustment to accrued income taxes is also a preliminary
     estimate based on the methodology described above. Final income taxes
     related to the gain on the sale will be determined by reference to the
     actual tax basis in the respective shares of stock sold as of December 23,
     2004 and the final proceeds allocated to each sold entity.

4.   The pro forma adjustment to retained earnings reflects the gain on the sale
     computed using the estimates described above and the September 30, 2004 net
     assets of the automotive business which was sold. The actual after tax gain
     will be determined based on final proceeds and the actual net assets prior
     to closing on December 23, 2004. Accordingly, it will differ from the
     amount included in this filing.

The Company's Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and twelve months ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 contain pro forma adjustments which represent the
results of operations of the divested automotive business. Those results have
been adjusted for the reallocation to continuing operations of general corporate
overhead previously allocated to the automotive business. The Company has used
the permitted allocation method for interest expense on corporate debt, which is
based on the relation of net assets to be discontinued to the sum of total
assets of the consolidated Company plus corporate debt. This adjustment has been
added to the interest on debt held directly by the automotive business. Actual
interest expense for continuing operations will be the result of Company
decisions during 2005 regarding the repurchase of debt and may differ from the
estimation process used to allocate historical interest expense in the
statements of income.
