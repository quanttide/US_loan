<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2004, Big 5 Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Big 5 Sporting
Goods Corporation (the &#147;Parent&#148;), and Big 5 Services Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (&#147;Big 5 Services&#148; and, together with the Company, the &#147;Borrowers&#148;), entered into, and
consummated the closing of, a Second Amended and Restated Financing Agreement (the &#147;Amended Credit
Facility&#148;) dated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004 with The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (as Agent and as
Lender) and the other Lenders named therein. The Amended Credit Facility increased the aggregate
amount of available loans to the Borrowers from $140&nbsp;million to $160&nbsp;million . The Amended Credit
Facility provides for a new $20&nbsp;million term loan facility (the &#147;Term Loan Facility&#148;) and a $140
million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Revolving Credit Facility&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the closing of the Amended Credit Facility, the Company borrowed $20.0&nbsp;million under the
Term Loan Facility. The Company will use these proceeds, together with drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility, to redeem all of its remaining 10.875% senior notes due 2007 on December
22, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Term Loan Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime
lending rate plus 1.00% when the term loan balance is $10,000,000 or less, and LIBOR plus 3.50% or
the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 1.50% when the term loan balance is greater than
$10,000,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Term Loan Facility is repayable as follows: $6,666,667 in principal amount of the Term
Loan Facility will be due and payable on each of the first and second anniversary dates of the
Amended Credit Facility, and the remaining balance will be due and payable on the third anniversary
date of the Amended Credit Facility. The Borrowers may prepay the Term Loan Facility at any time
without penalty; provided, however, that the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid only in whole or in
$5.0&nbsp;million increments of principal thereof and only so long as the Borrowers have at least $25.0
million in availability under the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to any such
prepayments during the months of February through September of any year or $35.0&nbsp;million after
giving effect to any such prepayments during the months of October through January of any year.
Each prepayment of the Term Loan facility will be applied to the then last maturing installment of
principal under the Term Loan Facility. In addition, the Term Loan Facility will become due and
payable in full upon the termination of the Amended Credit Facility or the Revolving Credit
Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the date of the Amended Credit Facility through June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Revolving Credit
Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate. From
July&nbsp;1, 2005 and thereafter, the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at various rates based on
the Borrowers&#146; performance and the average balance of revolving loans and undrawn letters of
credit, with a floor of LIBOR plus 1.25% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate and a
ceiling of LIBOR plus 2.00% or the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime lending rate plus 0.50%. An annual
fee of 0.325%, payable monthly, is assessed on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Borrowers&#146; maximum eligible borrowing available under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited
to the lesser of 75% of the aggregate value of eligible inventory or 88% of the liquidation value
of such inventory during October through December and the lesser of 70% of the aggregate value of
eligible inventory or 85% of the liquidation value of such inventory during the remaining months of
the year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the ability of the Borrowers to,
among other things: (i)&nbsp;incur liens; (ii)&nbsp;incur additional indebtedness; (iii)&nbsp;transfer or dispose
of assets; (iv)&nbsp;merge, consolidate or alter their line of business; (v)&nbsp;guarantee obligations; (vi)
in the case of the Company, declare or pay dividends in excess of certain permitted amounts or make
other distributions or repurchase its stock; and (vii)&nbsp;make advances, loans or investments.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without
limitation, failure to pay when due amounts in respect of the Term Loan Facility; failure to pay
any other amounts under the Amended Credit Facility for 10&nbsp;days after becoming due; failure to
comply with certain agreements or covenants contained in the Amended Credit Facility for a period
of 15&nbsp;days after Agent&#146;s discovery of such non-compliance; acceleration of more than $3.0&nbsp;million
of certain other indebtedness; and certain bankruptcy events.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a general lien
and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers, including accounts
receivable, documents, equipment, general intangibles and inventory. Any proceeds of the
collateral will be applied first to amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and
then to amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The Parent has guaranteed the obligations of
the Borrowers under the Amended Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended Credit Facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least 90&nbsp;days prior
written notice before any anniversary date, commencing with its anniversary date on March&nbsp;20, 2008.
The Borrowers may terminate the Amended Credit Facility by giving at least 30&nbsp;days prior written
notice, provided that if the Borrowers terminate the Amended Credit Facility prior to March&nbsp;20,
2008, they must pay, depending on the date of such termination, an early termination fee between
0.25% and 0.75% of the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility. Unless it is terminated, the
Amended Credit Facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date
beginning on March&nbsp;21, 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the Amended Credit Facility were established in an arms-length negotiation in
which The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. acted as agent for the various lenders. There are no
material relationships between the Agent and the other lenders under the Amended Credit Facility
and the Parent or the Borrowers, other than that the Agent served as agent and as a lender, and the
lenders under the Amended Credit Facility were lenders, under the Borrowers&#146; prior credit facility.
The Agent will receive customary fees in connection with its services as agent under the Amended
Credit Facility. The outstanding amount of indebtedness under the Borrowers&#146; prior revolving
credit facility, which was approximately $100.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;15, 2004, was unchanged as a
result of the Borrowers&#146; entering into the Amended Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above description of the Amended Credit Facility does not purport to be a complete
statement of the parties&#146; rights and obligations under the Amended Credit Facility and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the Amended Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached to this
Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Any
information disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K or the exhibits hereto shall not be
