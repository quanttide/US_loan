<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2004, Monarch Community Bancorp entered into management
continuity agreements with two of its executive officers &#150; William C. Kurtz,
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Andrew J. Van Doren, Vice
President and General Counsel. In the case of Mr. Kurtz, the
management continuity agreement replaces an agreement entered into
previously between Mr. Kurtz and Monarch Community Bank, the
Company&#146;s principal subsidiary. The material terms of the management continuity
agreements are set forth below. The form of management continuity agreement is
attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1. Definition of Change in Control; Change in Control Period</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.1 Change in Control. </B>For purpose of this Agreement, a &#147;Change in
Control&#148; of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred upon:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) any third person, including a &#147;group&#148; as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, shall become the
beneficial owner of shares of the Company with respect to which 25% or
more of the total number of votes for the election of the Board maybe
cast;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) there occurs a change in control of the Bank within the meaning
of the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933 or 12 C.F.R. Part&nbsp;574;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) as a result of, or in connection with, any merger or other
business combination, sale of assets or contested election, wherein the
persons who were directors of the Company before such transaction or
event cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Company or any successor to the Company; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) the Company transfers substantially all of its assets to another
corporation or entity which is not an affiliate of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control will not be deemed to
have occurred:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) solely because more than 25% of the combined voting power of the
then outstanding voting securities of the Company are acquired by (1)&nbsp;a
trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under one or more employee
benefit plans maintained for employees of the Bank or the Company, or (2)
in the event of a merger or similar transaction involving the Company or
the Bank occurs and immediately following such transaction, persons who
were shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction
remain shareholders of the Company or other party to the transaction in
the same proportion as their previous ownership of stock; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if Executive agrees in writing that the transaction or event in
question does not constitute a Change of Control for the purposes of this
Agreement.

Executive terminates (his/her) employment for Good Reason (as hereinafter

following the date of termination in an amount not less than (his/her)
base salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control; plus



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Executive and Executive&#146;s family shall continue to be provided,
at the expense of the Company, continuing health care coverage under
health care programs in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control
(or health care programs substantially similar thereto) for a period of
twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the date of termination, provided that, to the

employed, Executive shall continue to pay such portion during the period
of continuation hereunder and provided further, that if such benefit is
subject to the health care continuation rules of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (&#147;COBRA&#148;) then any period of
continuation hereunder shall be credited against the continuation rights
under COBRA and Executive will be required to complete all COBRA election
and other forms.

obligation to pay to Executive (his/her) annual base salary through the date of
termination and to provide Executive any other benefits which have accrued
prior to the date of termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.3 Cause</B>. If Executive&#146;s employment shall be terminated for Cause during

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.1 Cause</B>. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean termination
due to Executive&#146;s personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct,
breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to
perform stated duties or to follow one or more specific written directives of
the Board, reasonable in nature and scope, willful violation of any law, rule
or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final
cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any provision of this Agreement
(which is not cured within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after its occurrence and notice to
Executive). Any determination of &#147;Cause&#148; as defined by this Section&nbsp;4.1 shall
be determined by a majority vote of the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.2 Disability. </B>&#147;Disability&#148; shall have the meaning as such term has
under the Company&#146;s Long-Term Disability Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.3. Good Reason. </B>For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Good Reason&#148; shall
mean the occurrence of any of the following events which have not been
consented to in advance by Executive in writing:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) if Executive would be required to move (his/her) personal
residence or perform (his/her) principal executive functions more than
twenty-five (25)&nbsp;miles from Executive&#146;s primary office as of the date
immediately prior to the Change of Control;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if the Company should fail to maintain Executive&#146;s base salary
or fail to maintain employee benefit plans or arrangements generally
comparable to those in place as of the date immediately prior to the
Change in Control, except to the extent that such reduction in employee
benefit plans is part of an overall adjustment in benefits for all
employees of the Company or the Bank; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) if Executive would be assigned substantial duties and
responsibilities other than those normally associated with the position
referenced in the preambles to this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The preceding events shall only provide the basis for &#147;Good Reason&#148; if
Executive provides notice of such events within one hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;days
of their occurrence in the manner required by Section&nbsp;5.1 of this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.4 Retirement. </B>For purpose of this Agreement, termination of Executive&#146;s
employment based on &#147;Retirement&#148; shall mean voluntary termination in accordance

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.1 Reduction in Excess Parachute Payments Tax Ramifications. </B>In the
event it shall be determined that any payment made hereunder or pursuant to any
other plan following a Change in Control (whether paid or payable pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement) would be subject to the excise tax imposed in
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#147;Code&#148;), then payments
pursuant to this Agreement or payments under any other agreement or plan that
are treated as being contingent upon a change in control under Section&nbsp;280G of
the Code shall be reduced to the maximum amount that may be paid to Executive
or for (his/her) benefit without any such payment constituting an &#147;parachute
payment,&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. The determination of the
maximum amount payable to Executive or for (his/her) benefit shall be made by
an accounting firm mutually acceptable to Executive and the Company, and unless
Executive directs otherwise, payments that are considered to be partially
contingent upon a change in control shall be the last payments to be reduced.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.2 Section&nbsp;162(m)</B>. Should payments be precluded from deduction by the
Company under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company may defer until the first

payments will be non-deductible under 162(m) (the &#147;Determination Year&#148;) only
those amounts necessary to maintain the tax deductibility of compensation paid

Executive&#146;s employment under the provision indicated and the date of
termination.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by the Executive for
Good Reason, the date of the receipt of the notice contemplated by
Section&nbsp;5.1 hereof;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by the Company or the
Bank other than for Death, Disability or Retirement, the date of
termination shall be the date on which the Company or the Bank notifies
Executive of the termination; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by reason of Death,
Disability or Retirement, the date of termination shall be the date of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Management Continuity Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is entered into this
16th day of December, 2004 between Monarch Community Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&#147;Executive&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WITNESSETH:</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Executive is currently employed by the Company&#146;s affiliate,
Monarch Community Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;), as its &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Company desires to provide certain security to Executive in
connection with a change in control of the Company or the Bank;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;1. Definition of Change in Control; Change in Control Period</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.1 Change in Control. </B>For purpose of this Agreement, a &#147;Change in
Control&#148; of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred upon:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) any third person, including a &#147;group&#148; as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, shall become the
beneficial owner of shares of the Company with respect to which 25% or
more of the total number of votes for the election of the Board maybe
cast;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) there occurs a change in control of the Bank within the meaning
of the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933 or 12 C.F.R. Part&nbsp;574;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) as a result of, or in connection with, any merger or other
business combination, sale of assets or contested election, wherein the
persons who were directors of the Company before such transaction or
event cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Company or any successor to the Company; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) the Company transfers substantially all of its assets to another
corporation or entity which is not an affiliate of the Company.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control will not be deemed to
have occurred:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) solely because more than 25% of the combined voting power of the
then outstanding voting securities of the Company are acquired by (1)&nbsp;a
trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under one or more employee
benefit plans maintained for employees of the Bank or the Company, or (2)
in the event of a merger or similar transaction involving

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">the Company or the Bank occurs and immediately following such
transaction, persons who were shareholders of the Company immediately
prior to such transaction remain shareholders of the Company or other
party to the transaction in the same proportion as their previous
ownership of stock; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if Executive agrees in writing that the transaction or event in
question does not constitute a Change of Control for the purposes of this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.2 Change in Control Period. </B>The Change-in-Control Period shall mean the
period commencing on the date of a Change in Control and ending on the twelve
(12)&nbsp;month anniversary of the date thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;2. Obligations of the Company upon Termination.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.1 Other than for Cause, Death, Disability or Retirement. </B>If, during the
Change-in-Control Period, Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by the Company

(as hereinafter defined), or Retirement (as hereinafter defined) or if
Executive terminates (his/her) employment for Good Reason (as hereinafter
defined), Executive shall receive:

base salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control; plus



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Executive and Executive&#146;s family shall continue to be provided,
at the expense of the Company, continuing health care coverage under
health care programs in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control
(or health care programs substantially similar thereto) for a period of
twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the date of termination, provided that, to the
extent Executive paid a portion of the premium for such benefit while
employed, Executive shall continue to pay such portion during the period
of continuation hereunder and provided further, that if such benefit is
subject to the health care continuation rules of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (&#147;COBRA&#148;) then any period of
continuation hereunder shall be credited against the continuation rights
under COBRA and Executive will be required to complete all COBRA election
and other forms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.2 Cause; Death; Disability; Retirement</B>. If Executive&#146;s employment is
terminated by reason of Death, Disability or Retirement during the
Change-in-Control Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further
obligation to Executive or (his/her) legal representatives other than the
obligation to pay to Executive (his/her) annual base salary through the date of
termination and to provide Executive any other benefits which have accrued
prior to the date of termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.3 Cause</B>. If Executive&#146;s employment shall be terminated for Cause during
the Change-in-Control Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.1 Cause</B>. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean termination
due to Executive&#146;s personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct,
breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to
perform stated duties or to follow one or more specific written directives of
the Board, reasonable in nature and scope, willful violation of any law, rule
or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final
cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any provision of this Agreement
(which is not cured within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after its occurrence and notice to
Executive). Any determination of &#147;Cause&#148; as defined by this Section&nbsp;4.1 shall
be determined by a majority vote of the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.2 Disability. </B>&#147;Disability&#148; shall have the meaning as such term has
under the Company&#146;s Long-Term Disability Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.3. Good Reason. </B>For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Good Reason&#148; shall
mean the occurrence of any of the following events which have not been
consented to in advance by Executive in writing:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) if Executive would be required to move (his/her) personal
residence or perform (his/her) principal executive functions more than
twenty-five (25)&nbsp;miles from Executive&#146;s primary office as of the date
immediately prior to the Change of Control;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if the Company should fail to maintain Executive&#146;s base salary
or fail to maintain employee benefit plans or arrangements generally
comparable to those in place as of the date immediately prior to the
Change in Control, except to the extent that such reduction in employee
benefit plans is part of an overall adjustment in benefits for all
employees of the Company or the Bank; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) if Executive would be assigned substantial duties and
responsibilities other than those normally associated with the position
referenced in the preambles to this Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The preceding events shall only provide the basis for &#147;Good Reason&#148; if
Executive provides notice of such events within one hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;days
of their occurrence in the manner required by Section&nbsp;5.1 of this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.4 Retirement. </B>For purpose of this Agreement, termination of Executive&#146;s

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.1 Reduction in Excess Parachute Payments Tax Ramifications. </B>In the
event it shall be determined that any payment made hereunder or pursuant to any
other plan following a Change in Control (whether paid or payable pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement) would be subject to the excise tax imposed in
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#147;Code&#148;), then payments
pursuant to this Agreement or payments under any other agreement or plan that
are treated as being contingent upon a change in control under Section&nbsp;280G of
the Code shall be reduced to the maximum amount that may be paid to Executive
or for (his/her) benefit without any such payment constituting an &#147;parachute
payment,&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. The determination of the
maximum amount payable to Executive or for (his/her) benefit shall be made by
an accounting firm mutually acceptable to Executive and the Company, and unless
Executive directs otherwise, payments that are considered to be partially
contingent upon a change in control shall be the last payments to be reduced.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.2 Section&nbsp;162(m)</B>. Should payments be precluded from deduction by the
Company under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company may defer until the first
day of the tax year following the year in which determination is made that
payments will be non-deductible under 162(m) (the &#147;Determination Year&#148;) only
those amounts necessary to maintain the tax deductibility of compensation paid
to Executive in the Determination Year.

Executive&#146;s employment under the provision indicated and the date of
termination.

Good Reason, the date of the receipt of the notice contemplated by
Section&nbsp;5.1 hereof;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by the Company or the
Bank other than for Death, Disability or Retirement, the date of
termination shall be the date on which the Company or the Bank notifies
Executive of the termination; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by reason of Death,

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) In the event of dispute under this Agreement, the parties agree
pursuant to MCLA 600.5001; MSA 27A.5001, et seq., to binding arbitration
in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association
(&#147;AAA&#148;) in effect at the time a demand for arbitration of the dispute is
made, with the place of arbitration being Coldwater, Michigan. The
prevailing party in any such arbitration shall be entitled to recover
from the other party all expenses for attorneys, fees and costs incurred
by the prevailing party in conjunction with the arbitration proceedings.
The decision and award of the arbitrator made under the AAA rules shall
be exclusive, final and binding on all parties, their heirs,
representatives, affiliates, successors and assigns. It is further
agreed that any arbitration award may be certified to the Branch County
Circuit Court which shall render a judgment upon the award made pursuant
to said arbitration;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Limited civil discovery shall be permitted for the production of
documents and the taking of depositions, provided, however, that no party
is permitted to take the deposition of more than three witnesses except
by agreement of the other party or upon order of the arbitrator pursuant
to the motion of a party. Subject to the foregoing limitations,
discovery shall be conducted in accordance with the Michigan Court Rules
with any enforcement issues resolved by the arbitrator;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The arbitration and all proceedings, discovery and any award of
the arbitrator, are confidential. Neither the parties nor the arbitrator
shall disclose any information gained during the course of the
arbitration or any person or entity who is not a party to the arbitration
unless permitted by law. Attendance at the arbitration shall be limited
to the parties, counsel and those called as witnesses; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Executive and the Company acknowledge that each has had the
opportunity to consult with counsel of choice before signing this
agreement, and Executive and the Company each hereby knowingly and
voluntarily, without coercion, WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY or all
disputes between them and instead agrees to binding arbitration.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;7. Successors and Assigns</B>. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon any corporate or other successor of the Company which
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, purchase or
otherwise, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. Since the
Executive&#146;s services are the unique and personal skills of Executive, Executive
shall be precluded from assigning or delegating his rights or duties hereunder
without first obtaining the written consent of the Company.
