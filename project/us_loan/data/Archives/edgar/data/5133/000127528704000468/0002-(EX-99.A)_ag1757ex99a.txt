                  AMERICAN GREETINGS ANNOUNCES IMPROVED RESULTS

    -   Company reports third quarter EPS of 78 cents versus 60 cents in prior
        year period

    -   Continuing Operations exceeds Company's estimate

    -   Announces sale of Magnivision for $77 million. Substantial gain boosts
        quarterly Net Income and EPS

    -   Company declares quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share

    CLEVELAND, Dec. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation
(NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for the third fiscal quarter
ended November 30, 2004. The Corporation exceeded its prior year earnings per
share results due primarily to a substantial gain on the sale of its Magnivision
subsidiary. The Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per
share.

    Third Quarter
    As a result of the announced sale of the Magnivision subsidiary, that
business unit has been classified as a discontinued operation. The Corporation
has presented financial results on continuing operations as well as net results
of discontinued operations. For the fiscal 2005 third quarter ended November 30,
2004, the Corporation reported net income from continuing operations of $40.3
million or 51 cents per share compared to $45.1 million or 58 cents per share
for continuing operations in the prior year (all per-share amounts assume
dilution). Discontinued operations contributed $22.4 million of net income or 27
cents per share to the third quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to the gain on
the sale of Magnivision. In the prior year's third quarter, discontinued
operations contributed $1.3 million of net income or 2 cents per share.

    Within this year's third quarter, the Company realized a $35.5 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of Magnivision. This gain was reflected in discontinued
operations. The Company also recorded $16.6 million of expense associated with a
300 person overhead reduction program, $13.0 million of expense to reflect a
change in timing for greeting card returns associated with a revised
merchandising strategy and $8.2 million of expense associated with a plant
closure. These expenses were all reflected in continuing operations for the
third quarter.

    On a consolidated basis, for the third quarter of fiscal 2005, American
Greetings reported net income of $62.8 million or 78 cents per share, on net
sales of $586 million. In the third fiscal quarter of 2004, the Company reported
net income of $46.4 million or 60 cents per share on net sales of $604 million.
In the prior year's third fiscal quarter, the Company incurred $13.8 million of
pre-tax costs associated with a repurchase of the Company's bonds and these
costs were included in continuing operations.

    Net sales were down versus the prior period's third quarter as lower
revenues in both the retail segment and seasonal gift wrap business were
combined with the $13.0 million non-cash accrual to reflect an adjusted

merchandising strategy for seasonal product. These reductions to sales were
partially offset by incremental revenue from acquisitions in the AG Interactive
segment and favorable foreign exchange movements.

    Year-to-Date Results
    The Corporation reported net income of $73.9 million or 97 cents per share,
on net sales of $1.41 billion, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005.
Included in the year-to-date results are $39 million of pre-tax costs incurred
(during the first quarter) for debt repurchases. In fiscal 2004, the Corporation
reported net income of $56.4 million or 78 cents per share, on net sales of
$1.44 billion. The prior year's results include $18.4 million of pre- tax costs
incurred for debt repurchases (in both the first and third quarters).

    Management Comments and Outlook
    Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer said, "In the third quarter, we continued
to focus on reducing our costs in both our supply chain and in our overhead
structure. While never a pleasant task, we recognize the necessity of taking
these actions due to the continuing changes in our business. The savings
resulting from these actions will be reinvested into our business in fiscal
2006. Without these costs, we surpassed our estimate for the quarter." Weiss
added, "Within the quarter, we closed on the Magnivision sale. We felt that our
Magnivision subsidiary would be a better fit under an owner with a strategic
focus on glasses. Given the sale price, we are pleased with the value provided
to our shareholders."

    Weiss continued, "After quarter end, we entered into an agreement with The
Hatchery, a family entertainment and property-development firm. Through
continued investment, we are committed to enhancing the licensing business model
that we have grown over the last few years."

    "For the full year, we are projecting our earnings per share from continuing
operations to be between $1.02 and $1.07. This estimate is in line with previous
guidance of $1.46 to $1.51 per share when adjusted for the full year impact of
the three programs described above," Weiss said.

    Dividend Declaration
    The Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the declaration of a
quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share for shareholders of record at the
close of business on January 12, 2005, payable to those shareholders on January
24, 2005.
