                          SECOND FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT
                          ----------------------------

     THIS SECOND FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") is made as of December 21,
2004, by and among PLANGRAPHICS, INC., a Maryland corporation ("BORROWER"), JOHN
C. ANTENUCCI and ROBIN L. ANTENUCCI (collectively, the "INDIVIDUAL GUARANTORS"),
and PLANGRAPHICS, INC., a Colorado corporation ("CORPORATE GUARANTOR"), and
BRANCH BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY, a North Carolina banking corporation ("BANK").
The BORROWER, the INDIVIDUAL GUARANTORS and the CORPORATE GUARANTOR are
hereafter collectively referred to as the "OBLIGORS."

                                R E C I T A L S:
                                ----------------

     R1. The BORROWER is currently indebted to the BANK under and in connection
with a $750,000.00 revolving line of credit loan ("LINE OF CREDIT") which the
BANK previously provided to the BORROWER.

     R2. The LINE OF CREDIT is evidenced by, among other things: (i) a BB&T Loan
Agreement, dated February 15, 2002, as amended and modified by a Schedule "DD"
to BB&T Loan Agreement, dated February 15, 2002, and an Amendment to the BB&T
Loan Agreement, dated July 1, 2004, by and between the BANK and the BORROWER
(collectively, the "LOAN AGREEMENT"); and (ii) a Promissory Note, dated February
15, 2002, executed and delivered by the BORROWER to the order of the BANK in the
maximum stated principal amount of $750,000.00, as modified by various Note
Modification Agreements of various dates executed by the BORROWER (collectively,
the "NOTE").

     R3. The INDIVIDUAL GUARANTORS, jointly and severally, unconditionally
guaranteed the payment and performance of all amounts that are owed by the
BORROWER to the BANK under and in connection with the NOTE and the LINE OF
CREDIT, pursuant to various Guaranty Agreements dated February 15, 2002 and July
1, 2004 which were executed by the INDIVIDUAL GUARANTORS in favor of the BANK
(collectively, the "INDIVIDUAL GUARANTIES").

     R4. The CORPORATE GUARANTOR also unconditionally guaranteed the payment and
performance of all amounts that are owed by the BORROWER to the BANK under and
in connection with the NOTE and the LINE OF CREDIT, pursuant to a Guaranty
Agreement dated October 22, 2004 which was executed by the CORPORATE GUARANTOR
in favor of the BANK ("CORPORATE GUARANTY").

     R5. The indebtedness that is owed to the BANK under the LINE OF CREDIT and
the loan documents relating thereto is secured by first priority duly perfected
security interests and liens in, to and against various tangible and intangible
assets of the BORROWER, including, without limitation, all of the BORROWER'S
accounts, accounts receivable, contract rights, equipment, general intangibles,
and all products and proceeds thereof, pursuant to a BB&T Security Agreement
dated February 15, 2002 and a BB&T Security Agreement dated September 12, 2002
executed by the BORROWER in favor of the BANK (collectively, the "SECURITY
AGREEMENTS") and various financing statements relating to the BORROWER in favor
of the BANK and recorded among the financing statement records of the Maryland
State Department of Assessments and Taxation (collectively, the "FINANCING
STATEMENTS").

<PAGE>

     R6. The LOAN AGREEMENT, the NOTE, the INDIVIDUAL GUARANTIES, the CORPORATE
GUARANTY, the SECURITY AGREEMENTS, the FINANCING STATEMENTS, the FIRST
FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT (as defined below) and all other documents executed in
connection with or relating to the LINE OF CREDIT are hereafter referred to
collectively as the "ORIGINAL LOAN DOCUMENTS." The ORIGINAL LOAN DOCUMENTS and
this AGREEMENT are hereafter referred to collectively as the "LOAN DOCUMENTS."

     R7. All assets of the BORROWER which now or hereafter serve as security for
the indebtedness that is owed to the BANK under the LINE OF CREDIT and the LOAN
DOCUMENTS are referred to herein collectively as the "COLLATERAL."

     R8. As a result of various defaults under the LINE OF CREDIT, the BANK and
the OBLIGORS previously entered into a Forbearance Agreement dated October 22,
2004 ("FIRST FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT"). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the FIRST FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT, the forbearance period stated therein expired
on December 3, 2004, at which time all indebtedness owed under the LINE OF
CREDIT and the ORIGINAL LOAN DOCUMENTS became immediately due and payable from
the OBLIGORS to the BANK.

     R9. The OBLIGORS have not paid the BANK all indebtedness that is owed under
the LINE OF CREDIT as required by the FIRST FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT. Consequently,
the OBLIGORS are presently in default under the ORIGINAL LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     R10. The OBLIGORS have asked the BANK to: (a) forbear against the OBLIGORS
and the COLLATERAL as set forth herein; (b) accept payment of the indebtedness
that is owed to the BANK under the LINE OF CREDIT pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth below; (c) make certain limited advances to the BORROWER
under the LINE OF CREDIT as set forth herein; and (d) agree to the other terms
and conditions set forth herein. The BANK has now had an opportunity to review
the OBLIGORS' requests, and in connection therewith, is willing to agree as set
forth below.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              --------------------

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

     1. Recitals. The recitals set forth above are true and accurate in every
respect and are hereby incorporated into this AGREEMENT by reference.

     2. Forbearance Period. The BANK hereby agrees, subject to the terms and

the OBLIGORS and the COLLATERAL until the earlier of an EVENT OF DEFAULT (as
defined below) hereunder or 3:00 p.m. on January 10, 2005 (the "FORBEARANCE
PERIOD"). Upon the expiration of the FORBEARANCE PERIOD or upon the occurrence
of an EVENT OF DEFAULT (as defined below), all indebtedness that is owed under
the LOAN DOCUMENTS at that time, including, without limitation, all principal,
accrued and unpaid interest, late charges, audit and field examination fees,

$362,140.86, consisting of an outstanding principal balance of $359,028.80 and

     5. Attorneys' Fees and Expenses. In addition to the above referenced

the defaults existing under the ORIGINAL LOAN DOCUMENTS, including, but not
limited to, all costs, expenses and attorneys' fees which the BANK has incurred

attorneys' fees and expenses, recording fees, audit and field examination fees,
due diligence expenses, record search charges and appraisal fees, shall be the

this AGREEMENT and the other LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     6. Forbearance Fee. In consideration for the various agreements of the BANK
as set forth herein, the OBLIGORS shall pay the BANK a forbearance fee in the
amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) ("FORBEARANCE FEE"). The FORBEARANCE

by the BANK to reduce any of the outstanding indebtedness that is owed by the
OBLIGORS under the LOAN DOCUMENTS. The FORBEARANCE FEE shall be paid by the
OBLIGORS to the BANK simultaneously with the execution of this AGREEMENT. The
BORROWER hereby authorizes the BANK to debit its OPERATING ACCOUNT (as defined
below) for the FORBEARANCE FEE.

     7. Interest Rate; Default Interest Rate. Until all indebtedness that is
owed under the LINE OF CREDIT has been paid in full, interest shall continue to
accrue on the outstanding principal balance that is owed to the BANK under the
LINE OF CREDIT at an interest rate equal to the BANK'S "Prime Rate" as defined
in the NOTE plus six percent (6%) per annum to be adjusted daily. Upon an EVENT
OF DEFAULT, the BANK may assess and charge any default rate of interest called
for in the LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     8. Confirmation Of Obligations. The OBLIGORS acknowledge, ratify and
confirm their respective obligations to the BANK under the ORIGINAL LOAN
DOCUMENTS and further acknowledge, ratify and confirm that they are and shall
remain, jointly and severally, absolutely and unconditionally obligated to pay
the BANK all present and future indebtedness that is owed under the LOAN
DOCUMENTS.

<PAGE>

     9. Representations Regarding Collateral; Termination of National City
Financing Statement. The OBLIGORS hereby acknowledge, ratify and confirm that
all present and future indebtedness that is owed to the BANK under the LOAN
DOCUMENTS is and shall hereafter continue to be secured by duly perfected
security interests and liens in, to and against the COLLATERAL. The OBLIGORS
further acknowledge and agree that the BANK shall not be obligated to release
any of the liens which it holds against any of the COLLATERAL unless and until
the BANK is paid all amounts that are owed under the LINE OF CREDIT and the LOAN
DOCUMENTS. The OBLIGORS hereby represent and warrant to the BANK that no
creditor, other than the BANK, holds a lien or security interest against any of
the COLLATERAL. The OBLIGORS further represent and warrant to the BANK that the
BORROWER is not indebted to National City Bank of Kentucky for any amount of
money and that the financing statement previously recorded against the BORROWER
by National City Bank of Kentucky on or about June 26, 2000 (Original Lien
Number 181050723) (the "NATIONAL CITY FINANCING STATEMENT") among the financing
statement records of the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation
should have been terminated. Within five (5) business days after the execution
of this AGREEMENT, the BORROWER shall cause a termination statement to be filed
by National City Bank of Kentucky in the Maryland State Department of
Assessments and Taxation in order to terminate the NATIONAL CITY FINANCING
STATEMENT and shall provide a date-stamped copy of such recorded termination
statement to the BANK.

     10. Representations Regarding Accounts Receivable. The OBLIGORS hereby
acknowledge that the BORROWER has provided the BANK with a "Loan Base Report"
dated December 20, 2004 representing to the BANK that the BORROWER has valid
outstanding accounts receivable in the amount of $2,102,142.81 as of December
17, 2004 ("AGING STATEMENT"). The OBLIGORS hereby represent and warrant to the
BANK that the BORROWER owns all of the accounts receivable listed in the AGING
STATEMENT and that the AGING STATEMENT is true, accurate and complete in all
respects.

     11. Payments. The indebtedness that is owed to the BANK under the LINE OF
CREDIT and the LOAN DOCUMENTS relating thereto shall be paid by the OBLIGORS to
the BANK in the following manner:

          (a) Simultaneously with the execution of this AGREEMENT, the OBLIGORS
shall deliver a payment to the BANK in an amount equal to the CURRENT FEES and a
payment in an amount equal to the FORBEARANCE FEE;

          (b) On January 1, 2005, the OBLIGORS shall deliver to the BANK, in
immediately available funds, a payment equal to the accrued and unpaid interest
that is owed under the LINE OF CREDIT and the LOAN DOCUMENTS; and

attorneys' fees owed thereunder.

<PAGE>

          (d) The BORROWER hereby authorizes the BANK to debit its OPERATING
ACCOUNT (as defined below) for all of the payments called for in this AGREEMENT,
including, without limitation, all payments called for in this Section.

     12. Obligation To Seek Refinancing. During the FORBEARANCE PERIOD, the
OBLIGORS shall use their best efforts to obtain a loan from a lender other than
the BANK in order to refinance the LINE OF CREDIT and pay the BANK all amounts
that are owed thereunder prior to January 10, 2005. The OBLIGORS shall provide
the BANK with copies of any applications which they submit to apply for such
refinancing and copies of all letters of intent, commitment letters and
settlement statements which are submitted, prepared and/or executed in
connection with the OBLIGORS' efforts at obtaining a refinancing loan. The
OBLIGORS acknowledge that their respective obligations under the LOAN DOCUMENTS,
including the OBLIGORS' obligation to make the payments called for under this
AGREEMENT, shall not be contingent upon the OBLIGORS' ability to obtain a
refinancing loan from another lender.

     13. Borrowing Base; Maximum Line Amount. The parties hereto agree that: (i)
during the FORBEARANCE PERIOD the "Borrowing Base" under the LINE OF CREDIT (the
"BORROWING BASE") shall be equal to seventy percent (70%) of the BORROWER'S
"Eligible Accounts" as defined in the LOAN DOCUMENTS that are less than sixty
days (60) from the original date of invoicing, with the exception of any
accounts receivable that are due from New York which such accounts shall be
"Eligible Accounts" provided that they are less than ninety (90) days from the
original date of invoicing; and (ii) the maximum principal amount outstanding
under the LINE OF CREDIT any given time shall not exceed the lesser of: (a)
$750,000.00; or (b) the BORROWING BASE (the "MAXIMUM LINE AMOUNT").

     14. Weekly Loan Base Reports. On each Monday during the FORBEARANCE PERIOD,
the BORROWER shall provide the BANK with a fully and properly prepared "Loan
Base Report" ("LOAN BASE REPORT"), as that term is defined in the LOAN
DOCUMENTS, in a form and substance that is acceptable to the BANK in all
respects, together with all schedules, agings, certificates, lists, records,
reports and other documents as the BANK may require in its sole and absolute
discretion.

     15. Limited Advances Under the Line of Credit. During the FORBEARANCE
PERIOD, the BANK may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make certain limited
advances to the BORROWER under the LINE OF CREDIT and the LOAN DOCUMENTS
evidencing the same, subject to the following terms, covenants and limitations:

          (a) as a condition precedent to the BORROWER'S right to receive any
further advances from the BANK under the LINE OF CREDIT, no EVENT OF DEFAULT
shall have occurred under this AGREEMENT or any of the other LOAN DOCUMENTS;

          (b) any further advances from the BANK to the BORROWER under the LINE
OF CREDIT shall not cause the total principal indebtedness that is outstanding
under the LINE OF CREDIT and the LOAN DOCUMENTS to exceed the MAXIMUM LINE
AMOUNT;

          (c) the BORROWER shall have provided the BANK with a fully and
properly prepared LOAN BASE REPORT, in a form and substance that is acceptable
to the BANK in all respects, so that the BANK may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, determine the BORROWING BASE for the LINE OF CREDIT;

<PAGE>

          (d) all other terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the LOAN
DOCUMENTS that are applicable to any request for an advance under the LINE OF
CREDIT, to the extent not modified herein, shall also be applicable to any
advance hereafter requested by the BORROWER under the LINE OF CREDIT and must be
complied with by the BORROWER as a condition precedent to the BORROWER's right
to receive any further advances from the BANK under the LINE OF CREDIT; and

          (e) each advance requested by the BORROWER under the LINE OF CREDIT
must be acceptable to the BANK in all respects in the BANK's sole and absolute
discretion.

The parties hereto agree that all advances hereafter made by the BANK to the
BORROWER under the LINE OF CREDIT shall constitute additional indebtedness that
is due and owing from the OBLIGORS to the BANK under the NOTE and the other LOAN
DOCUMENTS, shall be secured by first priority duly perfected security interests
and liens in, to and against the COLLATERAL, and shall be due and payable from
the OBLIGORS to the BANK as provided for herein. Moreover, the OBLIGORS hereby
acknowledge and agree that in the event that any advances made by the BANK to
the BORROWER under the LINE OF CREDIT exceed the MAXIMUM LINE AMOUNT, the
OBLIGORS shall be unconditionally liable to the BANK for all such amounts
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     16. Termination of Line of Credit. The OBLIGORS hereby acknowledge and
agree that upon the earlier of the occurrence of an EVENT OF DEFAULT (as
hereafter defined) hereunder or the expiration of the FORBEARANCE PERIOD, the
revolving nature of the LINE OF CREDIT shall automatically terminate without
notice and the BANK, thereafter, shall not be obligated or required to make any
further advances to the BORROWER or to any other person or entity under the LINE
OF CREDIT or under any of the LOAN DOCUMENTS evidencing the same. The OBLIGORS
also acknowledge and agree that the above-described termination of the revolving
nature of the LINE OF CREDIT shall be valid, proper and binding and shall not
create any defense, offset, or counterclaim in favor of any of the OBLIGORS with
respect to their respective obligations to the BANK under the LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     17. Lock Box; Collateral Reserve Account; Receivables Collections. All of
the BORROWER'S present and future account receivable collections to be sent
directly to the lock box at the BANK which was previously established in
connection with the LINE OF CREDIT ("LOCK BOX"). All account receivable
collections that are received by the BANK in the LOCK BOX will be deposited by
the BANK into the Collateral Reserve Account, account number 5152855771
("COLLATERAL RESERVE ACCOUNT"), at the BANK which was previously established in
connection with the LINE OF CREDIT. In the event that the BORROWER receives any
account receivable collections, cash, checks or other proceeds of the BANK'S
COLLATERAL, the BORROWER shall hold such funds in trust for the BANK and shall
immediately deposit all such funds into the COLLATERAL RESERVE ACCOUNT at the
BANK. Until such time as all indebtedness that is owed to the BANK under the

BANK shall not be obligated for any reason to honor any checks, ACH (Automated

The OBLIGORS further acknowledge and agree that in the event that any check, ACH
debit or other item is presented for payment against any BANK ACCOUNT at such
time when there are insufficient collected and immediately available funds in
the BANK ACCOUNT to cover said check, ACH debit or item, the BANK shall be
entitled, in its sole and absolute discretion, to return some or all of such
check(s), ACH debit(s) or item(s) unpaid. In the event that any overdraft is
