Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

     As described  in more detail in Item 4.02 of this  report,  the officers of
MERIT  Securities  Corporation (the "Company") have identified a potential issue
with respect to the accounting for impairments on debt securities and provisions
for  losses  on  loans  pledged  as  collateral  for the  repayment  of  certain
non-recourse securitization financing bonds issued by the Company.  Accordingly,
the  Company  discloses  in this  report that its  previously  issued  financial
statements  contained  in its  Annual  Report  on Form  10-K for the year  ended
December 31, 2003 and its  Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended
March 30,  2004 and June 30,  2004  should  not be relied  upon  because  of the
possibility of an error in those  financial  statements  that may arise from the
issue that the officers  have  identified.  The Company  will also  complete its
financial  statements  for the  period  ended  September  30,  2004 and file its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for that period as soon as practicable.


Item 4.02  Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related
           Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.

     As described below, the officers of the Company have identified a potential
issue with respect to the  accounting  for  impairments  on debt  securities and
provisions  for  losses on loans  pledged as  collateral  for the  repayment  of
certain  non-recourse  securitization  financing  bonds  issued by the  Company.
Accordingly,  on December 23, 2004,  the officers of the Company  concluded that
the previously  issued  financial  statements  contained in the Company's Annual
Report on Form  10-K for the year  ended  December  31,  2003 and its  Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the  periods  ended  March 30,  2004 and June 30,  2004
should  not be  relied  upon  because  of the  possibility  of an error in those
financial  statements  that may arise  from the  issue  that the  officers  have
identified.

     Historically,  the Company ceased recording  impairments on debt securities
and provisions  for losses on loans where,  as part of the  securitization,  the
Company has  transferred  the risk of principal  losses  beyond a  predetermined
amount to third  parties.  This  transfer of risk takes place at the time of the
securitization transaction,  through the issuance of non-recourse securitization
financing bonds.  Once the level of actual and estimated  principal losses reach
the maximum  amount that could be borne by the Company  pursuant to the terms of
the  securitization  transaction,  the  Company  does not  recognize  impairment
charges or provisions for loan losses for any additional  losses. At this point,
the risk of loss  transfers  to the holders of the  non-recourse  securitization
financing  bonds,  and such additional  losses are borne and recognized by these
holders through the extinguishment of the associated bonds.

     The Company has determined that generally  accepted  accounting  principles
may require the Company to continue to record impairment  charges and provisions
for loan  losses even if it  ultimately  no longer  bears the risk of loss.  The
Company  would  then  record a gain on the  extinguishment  of the bonds for the
losses  incurred  by the  holders of such  bonds,  at the time such  losses were
incurred.  Previously  in its  financial  statements,  as described  above,  the
Company had ceased  recording  impairment  charges or provisions for loan losses
when the  predetermined  loss threshold had been met. The Company has no further
obligations with respect to repayment of the securitization financing bonds.

     The officers of the Company have preliminarily determined, after discussion
with its independent  registered public accounting firm,  Deloitte & Touche LLP,
that additional  impairment  charges on debt securities or provisions for losses
on loans  due to actual  and  projected  principal  losses  above the  specified
maximum to be borne and recognized by the Company may need to be recorded in the
Company's financial statements,  even if the ultimate risk of that loss has been
transferred and is then held by the holders of the  non-recourse  securitization
financing bonds. The Company is currently  evaluating whether generally accepted
accounting principles require additional impairment of the underlying securities
or provisions for loan losses even where the risk of further  principal loss has
been  transferred and is borne by unaffiliated  parties.  The Company intends to
continue to discuss  this issue with  Deloitte & Touche LLP and will restate its
financial statements to make any necessary changes.

         The officers of the Company have  discussed  with Deloitte & Touche LLP
the matters disclosed in this report.


                                    SIGNATURE

           Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,
the  Registrant  has duly  caused  this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
