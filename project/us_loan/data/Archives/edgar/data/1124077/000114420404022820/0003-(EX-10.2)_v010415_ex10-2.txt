Consideration shall be subject to a lock-up period restricting  transfer of such
shares for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date (the  "Lock-Up  Period")
and each certificate  representing  such shares shall bear a restrictive  legend

end as to any shares covered by the registration statement to be filed by Parent
pursuant to this  Paragraph  simultaneously  with such shares  being sold by the
holder thereof pursuant to such  registration  statement after that registration
statement  has been  declared  effective by the SEC.  Upon  termination  of this
lock-up  arrangement  with respect to any shares,  the holder thereof may submit
the  certificate  evidencing  the same to  Parent  and  Parent  shall  cause the
restrictive legend to be removed from such certificate in respect of that number

action or agree to any  condition or incur any expense or liability  that might,
in the reasonable  judgment of Parent,  have a material adverse effect on Parent
or its  shareholders,  or that,  in the  reasonable  exercise  of the  fiduciary

Bioaccelerate,  Inc. prior to the date hereof,  Parent shall file, no later than
