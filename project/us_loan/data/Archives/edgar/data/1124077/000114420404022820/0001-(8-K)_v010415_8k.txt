SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

<PAGE>

(a) As previously announced,  on December 20, 2004, the Registrant completed the
merger (the  "Merger")  of Ardent  Acquisition  Corp.  ("AAC"),  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of the  Registrant,  with  and  into  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.
("Ardent"),  whereby  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has become a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  the  Registrant.  The  Merger  was  pursuant  to the  terms  and
conditions  of the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  dated  August  11,  2004 (the
"Agreement  and Plan of Merger") by and among The  Registrant,  AAC, and Ardent,
which was  previously  filed by the  Registrant  and is refiled as Exhibit  10.1
hereto,  as such  Agreement  and Plan of Merger was amended by  Amendment  No. 1
thereto dated November 20, 2004 ("Amendment No. 1") by and among The Registrant,
AAC, and Ardent,  which Amendment No. 1 is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current
Report  on Form  8-K.  The  Agreement  and Plan of  Merger,  as so  amended,  is
sometimes hereafter referred to as the "Agreement and Plan of Merger".

Except for certain  "Excluded  Shares" and  "Contingent  Fee Shares," as defined
below,  upon  the  conclusion  of the  Merger,  on a fully  diluted  basis,  the
Registrant's  shareholders who were  shareholders of the Registrant  immediately
prior to the Merger owned approximately fifty-five percent (55%), and the former
Ardent  securities  holders own approximately  forty-five  percent (45%), of the
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Registrant.

"Excluded  Shares"  include  any shares of Common  Stock that may be issued upon
exercise,  exchange or conversion of either (i) securities  sold in a "Qualified
Financing"  or (ii) a certain  warrant to purchase 1.5 million  shares of Common
Stock issued to Bioaccelerate,  Inc.  ("Bioaccelerate")  on August 11, 2004. The
Excluded  Shares were excluded from the calculation of aggregate share ownership
percentages  for the  Registrant's  shareholders  and former  Ardent  securities
holders set forth in the preceding  paragraph.  The Registrant has also reserved
shares of Common Stock (the  "Contingent Fee Shares") for issuance in settlement
of certain fee  arrangements  entered into by Ardent with its financial  advisor
for this transaction  (sometimes  hereinafter  referred to as "Century Capital).
The Contingent Fee Shares will reduce the number of shares which would otherwise
have been available to Ardent's shareholders as merger consideration. As used in
the Merger Agreement,  the term "Qualified  Financing" means an equity financing
by the Registrant of at least  $10,000,000 with a minimum  valuation of at least
$1.50 per share of Common Stock.

Upon the  effectiveness of the Merger,  each outstanding  share of Ardent common
and preferred stock was cancelled automatically and converted into shares of the
Registrant's   Common  Stock.   Also,  Ardent  options,   warrants  and  certain
convertible  notes which may be  exercised  or  converted  to receive  shares of
Ardent common stock,  were converted into securities (or  convertible  notes, in
the case of the  convertible  notes)  which may be  exercised  or  converted  to
receive shares of the  Registrant's  Common Stock.  In addition,  the Registrant
reserved for issuance  sufficient  shares to cover such exercises or conversions
as of the  conclusion  of the Merger (or at  maturity of the note in the case of
the  convertible  notes).  The shares of Common  Stock  issued or  reserved  for
issuance at the closing of the Merger are  sometimes  referred to as the "Merger
Shares."  The  Registrant  reserved  for  issuance  the  Contingent  Fee Shares,
consisting of 319,171  shares of Common Stock,  of which  approximately  234,171
shares are to be issued within fifteen (15) days subsequent to the  consummation
of the Merger and the balance may be issued upon the occurrence of certain other
events.

Ardent  securities  holders have the right to receive Merger Shares according to
the following  exchange  ratios  (rounded to 6 decimal places for example only),
which is subject to adjustment as provided below:

         Ardent                                                 Enhance
         ------                                                 -------
1 share Common Stock*              =     0.728920 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series A Preferred Stock*  =    10.413143 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series B Preferred Stock*  =     7.289198 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series C Preferred Stock*  =     0.801812 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 1 Preferred Stock =     1.228070 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 2 Preferred Stock =     0.842105 Shares of Enhance Common Stock


* The exchange  ratios for Ardent common stock as well as Ardent Series A, B and
C Preferred  Stock reflect the  completion of certain  transactions  pursuant to
which the Contingent Fee Shares are to be issued to Ardent's  financial advisor,
and assume that the entire amount of the Registrant's  Common Stock which may be
issued to Ardent's financial advisor is so issued.

<PAGE>

As a consequence,  upon the effectiveness of the Merger,  in the aggregate,  the
outstanding shares of Ardent common and preferred stock were converted into, and
the  outstanding   Ardent  options,   warrants  and  convertible   notes  became
exercisable  or convertible to receive,  approximately  the following  number of
shares of Enhance Common Stock:

              Ardent Common Stock**                   16,999,116 Shares
              Ardent Options**                         3,964,857 Shares
              Ardent Warrants*  *                        887,858 Shares
              Ardent Convertible Promissory Notes**      258,584 Shares
              Series A Preferred Stock**               1,251,139 Shares
              Series B Preferred Stock**                 875,797 Shares
              Series C Preferred Stock**                 801,812 Shares
              Series D 1 Preferred Stock               1,034,604 Shares
              Series D 2 Preferred Stock               2,187,340 Shares


** The number of shares of Registrant's  Common Stock allotted for Ardent common
stock,  as well as for Ardent  Series A, B and C  Preferred  Stock,  reflect the
completion of certain  transactions  pursuant to which the Contingent Fee Shares
are to be issued to  Ardent's  financial  advisor,  and  assume  that the entire
amount  of the  Registrant's  Common  Stock  which  may be  issued  to  Ardent's
financial advisor is so issued.

As a consequence of the  effectiveness of the Merger,  Ardent  securities are to
receive approximately  23,149,808  newly-issued Merger Shares, in the aggregate.
The  Registrant  has  reserved  approximately  5,111,299  Merger  Shares  in the
aggregate  for  issuance  upon  exercise of  outstanding  options,  warrants and
convertible  promissory notes of Ardent not exercised or terminated prior to the
Merger.  Approximately  319,171  Contingent  Fee Shares have been  reserved  for
issuance.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended, the Registrant entered
into a  Registration  Rights  Agreement,  dated as of  December  20,  2004  (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"),  the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to
this Current Report on Form 8-K. Pursuant to the Registration  Rights Agreement,
the Registrant has agreed to file a registration  statement under the Securities
Act to register up to 30,000 shares of the  Registrant's  Common Stock issued to
each Ardent  shareholder as merger  consideration as soon as practicable after a
Qualified  Financing,  but in no event later than 150 days following the closing
of the Merger.  Pursuant to the Registration  Rights  Agreement,  the Registrant
agreed to use its commercially  reasonable best efforts thereafter to cause such
registration  statement to be declared  effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission  ("SEC") as soon as  practicable  on or after the 180th day following
the  closing of the  Merger.  The  Registrant  agreed to  furnish  corresponding
registration rights to its existing  shareholders who do not have freely-trading
shares.  The Registrant also agreed that if the Common Stock is then listed on a
national stock  exchange,  the Registrant will file a listing  application  with
such  exchange,  and use its best  efforts to have  admitted  to trading on such
exchange  all shares of Common  Stock  issued to Ardent  shareholders  as merger
consideration that are covered by a registration  statement under the Securities
Act which has been declared  effective by the SEC. The Registrant  agreed to use
its  commercially  reasonable  best  efforts  to  keep  each  such  registration
statement  continuously  effective,  subject to customary  blackout  periods and
exceptions,  for one year  following the date upon which each such  registration
statement  is declared  effective  by the SEC (such period to be extended by the
duration of any such blackout  period or other period in which the  registration
statement does not continue to be effective).

<PAGE>

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,  as amended,  the Registrant  also
agreed to file with the SEC,  no later  than 180 days  after the  closing of the
Merger, a Registration Statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Common Stock
to be issued  upon  exercise  of  Ardent  stock  options  which  continue  to be
outstanding after the closing of the Merger, and to use its best efforts to have
such Registration  Statement become and remain continuously  effective under the
Securities Act. The Registrant agreed that if the Registrant is then listed on a
national stock exchange,  the Registrant shall file with such exchange a listing
application  and use its best  efforts to have such  shares  admitted to trading
thereon upon exercise of those stock options.  The Registrant  agreed to furnish
corresponding  registration  rights in  respect  of the  shares of Common  Stock
underlying  warrants or options held by Bioaccelerate,  Inc., the largest holder
of the Registrant's securities.  All but 1,500,000 of the underlying shares held
by   Bioaccelerate   will   continue  to  be  subject  to  a  12-month   lock-up
notwithstanding registration.

All shares of merger  consideration  issued to former  Ardent  security  holders
shall be  "restricted  shares" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the  "Securities  Act"),  and may not be freely  traded until either
covered  by an  effective  registration  statement  filed  with  the  SEC  under
applicable  laws (as well as any  corresponding  filings  which may be  required
under state or other  securities  laws) or disposed of pursuant to an  available
exemption to such registration,  and certificates evidencing such shares will be
legended accordingly.

In  addition,  pursuant to the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  as amended,  the
Registrant  obtained and delivered to Ardent  agreements by each holder of 5% or
more of the  Registrant's  outstanding  shares known to the  Registrant for each
such holder's shares of the Registrant's Common Stock to be subject to a lock-up
period  restricting  transfer of such shares for a period of 12 months after the
effectiveness  of the Merger,  with such  lock-up to end earlier with respect to
any shares covered by a registration  statement filed by the Registrant pursuant
to the  Securities  Act and  declared  effective  by the  SEC.  Pursuant  to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger,  Ardent  obtained and delivered to the  Registrant
agreements  by its officers and  directors  to cause  shares  underlying  Ardent
options to be subject to the same lock-up arrangements as those described above.

Notwithstanding the Registrant's agreements,  there can be no assurance that the
Registrant will ever file any such registration  statement and, even if so, that
any such  registration  statement  will  ever  become  effective,  or that  once
effective, such effectiveness will be maintained.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended,  at the effective time
of the Merger  the  following  individuals,  designated  by the former  board of
directors of Ardent, were elected to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors of
the Registrant:  Dr.  Kwen-Jen Chang (also known as Ken Chang),  Mr. Jinn Wu and
Mr. Timothy C. Gupton.

In  addition,  pursuant to the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  as amended,  Mr.
Christopher Every continues in his positions as a Director of the Registrant and
as the President and Chief Executive  Officer of the  Registrant,  and effective
upon the Merger the  Registrant  entered into an employment  agreement  with Mr.
Every, in the form filed as Exhibit 10.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (the
"Christopher  Every  Employment  Agreement").  The Christopher  Every Employment
Agreement is a three-year employment agreement which provides for an annual base
salary of $225,000, an annual bonus at the Board's discretion based on achieving
performance  targets,  and a stock  bonus equal to $35,000 on each of the first,
second and third anniversaries of the effective date of the Merger. Also, on the
effective date, pursuant to the Registrant's 2004 Incentive Plan, the Registrant
granted to Mr.  Every  options to purchase  1.4 million  shares of Common  Stock
subject to the following vesting schedule:  25% of options vested on the date of
grant and 25% will vest on each of the first,  second and third anniversaries of
the date of grant. If Mr. Every's  employment is terminated without cause by the
employer or for good reason by the executive, Mr. Every would be entitled to the
following: (i) continuing salary payments over a severance period of twelve (12)
months if terminated on or after the first  anniversary of the effective date of
the Merger or continuing  salary payments over a severance  period lasting until

expenses and benefits,  (iii)  continuing  coverage under employee benefit plans
during the severance  period,  and (iv) unvested options  scheduled to vest over
the severance period shall vest immediately upon termination.

In  accordance  with the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  as  amended,  upon the
effectiveness of the Merger, Dr. Kwen-Jen Chang (also known as Ken Chang) became
the  Chief  Science  Officer  and  President--Asia  Pacific  Operations  for the
Registrant,  and the  Registrant  entered into an employment  agreement with Dr.
Chang, in the form filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (the

<PAGE>

"Kwen-Jen Chang Employment Agreement").  The Kwen-Jen Chang Employment Agreement
is a three-year  term  employment  agreement  which  provides for an annual base
salary of $222,820,  eligibility to receive an annual  discretionary bonus based
on the attainment of performance  targets established by the Board of Directors,
and 1,000,000 options to purchase common stock of the Registrant,  which options
were granted upon the effective date of the Merger. The first 250,000, or 1/4 of
the aggregate  options granted,  were vested on December 20, 2004, the effective
date of the Merger. The remainder vest annually in three equal parts on the next
three  anniversaries.  If employment is terminated without cause by the employer
or for  good  reason  by the  executive,  Dr.  Chang  would be  entitled  to the
following: (i) continuing salary payments over a severance period of twelve (12)
months if terminated on or after the first  anniversary of the effective date of
the Merger or continuing  salary payments over a severance  period lasting until
the second  anniversary of the effective  date if terminated  prior to the first
anniversary of the effective  date,  (ii) any accrued but unpaid salary,  bonus,
expenses,  and benefits,  (iii) continuing coverage under employee benefit plans
during the severance  period,  and (iv) unvested options  scheduled to vest over
the severance period shall vest immediately upon termination.

Also  pursuant  to the  Agreement  and  Plan of  Merger,  as  amended,  upon the
effectiveness of the Merger,  Phillip S. Wise became the Chief Financial Officer
of the Registrant,  and the Registrant entered into an employment agreement with
Mr. Wise,  in the form filed as Exhibit 10.6 to this Current  Report on Form 8-K
(the "Phillip S. Wise  Employment  Agreement").  The Phillip S. Wise  Employment
Agreement is a three-year term employment agreement which provides for an annual
base salary of $225,000,  eligibility to receive an annual  discretionary  bonus
based on the  attainment  of  performance  targets  established  by the Board of

anniversaries  of the  effective  date of the  Merger and  1,200,000  options to

effective date of the Merger. The first 300,000, or 1/4 of the aggregate options
granted, were vested on December 20, 2004, the effective date of the Merger. The

SECTION 2. FINANCIAL INFORMATION

ITEM 2.01 COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

(a) As previously announced,  on December 20, 2004, the Registrant completed the
merger (the  "Merger")  of Ardent  Acquisition  Corp.  ("AAC"),  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of the  Registrant,  with  and  into  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.
("Ardent"),  whereby  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has become a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  the  Registrant.  The  Merger  was  pursuant  to the  terms  and
conditions  of the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  dated  August  11,  2004 (the
"Agreement  and Plan of Merger") by and among The  Registrant,  AAC, and Ardent,
which was  previously  filed by the  Registrant  and is refiled as Exhibit  10.1
hereto,  as such  Agreement  and Plan of Merger was amended by  Amendment  No. 1
thereto dated November 20, 2004 ("Amendment No. 1") by and among The Registrant,
AAC, and Ardent,  which Amendment No. 1 is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current
Report  on Form  8-K.  The  Agreement  and Plan of  Merger,  as so  amended,  is
sometimes hereafter referred to as the "Agreement and Plan of Merger".

(b) and (d) Except for certain "Excluded Shares" and "Contingent Fee Shares," as
defined below,  upon the conclusion of the Merger, on a fully diluted basis, the
Registrant's  shareholders who were  shareholders of the Registrant  immediately
prior to the Merger owned approximately fifty-five percent (55%), and the former
Ardent  securities  holders own approximately  forty-five  percent (45%), of the
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Registrant.

"Excluded  Shares"  include  any shares of Common  Stock that may be issued upon
exercise,  exchange or conversion of either (i) securities  sold in a "Qualified
Financing"  or (ii) a certain  warrant to purchase 1.5 million  shares of Common
Stock issued to Bioaccelerate,  Inc.  ("Bioaccelerate")  on August 11, 2004. The
Excluded  Shares were excluded from the calculation of aggregate share ownership
percentages  for the  Registrant's  shareholders  and former  Ardent  securities
holders set forth in the preceding  paragraph.  The Registrant has also reserved
shares of Common Stock (the  "Contingent Fee Shares") for issuance in settlement
of certain fee  arrangements  entered into by Ardent with its financial  advisor
for this transaction  (sometimes  hereinafter  referred to as "Century Capital).
The Contingent Fee Shares will reduce the number of shares which would otherwise
have been available to Ardent's shareholders as merger consideration. As used in
the Merger Agreement,  the term "Qualified  Financing" means an equity financing
by the Registrant of at least  $10,000,000 with a minimum  valuation of at least
$1.50 per share of Common Stock.

<PAGE>

Upon the  effectiveness of the Merger,  each outstanding  share of Ardent common
and preferred stock was cancelled automatically and converted into shares of the
Registrant's   Common  Stock.   Also,  Ardent  options,   warrants  and  certain
convertible  notes which may be  exercised  or  converted  to receive  shares of
Ardent common stock,  were converted into securities (or  convertible  notes, in
the case of the  convertible  notes)  which may be  exercised  or  converted  to
receive shares of the  Registrant's  Common Stock.  In addition,  the Registrant
reserved for issuance  sufficient  shares to cover such exercises or conversions
as of the  conclusion  of the Merger (or at  maturity of the note in the case of
the  convertible  notes).  The shares of Common  Stock  issued or  reserved  for
issuance at the closing of the Merger are  sometimes  referred to as the "Merger
Shares."  The  Registrant  reserved  for  issuance  the  Contingent  Fee Shares,
consisting of 319,171  shares of Common Stock,  of which  approximately  234,171
shares are to be issued within fifteen (15) days subsequent to the  consummation
of the Merger and the balance may be issued upon the occurrence of certain other
events.

Ardent  securities  holders have the right to receive Merger Shares according to
the following  exchange  ratios  (rounded to 6 decimal places for example only),
which is subject to adjustment as provided below:

         Ardent                                                 Enhance
          -----                                                 --------
1 share Common Stock*              =    0.728920 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series A Preferred Stock*  =   10.413143 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series B Preferred Stock*  =    7.289198 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series C Preferred Stock*  =    0.801812 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 1 Preferred Stock =    1.228070 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 2 Preferred Stock =    0.842105 Shares of Enhance Common Stock


* The exchange  ratios for Ardent common stock as well as Ardent Series A, B and
C Preferred  Stock reflect the  completion of certain  transactions  pursuant to
which the Contingent Fee Shares are to be issued to Ardent's  financial advisor,
and assume that the entire amount of the Registrant's  Common Stock which may be
issued to Ardent's financial advisor is so issued.

As a consequence,  upon the effectiveness of the Merger,  in the aggregate,  the
outstanding shares of Ardent common and preferred stock were converted into, and
the  outstanding   Ardent  options,   warrants  and  convertible   notes  became
exercisable  or convertible to receive,  approximately  the following  number of
shares of Enhance Common Stock:

               Ardent Common Stock**                       16,999,116 Shares
               Ardent Options**                             3,964,857 Shares
               Ardent Warrants*  *                            887,858 Shares
               Ardent Convertible Promissory Notes**          258,584 Shares
               Series A Preferred Stock**                   1,251,139 Shares
               Series B Preferred Stock**                     875,797 Shares
