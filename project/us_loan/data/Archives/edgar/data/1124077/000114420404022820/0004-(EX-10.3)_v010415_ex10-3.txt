covered by such Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such
other federal or state governmental  agencies or authorities as may be necessary

Registrable Securities (provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to
qualify  as a  foreign  corporation  to  do  business  under  the  laws  of  any
jurisdiction  in  which  it is  not  then  qualified),  and  maintain  any  such
registration  or  qualification  current  until the  earlier  of the sale of the

the purpose of due diligence  with respect to the  registration  statement,  all
publicly  available,  non-confidential  financial and other  records,  including
without limitation  pertinent  corporate documents of Parent, and cause Parent's
officers,  directors and employees to supply, at the requesting  parties expense
and without unreasonable disruption of Parent's business or unreasonable expense
to parent and  solely  for the  purpose  of due  diligence  with  respect to the
registration  statement,  all publicly available,  non-confidential  information
reasonably  requested by the  attorney,  accountant or other agent of any of the
Holders;

            3.2 It shall be a condition  precedent to the  obligations of Parent
to take any action  pursuant to this  Agreement  that each of the Holders  whose
Registrable  Securities are to be registered  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall
furnish  the  following  to  Parent  prior  to  performance  by  Parent  of  its
obligations under this Agreement:

<PAGE>

                  (b)  information  regarding each such Holder,  the Registrable
Securities held by such Holder,  and any additional  information as Parent shall
reasonably  request and as shall be required in connection with the action to be
taken by Parent;

                  (c) written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of each
such  Holder's  agreement  to provide  customary  indemnifications  to Parent in
respect of information furnished by or on behalf of each Holder or actions taken
or omitted by each Holder (as consistent with the indemnification  provisions of
this  Agreement),  and to pay the Individual  Holder Expenses  incurred by or on
behalf of each Holder which are not Registration Expenses required to be paid by
Parent  hereunder,  and to customary  blackout  periods in the event of material
corporate developments affecting Parent or its securities; and

                  (d) written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of each
Holder's  agreement  that  upon  receipt  of any  written  notice  by  Parent to
discontinue  use of the  registration  statement  or any  prospectus  or related
document until the same are supplemented or amended, that Holder will so refrain
and,  if so directed by Parent,  will  deliver to Parent all copies,  other than
permanent file copies, then in Holder's possession of such documents at the time
of receipt of such  notice.  Furthermore,  each Holder  shall agree that if such
Holder uses a prospectus in connection  with the offering and sale of any of the
Registrable  Securities,  the Holder  will use only the  latest  version of such
prospectus provided by Parent.

      4. Expenses.  All  Registration  Expenses  incurred in connection with any
registration,  qualification or compliance  pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 of this
Agreement shall be borne by Parent.

      5. Indemnification.

            5.1  Indemnification by Parent. To the full extent permitted by law,
Parent  will  indemnify  each  Holder,  each  of  its  officers,  directors  and
employees,  and each  person  controlling  a Holder  within  the  meaning of the
Securities Act, with respect to which registration,  qualification or compliance
has been effected pursuant to this Agreement against all claims, losses, damages
and  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings or  settlements in respect  thereof)
arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of
a material fact contained in any prospectus, offering circular or other document
(including  any  related  registration  statement,  notification  or  the  like)
incident to any such registration,  qualification or compliance, or based on any
omission (or alleged  omission) to state  therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not  misleading,  or
any  violation  by  Parent  of the  Securities  Act or any  rule  or  regulation
thereunder  applicable to Parent and relating to action or inaction  required of
Parent in connection with any such  registration,  qualification  or compliance,
and will  reimburse  each  such  Holder,  each of its  officers,  directors  and
partners,  and each person  controlling  such Holder for any legal and any other
expenses  reasonably  incurred in connection with investigating and defending or
settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that Parent
will not be liable in any such case to the  extent  that any such  claim,  loss,
damage,  liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue  statement
or omission made in reliance upon and based upon written  information  furnished
to Parent by or on behalf of such Holder for use therein.

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

            5.2 Indemnification by the Holders.  Each Holder will, to the extent
Registrable  Securities  held  by  him or it are  included  in the  Registration
Statement,  indemnify Parent, each of its directors,  officers and employees and
each other  person,  if any,  who  controls  Parent  within  the  meaning of the
Securities Act, against all claims,  losses,  damages,  expenses and liabilities
(or actions in respect  thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement
(or  alleged  untrue  statement)  of a  material  fact  contained  in  any  such
Registration Statement,  Prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any
omission (or alleged  omission) to state  therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not  misleading,  or
any  violation by such Holder of the  Securities  Act or any rule or  regulation
thereunder applicable to such Holder and relating to action or inaction required
of such  Holder  in  connection  with any such  registration,  qualification  or
compliance,  and will  reimburse  Parent,  each of its  directors,  officers and
employees and each other person for any legal or any other  expenses  reasonably
incurred in connection  with  investigating  or defending any such claim,  loss,
damage,  liability  or action,  in each case with respect to any such alleged or
actual  untrue  statement  of a material  fact or alleged or actual  omission to
state a material  fact to the extent,  but only to the extent,  that such untrue
statement (or alleged  untrue  statement)  or omission (or alleged  omission) is
made in such  Registration  Statement,  Prospectus,  offering  circular or other
document in reliance upon and in conformity with written  information  furnished
to Parent by such Holder for use therein.

            5.3  Notices of Claims,  Procedures,  etc.  Each party  entitled  to
indemnification under this Section 5 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice
to the party  required to provide  indemnification  (the  "Indemnifying  Party")
promptly after such  Indemnified  Party has actual  knowledge of any claim as to
which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
the defense of any such claim or any litigation  resulting  therefrom,  provided
that the  Indemnified  Party may  participate in such defense at the Indemnified
Party's sole expense,  and provided  further that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its  obligations  under this Section 5 unless such failure is  prejudicial to
the   ability   of   Indemnifying   Party  to  defend   such  claim  or  action.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  such Indemnified  Party shall have the right to
employ its own counsel in any such litigation, proceeding or other action if (i)
the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Indemnifying Party, in
its sole and absolute  discretion,  or (ii) the named parties in any such claims
(including any impleaded  parties)  include any such  Indemnified  Party and the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party shall have been advised in writing
(in suitable  detail) by counsel to the Indemnified  Party either (A) that there
may be one or more legal defenses  available to such Indemnified Party which are
different from or additional to those  available to the  Indemnifying  Party, or
(B) that there is a conflict of interest by virtue of the Indemnified  Party and
the  Indemnifying  Parties having common  counsel,  in any of which events,  the
reasonable  legal fees and  expenses  of a single  counsel  for all  Indemnified
Parties  with  respect to each such claim,  defense  thereof,  or  counterclaims
thereto shall be borne by  Indemnifying  Party.  No  Indemnifying  Party, in the
defense of any such claim or litigation,  shall, except with the consent of each
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,  consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement  which does not include as an
unconditional  term  thereof  the giving by the  claimant or  plaintiff  to such
Indemnified  Party of a release  from all  liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.  Each  Indemnified  Party shall  cooperate to the extent  reasonably
required and furnish such information  regarding itself or the claim in question
as an  Indemnifying  Party may  reasonably  request in  writing  and as shall be
reasonably  required in  connection  with  defense of such claim and  litigation
resulting therefrom.

                                      -23-

            5.4  Contribution.  If the  indemnification  provided  for  in  this
Section  5 shall  for any  reason  be held by a court to be  unenforceable  as a
matter of public policy with respect to an  Indemnified  Party in respect of any
loss,  claim,  damage,  expense or liability,  or any action in respect thereof,
then,  in lieu of the amount paid or payable  under  Section 5.1 or Section 5.2,
the Indemnified  Party and the  Indemnifying  Party under Section 5.1 or Section
5.2 shall  contribute to the aggregate  losses,  claims,  damages,  expenses and
liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with  investigating  the same),  (a) in such  proportion  as is  appropriate  to
reflect the  relative  fault of the  Indemnified  Party and  Indemnifying  Party
covered by the  registration  statement  which  resulted  in such  loss,  claim,
damage,  expense or liability,  or action or proceeding in respect thereof, with
respect to the  statements  or  omissions  which  resulted in such loss,  claim,
damage,  expense or liability,  or action or proceeding in respect  thereof,  as
well as any other  relevant  equitable  considerations  or (b) if the allocation
provided  by clause  (a)  above is not  permitted  by  applicable  law,  in such
proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative  benefits received by
the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party from the offering of the securities
covered by such  registration  statement;  provided,  that for  purposes of this
clause (b), the relative benefits  received by the prospective  sellers shall be
deemed  not to  exceed  the  amount of  proceeds  received  by such  prospective
sellers. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution  from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Such prospective
sellers'  obligations  to contribute as provided in this Section 5.4 are several
in proportion to the relative value of their respective  Registrable  Securities
covered by such  registration  statement and not joint.  In addition,  no person
shall be  obligated  to  contribute  hereunder  any  amounts in payment  for any
settlement of any action or claim effected without such person's consent,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      6. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

      7.  Exchange  Act  Compliance.  While  Parent is subject to the  reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act, Parent shall make commercially reasonable best
efforts to file the reports  required to be filed by it under the Securities Act
and the Exchange  Act and the rules and  regulations  adopted by the  Commission
thereunder,  and to take all actions  reasonably  necessary to enable Holders of
Registrable  Securities to sell such securities  without  registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the provisions of (a) Rule 144 under the
Securities  Act,  as such Rule may be amended  from time to time,  (b) Rule 144A
under the  Securities  Act,  as such Rule may be amended  from time to time,  if
applicable  or (c) any similar  rules or  regulations  hereunder  adopted by the
Commission.  Upon the request of any Holder of  Registrable  Securities,  Parent
will  deliver to such holder a written  statement  as to whether it has complied
with such requirements.

      8. Specific Performance.  The parties hereto acknowledge that there may be
no adequate  remedy at law if any party fails to perform any of its  obligations
hereunder and that each party may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and
accordingly  agree that each party,  in addition to any other remedy to which it
may be  entitled  at law or in  equity,  shall  be  entitled  to seek to  compel
specific  performance of the obligations of any other party under this Agreement
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

not after the date hereof enter into any agreement granting  registration rights
with respect to any of its securities outstanding on the date hereof, except (i)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (ii) registration rights for Parent's existing
shareholders  who do not have  freely  tradable  shares  on the date  hereof  as

inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns
of each of the  parties  and shall  inure to the benefit of each Holder and each
Holder  shall be an  intended  third  party  beneficiary  under this  Agreement.

      11.   Complete   Agreement.   This  Agreement   constitutes  the  complete
understanding  among  the  parties  with  respect  to  its  subject  matter  and
supersedes all existing agreements and understandings,  whether oral or written,
among them. No alteration or  modification  of any  provisions of this Agreement
shall be valid  unless  made in  writing  and  signed,  on the one hand,  by the
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding and, on the
other, by Parent.

      12. Section Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
