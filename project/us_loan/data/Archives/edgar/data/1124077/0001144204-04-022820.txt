SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

<PAGE>

(a) As previously announced,  on December 20, 2004, the Registrant completed the
merger (the  "Merger")  of Ardent  Acquisition  Corp.  ("AAC"),  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of the  Registrant,  with  and  into  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.
("Ardent"),  whereby  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has become a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  the  Registrant.  The  Merger  was  pursuant  to the  terms  and
conditions  of the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  dated  August  11,  2004 (the
"Agreement  and Plan of Merger") by and among The  Registrant,  AAC, and Ardent,
which was  previously  filed by the  Registrant  and is refiled as Exhibit  10.1
hereto,  as such  Agreement  and Plan of Merger was amended by  Amendment  No. 1
thereto dated November 20, 2004 ("Amendment No. 1") by and among The Registrant,
AAC, and Ardent,  which Amendment No. 1 is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current
Report  on Form  8-K.  The  Agreement  and Plan of  Merger,  as so  amended,  is
sometimes hereafter referred to as the "Agreement and Plan of Merger".

Except for certain  "Excluded  Shares" and  "Contingent  Fee Shares," as defined
below,  upon  the  conclusion  of the  Merger,  on a fully  diluted  basis,  the
Registrant's  shareholders who were  shareholders of the Registrant  immediately
prior to the Merger owned approximately fifty-five percent (55%), and the former
Ardent  securities  holders own approximately  forty-five  percent (45%), of the
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Registrant.

"Excluded  Shares"  include  any shares of Common  Stock that may be issued upon
exercise,  exchange or conversion of either (i) securities  sold in a "Qualified
Financing"  or (ii) a certain  warrant to purchase 1.5 million  shares of Common
Stock issued to Bioaccelerate,  Inc.  ("Bioaccelerate")  on August 11, 2004. The
Excluded  Shares were excluded from the calculation of aggregate share ownership
percentages  for the  Registrant's  shareholders  and former  Ardent  securities
holders set forth in the preceding  paragraph.  The Registrant has also reserved
shares of Common Stock (the  "Contingent Fee Shares") for issuance in settlement
of certain fee  arrangements  entered into by Ardent with its financial  advisor
for this transaction  (sometimes  hereinafter  referred to as "Century Capital).
The Contingent Fee Shares will reduce the number of shares which would otherwise
have been available to Ardent's shareholders as merger consideration. As used in
the Merger Agreement,  the term "Qualified  Financing" means an equity financing
by the Registrant of at least  $10,000,000 with a minimum  valuation of at least
$1.50 per share of Common Stock.

Upon the  effectiveness of the Merger,  each outstanding  share of Ardent common
and preferred stock was cancelled automatically and converted into shares of the
Registrant's   Common  Stock.   Also,  Ardent  options,   warrants  and  certain
convertible  notes which may be  exercised  or  converted  to receive  shares of
Ardent common stock,  were converted into securities (or  convertible  notes, in
the case of the  convertible  notes)  which may be  exercised  or  converted  to
receive shares of the  Registrant's  Common Stock.  In addition,  the Registrant
reserved for issuance  sufficient  shares to cover such exercises or conversions
as of the  conclusion  of the Merger (or at  maturity of the note in the case of
the  convertible  notes).  The shares of Common  Stock  issued or  reserved  for
issuance at the closing of the Merger are  sometimes  referred to as the "Merger
Shares."  The  Registrant  reserved  for  issuance  the  Contingent  Fee Shares,
consisting of 319,171  shares of Common Stock,  of which  approximately  234,171
shares are to be issued within fifteen (15) days subsequent to the  consummation
of the Merger and the balance may be issued upon the occurrence of certain other
events.

Ardent  securities  holders have the right to receive Merger Shares according to
the following  exchange  ratios  (rounded to 6 decimal places for example only),
which is subject to adjustment as provided below:

         Ardent                                                 Enhance
         ------                                                 -------
1 share Common Stock*              =     0.728920 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series A Preferred Stock*  =    10.413143 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series B Preferred Stock*  =     7.289198 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series C Preferred Stock*  =     0.801812 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 1 Preferred Stock =     1.228070 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 2 Preferred Stock =     0.842105 Shares of Enhance Common Stock


* The exchange  ratios for Ardent common stock as well as Ardent Series A, B and
C Preferred  Stock reflect the  completion of certain  transactions  pursuant to
which the Contingent Fee Shares are to be issued to Ardent's  financial advisor,
and assume that the entire amount of the Registrant's  Common Stock which may be
issued to Ardent's financial advisor is so issued.

<PAGE>

As a consequence,  upon the effectiveness of the Merger,  in the aggregate,  the
outstanding shares of Ardent common and preferred stock were converted into, and
the  outstanding   Ardent  options,   warrants  and  convertible   notes  became
exercisable  or convertible to receive,  approximately  the following  number of
shares of Enhance Common Stock:

              Ardent Common Stock**                   16,999,116 Shares
              Ardent Options**                         3,964,857 Shares
              Ardent Warrants*  *                        887,858 Shares
              Ardent Convertible Promissory Notes**      258,584 Shares
              Series A Preferred Stock**               1,251,139 Shares
              Series B Preferred Stock**                 875,797 Shares
              Series C Preferred Stock**                 801,812 Shares
              Series D 1 Preferred Stock               1,034,604 Shares
              Series D 2 Preferred Stock               2,187,340 Shares


** The number of shares of Registrant's  Common Stock allotted for Ardent common
stock,  as well as for Ardent  Series A, B and C  Preferred  Stock,  reflect the
completion of certain  transactions  pursuant to which the Contingent Fee Shares
are to be issued to  Ardent's  financial  advisor,  and  assume  that the entire
amount  of the  Registrant's  Common  Stock  which  may be  issued  to  Ardent's
financial advisor is so issued.

As a consequence of the  effectiveness of the Merger,  Ardent  securities are to
receive approximately  23,149,808  newly-issued Merger Shares, in the aggregate.
The  Registrant  has  reserved  approximately  5,111,299  Merger  Shares  in the
aggregate  for  issuance  upon  exercise of  outstanding  options,  warrants and
convertible  promissory notes of Ardent not exercised or terminated prior to the
Merger.  Approximately  319,171  Contingent  Fee Shares have been  reserved  for
issuance.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended, the Registrant entered
into a  Registration  Rights  Agreement,  dated as of  December  20,  2004  (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"),  the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to
this Current Report on Form 8-K. Pursuant to the Registration  Rights Agreement,
the Registrant has agreed to file a registration  statement under the Securities
Act to register up to 30,000 shares of the  Registrant's  Common Stock issued to
each Ardent  shareholder as merger  consideration as soon as practicable after a
Qualified  Financing,  but in no event later than 150 days following the closing
of the Merger.  Pursuant to the Registration  Rights  Agreement,  the Registrant
agreed to use its commercially  reasonable best efforts thereafter to cause such
registration  statement to be declared  effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission  ("SEC") as soon as  practicable  on or after the 180th day following
the  closing of the  Merger.  The  Registrant  agreed to  furnish  corresponding
registration rights to its existing  shareholders who do not have freely-trading
shares.  The Registrant also agreed that if the Common Stock is then listed on a
national stock  exchange,  the Registrant will file a listing  application  with
such  exchange,  and use its best  efforts to have  admitted  to trading on such
exchange  all shares of Common  Stock  issued to Ardent  shareholders  as merger
consideration that are covered by a registration  statement under the Securities
Act which has been declared  effective by the SEC. The Registrant  agreed to use
its  commercially  reasonable  best  efforts  to  keep  each  such  registration
statement  continuously  effective,  subject to customary  blackout  periods and
exceptions,  for one year  following the date upon which each such  registration
statement  is declared  effective  by the SEC (such period to be extended by the
duration of any such blackout  period or other period in which the  registration
statement does not continue to be effective).

<PAGE>

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,  as amended,  the Registrant  also
agreed to file with the SEC,  no later  than 180 days  after the  closing of the
Merger, a Registration Statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Common Stock
to be issued  upon  exercise  of  Ardent  stock  options  which  continue  to be
outstanding after the closing of the Merger, and to use its best efforts to have
such Registration  Statement become and remain continuously  effective under the
Securities Act. The Registrant agreed that if the Registrant is then listed on a
national stock exchange,  the Registrant shall file with such exchange a listing
application  and use its best  efforts to have such  shares  admitted to trading
thereon upon exercise of those stock options.  The Registrant  agreed to furnish
corresponding  registration  rights in  respect  of the  shares of Common  Stock
underlying  warrants or options held by Bioaccelerate,  Inc., the largest holder
of the Registrant's securities.  All but 1,500,000 of the underlying shares held
by   Bioaccelerate   will   continue  to  be  subject  to  a  12-month   lock-up
notwithstanding registration.

All shares of merger  consideration  issued to former  Ardent  security  holders
shall be  "restricted  shares" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the  "Securities  Act"),  and may not be freely  traded until either
covered  by an  effective  registration  statement  filed  with  the  SEC  under
applicable  laws (as well as any  corresponding  filings  which may be  required
under state or other  securities  laws) or disposed of pursuant to an  available
exemption to such registration,  and certificates evidencing such shares will be
legended accordingly.

In  addition,  pursuant to the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  as amended,  the
Registrant  obtained and delivered to Ardent  agreements by each holder of 5% or
more of the  Registrant's  outstanding  shares known to the  Registrant for each
such holder's shares of the Registrant's Common Stock to be subject to a lock-up
period  restricting  transfer of such shares for a period of 12 months after the
effectiveness  of the Merger,  with such  lock-up to end earlier with respect to
any shares covered by a registration  statement filed by the Registrant pursuant
to the  Securities  Act and  declared  effective  by the  SEC.  Pursuant  to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger,  Ardent  obtained and delivered to the  Registrant
agreements  by its officers and  directors  to cause  shares  underlying  Ardent
options to be subject to the same lock-up arrangements as those described above.

Notwithstanding the Registrant's agreements,  there can be no assurance that the
Registrant will ever file any such registration  statement and, even if so, that
any such  registration  statement  will  ever  become  effective,  or that  once
effective, such effectiveness will be maintained.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended,  at the effective time
of the Merger  the  following  individuals,  designated  by the former  board of
directors of Ardent, were elected to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors of
the Registrant:  Dr.  Kwen-Jen Chang (also known as Ken Chang),  Mr. Jinn Wu and
Mr. Timothy C. Gupton.

In  addition,  pursuant to the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  as amended,  Mr.
Christopher Every continues in his positions as a Director of the Registrant and
as the President and Chief Executive  Officer of the  Registrant,  and effective
upon the Merger the  Registrant  entered into an employment  agreement  with Mr.
Every, in the form filed as Exhibit 10.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (the
"Christopher  Every  Employment  Agreement").  The Christopher  Every Employment
Agreement is a three-year employment agreement which provides for an annual base
salary of $225,000, an annual bonus at the Board's discretion based on achieving
performance  targets,  and a stock  bonus equal to $35,000 on each of the first,
second and third anniversaries of the effective date of the Merger. Also, on the
effective date, pursuant to the Registrant's 2004 Incentive Plan, the Registrant
granted to Mr.  Every  options to purchase  1.4 million  shares of Common  Stock
subject to the following vesting schedule:  25% of options vested on the date of
grant and 25% will vest on each of the first,  second and third anniversaries of
the date of grant. If Mr. Every's  employment is terminated without cause by the
employer or for good reason by the executive, Mr. Every would be entitled to the
following: (i) continuing salary payments over a severance period of twelve (12)
months if terminated on or after the first  anniversary of the effective date of
the Merger or continuing  salary payments over a severance  period lasting until
the second  anniversary of the effective  date if terminated  prior to the first
anniversary of the effective  date,  (ii) any accrued but unpaid salary,  bonus,
expenses and benefits,  (iii)  continuing  coverage under employee benefit plans
during the severance  period,  and (iv) unvested options  scheduled to vest over
the severance period shall vest immediately upon termination.

In  accordance  with the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  as  amended,  upon the
effectiveness of the Merger, Dr. Kwen-Jen Chang (also known as Ken Chang) became
the  Chief  Science  Officer  and  President--Asia  Pacific  Operations  for the
Registrant,  and the  Registrant  entered into an employment  agreement with Dr.
Chang, in the form filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (the

<PAGE>

"Kwen-Jen Chang Employment Agreement").  The Kwen-Jen Chang Employment Agreement
is a three-year  term  employment  agreement  which  provides for an annual base
salary of $222,820,  eligibility to receive an annual  discretionary bonus based
on the attainment of performance  targets established by the Board of Directors,
and 1,000,000 options to purchase common stock of the Registrant,  which options
were granted upon the effective date of the Merger. The first 250,000, or 1/4 of
the aggregate  options granted,  were vested on December 20, 2004, the effective
date of the Merger. The remainder vest annually in three equal parts on the next
three  anniversaries.  If employment is terminated without cause by the employer
or for  good  reason  by the  executive,  Dr.  Chang  would be  entitled  to the
following: (i) continuing salary payments over a severance period of twelve (12)
months if terminated on or after the first  anniversary of the effective date of
the Merger or continuing  salary payments over a severance  period lasting until
the second  anniversary of the effective  date if terminated  prior to the first
anniversary of the effective  date,  (ii) any accrued but unpaid salary,  bonus,
expenses,  and benefits,  (iii) continuing coverage under employee benefit plans
during the severance  period,  and (iv) unvested options  scheduled to vest over
the severance period shall vest immediately upon termination.

Also  pursuant  to the  Agreement  and  Plan of  Merger,  as  amended,  upon the
effectiveness of the Merger,  Phillip S. Wise became the Chief Financial Officer
of the Registrant,  and the Registrant entered into an employment agreement with
Mr. Wise,  in the form filed as Exhibit 10.6 to this Current  Report on Form 8-K
(the "Phillip S. Wise  Employment  Agreement").  The Phillip S. Wise  Employment
Agreement is a three-year term employment agreement which provides for an annual
base salary of $225,000,  eligibility to receive an annual  discretionary  bonus
based on the  attainment  of  performance  targets  established  by the Board of
Directors,  stock  bonus  equivalent  to  $35,000  on  each of the  first  three
anniversaries  of the  effective  date of the  Merger and  1,200,000  options to
purchase  common stock of the  Registrant,  which  options were granted upon the
effective date of the Merger. The first 300,000, or 1/4 of the aggregate options
granted, were vested on December 20, 2004, the effective date of the Merger. The
remainder vest annually in three equal parts on the next three anniversaries. If
employment is terminated without cause by the employer or for good reason by the
executive,  Mr. Wise would be entitled to the following:  (i) continuing  salary
payments over a severance period of twelve (12) months if terminated on or after
the first  anniversary of the effective date of the Merger or continuing  salary

date, (ii) any accrued but unpaid salary, bonus, expenses,  and benefits,  (iii)
continuing  coverage under employee  benefit plans during the severance  period,
and (iv) unvested options scheduled to vest over the severance period shall vest
immediately upon termination.

SECTION 2. FINANCIAL INFORMATION

ITEM 2.01 COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

(a) As previously announced,  on December 20, 2004, the Registrant completed the
merger (the  "Merger")  of Ardent  Acquisition  Corp.  ("AAC"),  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of the  Registrant,  with  and  into  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.
("Ardent"),  whereby  Ardent  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has become a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  the  Registrant.  The  Merger  was  pursuant  to the  terms  and
conditions  of the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  dated  August  11,  2004 (the
"Agreement  and Plan of Merger") by and among The  Registrant,  AAC, and Ardent,
which was  previously  filed by the  Registrant  and is refiled as Exhibit  10.1
hereto,  as such  Agreement  and Plan of Merger was amended by  Amendment  No. 1
thereto dated November 20, 2004 ("Amendment No. 1") by and among The Registrant,
AAC, and Ardent,  which Amendment No. 1 is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current
Report  on Form  8-K.  The  Agreement  and Plan of  Merger,  as so  amended,  is
sometimes hereafter referred to as the "Agreement and Plan of Merger".

(b) and (d) Except for certain "Excluded Shares" and "Contingent Fee Shares," as
defined below,  upon the conclusion of the Merger, on a fully diluted basis, the
Registrant's  shareholders who were  shareholders of the Registrant  immediately
prior to the Merger owned approximately fifty-five percent (55%), and the former
Ardent  securities  holders own approximately  forty-five  percent (45%), of the
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Registrant.

"Excluded  Shares"  include  any shares of Common  Stock that may be issued upon
exercise,  exchange or conversion of either (i) securities  sold in a "Qualified
Financing"  or (ii) a certain  warrant to purchase 1.5 million  shares of Common
Stock issued to Bioaccelerate,  Inc.  ("Bioaccelerate")  on August 11, 2004. The
Excluded  Shares were excluded from the calculation of aggregate share ownership
percentages  for the  Registrant's  shareholders  and former  Ardent  securities
holders set forth in the preceding  paragraph.  The Registrant has also reserved
shares of Common Stock (the  "Contingent Fee Shares") for issuance in settlement
of certain fee  arrangements  entered into by Ardent with its financial  advisor
for this transaction  (sometimes  hereinafter  referred to as "Century Capital).
The Contingent Fee Shares will reduce the number of shares which would otherwise
have been available to Ardent's shareholders as merger consideration. As used in
the Merger Agreement,  the term "Qualified  Financing" means an equity financing
by the Registrant of at least  $10,000,000 with a minimum  valuation of at least
$1.50 per share of Common Stock.

<PAGE>

Upon the  effectiveness of the Merger,  each outstanding  share of Ardent common
and preferred stock was cancelled automatically and converted into shares of the
Registrant's   Common  Stock.   Also,  Ardent  options,   warrants  and  certain
convertible  notes which may be  exercised  or  converted  to receive  shares of
Ardent common stock,  were converted into securities (or  convertible  notes, in
the case of the  convertible  notes)  which may be  exercised  or  converted  to
receive shares of the  Registrant's  Common Stock.  In addition,  the Registrant
reserved for issuance  sufficient  shares to cover such exercises or conversions
as of the  conclusion  of the Merger (or at  maturity of the note in the case of
the  convertible  notes).  The shares of Common  Stock  issued or  reserved  for
issuance at the closing of the Merger are  sometimes  referred to as the "Merger
Shares."  The  Registrant  reserved  for  issuance  the  Contingent  Fee Shares,
consisting of 319,171  shares of Common Stock,  of which  approximately  234,171
shares are to be issued within fifteen (15) days subsequent to the  consummation
of the Merger and the balance may be issued upon the occurrence of certain other
events.

          -----                                                 --------
1 share Common Stock*              =    0.728920 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series A Preferred Stock*  =   10.413143 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series B Preferred Stock*  =    7.289198 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series C Preferred Stock*  =    0.801812 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 1 Preferred Stock =    1.228070 Shares of Enhance Common Stock
1 share Series D 2 Preferred Stock =    0.842105 Shares of Enhance Common Stock


* The exchange  ratios for Ardent common stock as well as Ardent Series A, B and

which the Contingent Fee Shares are to be issued to Ardent's  financial advisor,
and assume that the entire amount of the Registrant's  Common Stock which may be
issued to Ardent's financial advisor is so issued.

As a consequence,  upon the effectiveness of the Merger,  in the aggregate,  the
outstanding shares of Ardent common and preferred stock were converted into, and
the  outstanding   Ardent  options,   warrants  and  convertible   notes  became
exercisable  or convertible to receive,  approximately  the following  number of
shares of Enhance Common Stock:

               Ardent Common Stock**                       16,999,116 Shares
               Ardent Options**                             3,964,857 Shares

               Series D 2 Preferred Stock                   2,187,340 Shares


** The number of shares of Registrant's  Common Stock allotted for Ardent common
stock,  as well as for Ardent  Series A, B and C  Preferred  Stock,  reflect the
completion of certain  transactions  pursuant to which the Contingent Fee Shares
are to be issued to  Ardent's  financial  advisor,  and  assume  that the entire
amount  of the  Registrant's  Common  Stock  which  may be  issued  to  Ardent's
financial advisor is so issued.

WHEREAS,  each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire Parent to consummate
a business combination with the Company in a transaction whereby, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the  Company  (the  "Merger"),  each  outstanding  share of common

converted  into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger  Consideration  and
each  outstanding  share of  preferred  stock of the Company  (other than shares
cancelled and retired pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting  Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration,  and the
Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger;

WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of the Company has determined and resolved that
the Merger and all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the
best  interest of the  holders of Company  Common  Stock and  Company  Preferred
Stock, that the Merger is fair and advisable, and has approved this Agreement in

Stock and Company  Preferred Stock that they  authorize,  approve and adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and

WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of Parent has  determined and resolved that the

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby  acknowledged,  the parties  hereto,  intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

Company  Stock  Certificates.  In the event  that a holder  of a  Company  Stock
Certificate  would be  entitled  to  receive in the  Merger a  fractional  share
interest in  exchange  for such  Company  Stock  Certificate,  then (i) any such
fractional  share  greater  than or equal to  one-half of a share (0.5) shall be

      SECTION 2.3 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

            (A) As soon as reasonably  practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with Parent's transfer agent, Liberty Stock Transfer,  or a
nationally  reputable  bank or trust  company  in the  United  States  as may be

pursuant to Section 2.1 less the merger  consideration  allocated  and  reserved
with respect to the (i) Company Stock Options, (ii) Company Warrants,  and (iii)

            (B) As soon as reasonably  practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange  Agent  shall  mail to each  holder  of  record  of a  certificate  (or
certificates)   which  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  represented
outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock, as the
case may be (the  "Company  Stock  Certificates"),  (i) a letter of  transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the  Company  Stock  Certificate(s)  shall  pass,  only upon  delivery of the
Company  Stock   Certificate(s)   (or   affidavits  of  loss  in  lieu  of  such
certificates)  (the "Letter of  Transmittal") to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such  other  provisions  as Parent or the  Exchange  Agent
reasonably  may  specify,   together  with  a  substitute  Form  W-9)  and  (ii)
instructions  for use thereof in surrendering  Company Stock  Certificate(s)  in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Company Stock Certificate in proper form for cancellation,  together with a duly
executed  letter of  transmittal,  the holder of such Company Stock  Certificate
shall  be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange   therefor  a   certificate   (or
certificates)  representing  such whole number of shares of Parent  Common Stock
such  Company  shareholder  is entitled  to receive  pursuant to Section 2.1 and
Section 2.2 in such  denominations  and  registered in such names as such holder
may  request.  The  shares  represented  by the  Company  Stock  Certificate  so
surrendered  shall  forthwith  be  cancelled.  The Letter of  Transmittal  shall
provide (i)  procedures for holders whose Company Stock  Certificates  are lost,
stolen or destroyed to receive the Merger  Consideration and (ii) procedures for
the  transfer of  ownership  of shares of the Company  Common  Stock that is not
registered  on the  stock  transfer  books and  records  of the  Company.  Until
surrendered  in accordance  with this Section 2.3 and as specified in the Letter
of Transmittal, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed at all times from
and after the  Effective  Time to represent  only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

            (C)  Notwithstanding  any other  provisions  of this  Agreement,  no
dividends or other  distributions  declared or made after the Effective  Time in
respect  of  shares  of  Parent  Common  Stock  having a record  date  after the
Effective  Time shall be paid to the holder of any  unsurrendered  Company Stock
Certificate  until the holder shall surrender such Company Stock  Certificate as
provided in this Section 2.3. Subject to applicable law, following  surrender of
any such  Company  Stock  Certificate,  there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates  representing  shares of Parent  Common  Stock  issued in  exchange
therefor,  in each case  without any interest  thereon,  (i) at the time of such
surrender,  the amount of dividends  or other  distributions,  if any,  having a
record date after the  Effective  Time  theretofor  payable with respect to such
shares of Parent  Common  Stock and not paid,  less the  amount of all  required
withholding Taxes in respect thereof,  and (ii) at the appropriate  payment date
subsequent to surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions having a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to the date of such surrender and
having a payment date  subsequent to the date of such surrender and payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common  Stock,  less the amount of all required
withholding Taxes in respect thereof.

                                       13

            (D) All shares of Parent  Common  Stock  issued  upon  surrender  of
Company Stock  Certificates  in accordance with this Article II and as specified
in the  Letter of  Transmittal  shall be deemed to have been  issued and paid in
full  satisfaction  of all rights  pertaining  to such shares of Company  Common
Stock or Company  Preferred Stock  represented  thereby and, as of the Effective
Time,  the stock  transfer  books and records of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further  registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
and  records  of the  Company  of shares of  Company  Common  Stock and  Company
Preferred Stock  outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time,  Company Stock  Certificates  are properly  presented to the
Surviving  Corporation  for any reason (but  otherwise in  accordance  with this
Article  II and as  specified  in the  Letter  of  Transmittal),  they  shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.3.

            (E) At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective
Time,  Parent shall be entitled to require the  Exchange  Agent to deliver to it
any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not theretofore distributed to
former  holders of shares of Company  Common Stock and Company  Preferred  Stock
(including any interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting
from investments thereof by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and such
former  holders  shall  be  entitled  to look  only to the  Parent  (subject  to
abandoned  property,  escheat and other similar laws) with respect to the Merger
Consideration and dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock, if any,  payable upon due surrender of their Company Stock  Certificates,
in all cases  without any  interest  thereon and less all  required  withholding
Taxes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Exchange Agent
shall be  liable  to any  holder  of a  Company  Stock  Certificate  for  Merger
Consideration (or dividends or distributions in respect thereof)  delivered to a
public  official  pursuant  to any  applicable  abandoned  property,  escheat or
similar law.

      SECTION 2.4 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. If after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time and to the extent  permitted by this  Agreement,  the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock,  Company Common Stock or Company  Preferred Stock
shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares by reason of
any  reclassification,  recapitalization  or  combination,  forward stock split,
reverse stock split,  stock  dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock,
or any similar event shall occur (any such action, an "Adjustment  Event"),  the
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted correspondingly to provide to the holders
of Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock the right to receive the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement immediately prior to such
Adjustment   Event  and  Parent's   payment   obligations   likewise   shall  be
correspondingly  adjusted  such that it shall be required to pay and deliver not
more than the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties  acknowledge and agree that Parent intends to increase it's  authorized,
but unissued  securities  pursuant to Section 5.4(a),  and that change shall not
result in any adjustment pursuant to this Section.

      SECTION 2.5 SHARES OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything in
this  Agreement to the contrary,  any shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred  Stock that are outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held
by a shareholder who has properly  exercised his appraisal rights under Sections
55-13-20  through  55-13-28 of the NCBCA (the  "Dissenting  Shares) shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; provided, however,
if any such  holder  shall have  failed to  perfect  or shall  have  effectively
withdrawn or lost such shareholder's  right to dissent from the Merger under the
NCBCA and to receive  such  consideration  as may be  determined  to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of
the NCBCA,  each share of such holder's Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, thereupon shall be deemed to have been converted into and to
have  become,  as of the  Effective  Time,  the right to  receive,  without  any
interest  thereon,  the Common Stock Merger  Consideration  or Preferred  Merger
Consideration  respectively,  in accordance  with Section 2.1. The Company shall
give Parent  prompt  written  notice of (i) all demands for appraisal or payment
for shares of Company  Common Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock received by the
Company  prior to the Effective  Time in accordance  with the NCBCA and (ii) any
settlement or offer to settle any such demands.

      SECTION 2.6 STOCK OPTIONS.

            (A) At the Effective Time each outstanding option to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (a "Company  Stock Option")  granted under the Company's
1997 stock  option plan and  granted  outside  said plan shall be  automatically
amended  to   constitute   an  option  to  acquire   such  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration  as the  holder  of such  Company  Stock  Option  would  have been
entitled to receive in the Merger had such holder  exercised  such Company Stock
Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,  however, that
with respect to any Company Stock Option which is an incentive  stock option (an
"ISO") within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"),  the  determination  of the exercise  price,  number of
shares  purchasable  and terms and  conditions  of vesting shall in all respects
comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

            (B) As promptly as  practicable  after the  Effective  Time,  Parent
shall deliver to each holder of a Company Stock Option a notice that  accurately
reflects the changes to such options as  contemplated  by subsection (a) of this
Section 2.6.

            (C) The Merger Consideration  allocated to the Company Stock Options
shall be reserved  out of the Common Stock  Merger  Consideration  by Parent for
issuance  upon the exercise of all Company  Stock  Options  after the  Effective
Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if any Company Stock Option expires or is
forfeited or cancelled,  pursuant to its terms,  after the Effective  Date,  the
Parent Common Stock underlying such stock option shall no longer be reserved and
shall be  released  as  treasury  stock to Parent.  With  respect to such Parent
Common  Stock,  Parent  shall file,  no later than 180 days after the  Effective
Time,  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  a  Registration
Statement  on Form  S-8  and use its  best  efforts  to have  such  registration
statement become and remain continuously effective under the Securities Act and,
if the  Company is then  listed on a  national  stock  exchange,  file with such
exchange a listing  application  and use its best  efforts  to have such  shares
admitted to trading  thereon upon  exercises of Company  Stock  Options.  Parent
shall also use its best efforts to ensure that all ISO's  continue to qualify as
such at all times after the Effective Time.

                                       15

      SECTION 2.7 WARRANTS.

            (A) At the Effective  Time, to the extent not exercised prior to the
Effective  Time, each  outstanding  warrant to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a "Company  Warrant") set forth on Schedule 2.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule  hereof  shall be  automatically  amended  to  constitute  a warrant to
acquire  such Common Stock  Merger  Consideration  as the holder of such Company
Warrants  would have been  entitled  to  receive  in the Merger had such  holder
exercised such Company Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

            (B) As promptly as  practicable  after the  Effective  Time,  Parent
shall  deliver  to each  holder of a Company  Warrant a notice  that  accurately
reflects the Common Stock Merger  Consideration  each such holder is entitled to
receive upon the exercise of such holder's Company Warrant.

            (C) The Merger Consideration allocated to the Company Warrants shall
be reserved for issuance out of the Common Stock Merger  Consideration by Parent
for issuance upon exercise in full of all Company  Warrants  after the Effective
Time and shall  register such Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of the Company Warrants on the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon the expiration of the Company  Warrants,  such Parent Common Stock reserved
for  issuance  upon the  exercise  of the  Company  Warrants  shall no longer be
reserved and shall be released as treasury stock to Parent.

      SECTION 2.8.  CONVERTIBLE  PROMISSORY  NOTES.  At the  Effective  Time the
Convertible  Promissory  Note dated  October  19,  1999 of the  Company  and the
Convertible  Promissory Note dated April 14, 2000 of the Company  (collectively,
the "Company Convertible Promissory Notes") shall remain as debt on the books of
the Surviving  Company and Parent shall cause the Surviving  Entity to exchange,
pursuant to the terms of such Company Convertible  Promissory Notes, the Company
Convertible  Promissory  Notes for notes of the  Surviving  Entity.  The  Merger
Consideration  allocated to the Company  Convertible  Promissory  Notes shall be
reserved by Parent for issuance  out of the Common  Stock  Merger  Consideration
upon conversion of the Company Convertible  Promissory Notes after the Effective
Time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  upon the repayment and retirement of the
outstanding debt evidenced by the Company  Convertible  Promissory  Notes,  such
Parent  Common Stock  reserved for issuance  upon the  conversion of the Company
Convertible  Promissory  Notes shall no longer be reserved and shall be released
as treasury stock to Parent.

      SECTION  2.9.  TAX-FREE  REORGANIZATION.  The Merger is  intended  to be a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, and this Agreement
is  intended  to be a  "plan  of  reorganization"  within  the  meaning  of  the
regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the Code.

Stock issued upon  exercise of any Company Stock Option or Company  Warrant,  or
upon conversion of any Company Convertible  Promissory Note, after the Effective

Act,  unless such shares have been registered by Parent under the Securities Act
in a registration statement filed with, and declared effective by, the SEC after
the Effective Time.

Company's  knowledge,  threatened,  which could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company, nor are there any facts or circumstances
known to the  Company  or any of its  subsidiaries  which  could  reasonably  be
expected to give rise to any such Action.

            (C) Except as disclosed in Section 3.9(c) of the Company  Disclosure
Schedule,  there is no Action relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
by or before any Governmental Entity or otherwise pending or, to the best of the

this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated  hereby, or the benefits to the
parties hereto intended hereby and thereby.

            (D)  Prior to the  execution  of this  Agreement,  the  Company  has

required to be filed by it (giving effect to all  extensions),  except where the

United States federal income and other material Taxes required to have been paid

any of its  subsidiaries,  and neither the  Company  nor any  subsidiary  of the
Company  has  received a written  notice of any  material  pending  or  proposed
claims, audits or proceedings with respect to Taxes.

            (C) No deficiency or proposed  adjustment which has not been settled

for under the laws of the United States,  any foreign  jurisdiction or any state
or locality with respect to Taxes for any taxable year.

            (E) No election  under  Section  341(f) of the Code has been made by

            (F) No claim has been made in writing by any  Governmental  Entities

            (H) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any
notice of deficiency or assessment from any  Governmental  Entity for any amount

Company and its subsidiaries no such deficiency or assessment is proposed.

            (I) For purposes of this Agreement:

      SECTION 3.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

            (A) As used in this Agreement,  the term "Employee Plan" shall mean,
with respect to any person, all pension,  stock option, stock purchase,  phantom
stock,  bonus,  compensation,  benefit,  welfare,  profit-sharing,   retirement,
disability,  vacation,  severance,  hospitalization,  medical, surgical, dental,
optical, psychiatric,  insurance,  incentive,  deferred compensation,  death and

employees of such person or any other entity (an "ERISA  Affiliate")  related to
such person  under  Section  414(b),  (c),  (m) and (o) of the Code,  including,
without  limitation,  subsidiaries  of such person.  Section 3.11 of the Company
Disclosure  Schedule  contains a true and complete  list of all of the Company's
Employee Plans.  Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure  Schedule identifies and
includes  but is not limited to, each of the  Company's  Employee  Plans that is
subject to Section 302 or Title IV of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security
Act of 1974,  as amended  ("ERISA")  or  Section  412 of the Code.  Neither  the
Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate  of the Company  has any  commitment  or formal
plan, whether or not legally binding,  to create any additional Employee Plan or
modify or change any existing Employee Plan other than as may be required by the
express terms of such Employee Plan or applicable law.

            (B) With respect to each Employee Plan that has been qualified or is
intended  or  required to be  qualified  under the Code or that is an  "Employee
Benefit Plan" within the meaning of Section 3.3 of ERISA, such Employee Plan has
been duly approved and adopted by all necessary  and  appropriate  action of the
Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted committee thereof).

                                       27
<PAGE>

            (C) With respect to the Employee Plans,  all required  contributions
for all periods ending before the Closing Date have been or will be paid in full
by the Closing Date.  Subject only to normal  retrospective  adjustments  in the
ordinary course,  all required  insurance  premiums have been or will be paid in
full with regard to such  Employee  Plans for policy  years or other  applicable
policy  periods  ending on or before the Closing Date by the Closing Date. As of
the date hereof, none of the Employee Plans has unfunded benefit liabilities, as
defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA.

            (D) The Company has no "multi-employer plans," as defined in Section
3(37) or Section  4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414  ("Multi-Employer  Plans"),
and never has had any such plans.

            (E)  With  respect  to  each   Employee   Plan  (i)  no   prohibited
transactions as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code have
occurred or are expected to occur as a result of the Merger or the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) no action, suit, grievance,  arbitration or
other type of  litigation,  or claim with  respect to the assets of any Employee
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits made in the ordinary course of plan
administration  for which plan  administrative  review  procedures have not been
exhausted)  is  pending  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company,  threatened  or
imminent against the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any fiduciary, as such term
is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA ("Fiduciary"),  including,  but not limited
to, any action,  suit,  grievance,  arbitration or other type of litigation,  or
claim regarding conduct that allegedly  interferes with the attainment of rights
under any  Employee  Plan and (iii) the  Company has no  knowledge  of any facts
which  would  give  rise to or  could  give  rise to any  such  actions,  suits,
grievances,  arbitration or other type of litigation,  or claims with respect to
any Employee Plan. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company, nor its
directors, officers, employees or any Fiduciary has any liability for failure to
comply  with ERISA or the Code for any  action or  failure to act in  connection
with the  administration  or investment of such plan. None of the Employee Plans
is subject to any  pending  investigations  or to the  knowledge  of the Company
threatened  investigations from any Governmental Agencies who enforce applicable
laws under ERISA and the Code.

            (F)  Each of the  Employee  Plans  is,  and has  been,  operated  in
accordance  with its terms and each of the Employee  Plans,  and  administration
thereof,  is, and has been in compliance  with the  requirements  of any and all
applicable  statutes,  orders or governmental rules or regulations  currently in
effect,  including,  but not limited to,  ERISA and the Code,  except  where the
failure to comply  individually  or in the  aggregate  would not have a material
adverse  effect on the Company.  All required  reports and  descriptions  of the
Employee Plans (including but not limited to Form 5500 Annual Reports, Form 1024
Application for  Recognition of Exemption  Under Section 501(a),  Summary Annual
Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions) have been timely filed and distributed as
required by ERISA and the Code. Any notices required by ERISA or the Code or any
other state or federal law or any ruling or  regulation  of any state or federal
administrative  agency with respect to the  Employee  Plans,  including  but not
limited to any notices  required by Section 204(h),  Section 606 or Section 4043
of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, have been appropriately given.

                                       28

            (G) The Internal  Revenue Service (the "IRS") has issued a favorable
determination  letter with respect to each Employee Plan intended or required to
be  "qualified"  within the  meaning of Section  401(a) of the Code that has not
been revoked and, to the knowledge of the Company,  no circumstances  exist that
could adversely  affect the qualified  status of any such plan and the exemption
under  Section  501(a)  of the Code of the  trust  maintained  thereunder.  Each
Employee Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125,  501(c)(9) or
501(c)(17) of the Code has satisfied such requirements in all material respects.

            (H) With respect to each  Employee  Plan to which the Company or any
ERISA  Affiliate made, or was required to make,  contributions  on behalf of any
employee  during the five-year  period ending on the last day of the most recent
plan year end prior to the  Closing  Date,  (i) no  liability  under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA has been  incurred  by the  Company or any ERISA  Affiliate
that has not been  satisfied in full,  and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company,
no condition  exists that  presents a material  risk to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability and (iii) the present value of accrued
benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial  assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent  actuarial  report  prepared by such plan's  actuary
with respect to such plan did not exceed,  as of its latest  valuation date, the
then  current  value  of the  assets  of such  plan  allocable  to such  accrued
benefits. No Employee Plan or any trust established  thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section
412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recently
ended fiscal year.

            (I) No Employee Plan provides  medical,  surgical,  hospitalization,
death or similar  benefits  (whether or not insured) for  employees  for periods
extending  beyond their retirement or other  termination of service,  other than
(i)  coverage  mandated  by Section  4980B of the Code,  Section 601 of ERISA or
other  applicable  law,  (ii) death  benefits  under any  "pension  plan," (iii)
benefits the full cost of which is borne by the employee (or his beneficiary) or
(iv) Employee  Plans that can be amended or  terminated  by the Company  without
consent.  The Company  does not have any  current or  projected  liability  with
respect to  post-employment  or  post-retirement  welfare  benefits for retired,
former, or current employees of the Company.

            (J) No material  amounts  payable under the Employee Plans will fail
to be deductible  for Federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 162(m) of
the Code.

            (K) To the extent  that the  Company or any of its  subsidiaries  is
deemed to be a fiduciary with respect to any Plan that is subject to ERISA,  the
Company or such  subsidiary (i) during the past five years has complied with the
requirements  of  ERISA  and  the  Code in the  performance  of its  duties  and
responsibilities  with  respect to such  employee  benefit plan and (ii) has not
knowingly caused any of the trusts for which it serves as an investment manager,
as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA, to enter into any  transaction  that would
constitute a "prohibited transaction" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code, with respect to any such trusts,  except for transactions  that are
the subject of a statutory or administrative exemption.

            (L) No person  will be  entitled  to a "gross  up" or other  similar
payment in respect of excise  taxes under  Section 4999 of the Code with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                       29
<PAGE>

            (M) None of the  Employee  Plans have been  completely  or partially
terminated and none has been the subject of a "reportable event" as that term is
defined in Section  4043 of ERISA.  No amendment  has been  adopted  which would
require  the  Company or any ERISA  Affiliate  to provide  security  pursuant to
Section 307 of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

      SECTION 3.12 LABOR MATTERS.

            (A) With respect to  employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries:
(i) to the knowledge of the Company, no senior executive or key employee has any
plans to terminate employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries;  (ii)
there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the Company or any
of its  subsidiaries  pending or, to the  knowledge of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries,  threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or any other
comparable Governmental Entity; (iii) there is no demand for recognition made by
any labor  organization  or petition for election  filed with the National Labor
Relations Board or any other comparable Governmental Entity; (iv) there are, and
have been, no collective bargaining agreements;  and (v) there is no litigation,
arbitration  proceeding,  governmental  investigation,   administrative  charge,
citation or action of any kind  pending  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company,
proposed or threatened  against the Company or any of its subsidiaries  relating
to  employment,  employment  practices,  terms and  conditions  of employment or
wages, benefits, severance and hours.

            (B) Section  3.12(b) of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule  lists the
name,  title,  date of employment and  compensation  (whether cash or otherwise,
including  such items as options) of each  current  officer and  director of the
Company or any of its  subsidiaries,  and each current salaried  employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the  consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby will
not (i) result in any payment (including severance,  unemployment  compensation,
tax  gross-up,  bonus  or  otherwise)  becoming  due to any  current  or  former
director,  employee  or  independent  contractor  of the  Company  or any of its
subsidiaries,  from the Company or any of its  subsidiaries  under any  Employee
Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Employee Plan or otherwise,  or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment, exercise or vesting of any such benefits.

            (C) Section  3.12(c) of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule  lists all
contracts,  agreements,  plans or arrangements covering any employee, officer or
director  of the Company or its  subsidiaries  containing  "change of  control,"
"stay-put,"  transition,  retention,  severance or similar provisions,  and sets
forth the names and titles of all such  employees,  officers or  directors,  the
amounts  payable under such  provisions,  whether such  provisions  would become
payable  as a result of the  Merger and the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement, and when such amounts would be payable to such employees, officers or
directors,  all of which are in writing,  have  heretofore been duly approved by
the Company's  Board of Directors,  and true and complete copies of all of which
have heretofore been delivered to Parent. There is no contract,  agreement, plan
or arrangement (oral or written)  covering any employee,  officer or director of
the Company that individually or collectively  could give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of
the Code.

natural  resources or personal  injury  claims,  including,  but not limited to,

            (F)  There  are  no  Liens   arising   under  or   pursuant  to  any

the Company or, if curable,  is not cured  within 15 days of receipt from Parent
of written notice thereof; or

Parent or, if curable,  is not cured  within 15 days of receipt from the Company
written notice thereof.

relieve  any party from any  liability  (in  contract,  tort or  otherwise,  and
whether  pursuant  to an action at law or in equity)  for any knowing or willful
breach  by a  party  of any of its  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or in respect of fraud by any party.

time;  provided,  however,  that after  receipt  of  approval  by the  Company's

the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") as soon as  practicable on or
after the 180th day following the Effective  Time. The parties to this Agreement
acknowledge   and  agree  that  Parent  has  agreed  to  furnish   corresponding
registration   rights  to  Parent's  existing   shareholders  who  do  not  have
freely-trading  shares.  All  shares of  Parent  Common  Stock  issued as Merger
Consideration shall be subject to a lock-up period restricting  transfer of such
shares for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date (the  "Lock-Up  Period")
and each certificate  representing  such shares shall bear a restrictive  legend
reflecting  such  lock-up  arrangement  substantially  as set forth on Exhibit B
attached hereto.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the lock-up arrangement shall
end as to any shares covered by the registration statement to be filed by Parent
pursuant to this  Paragraph  simultaneously  with such shares  being sold by the
holder thereof pursuant to such  registration  statement after that registration
statement  has been  declared  effective by the SEC.  Upon  termination  of this
lock-up  arrangement  with respect to any shares,  the holder thereof may submit
the  certificate  evidencing  the same to  Parent  and  Parent  shall  cause the
restrictive legend to be removed from such certificate in respect of that number
of shares and shall instruct  Parent's transfer agent to remove such restriction
in such transfer agent's records."

issuance upon exercise in full of all Company  Warrants after the Effective Time
and shall  register  such Parent  Common Stock  reserved  for issuance  upon the
exercise of the Company Warrants on the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon the expiration of the Company  Warrants,  such Parent Common Stock reserved
for  issuance  upon the  exercise  of the  Company  Warrants  shall no longer be
reserved and shall be released as treasury stock to Parent."

      Section  2.7(c) of the  Agreement  shall be amended by  deleting  from the

securities,"  as defined in the  Securities  Act,  unless  such shares have been

Bioaccelerate,  Inc. prior to the date hereof,  Parent shall file, no later than

as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration  Statement, as
then in effect,  includes  an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omits to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements  therein  not  misleading  in the  light  of the  circumstances  then
existing,  and at the  request of any such  Holder,  prepare and furnish to such

therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading in the light

Registrable Securities (provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to
qualify  as a  foreign  corporation  to  do  business  under  the  laws  of  any
jurisdiction  in  which  it is  not  then  qualified),  and  maintain  any  such
registration  or  qualification  current  until the  earlier  of the sale of the

Registrable  Securities are to be registered  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall
furnish  the  following  to  Parent  prior  to  performance  by  Parent  of  its
obligations under this Agreement:

                  (c) written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of each
such  Holder's  agreement  to provide  customary  indemnifications  to Parent in
respect of information furnished by or on behalf of each Holder or actions taken
or omitted by each Holder (as consistent with the indemnification  provisions of
this  Agreement),  and to pay the Individual  Holder Expenses  incurred by or on
behalf of each Holder which are not Registration Expenses required to be paid by
Parent  hereunder,  and to customary  blackout  periods in the event of material
corporate developments affecting Parent or its securities; and

                  (d) written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of each
Holder's  agreement  that  upon  receipt  of any  written  notice  by  Parent to
discontinue  use of the  registration  statement  or any  prospectus  or related
document until the same are supplemented or amended, that Holder will so refrain
and,  if so directed by Parent,  will  deliver to Parent all copies,  other than
permanent file copies, then in Holder's possession of such documents at the time
of receipt of such  notice.  Furthermore,  each Holder  shall agree that if such
Holder uses a prospectus in connection  with the offering and sale of any of the
Registrable  Securities,  the Holder  will use only the  latest  version of such
prospectus provided by Parent.

      4. Expenses.  All  Registration  Expenses  incurred in connection with any
registration,  qualification or compliance  pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 of this
Agreement shall be borne by Parent.

      5. Indemnification.

            5.1  Indemnification by Parent. To the full extent permitted by law,
Parent  will  indemnify  each  Holder,  each  of  its  officers,  directors  and
employees,  and each  person  controlling  a Holder  within  the  meaning of the
Securities Act, with respect to which registration,  qualification or compliance
has been effected pursuant to this Agreement against all claims, losses, damages
and  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings or  settlements in respect  thereof)
arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of
a material fact contained in any prospectus, offering circular or other document
(including  any  related  registration  statement,  notification  or  the  like)
incident to any such registration,  qualification or compliance, or based on any
omission (or alleged  omission) to state  therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not  misleading,  or
any  violation  by  Parent  of the  Securities  Act or any  rule  or  regulation
thereunder  applicable to Parent and relating to action or inaction  required of
Parent in connection with any such  registration,  qualification  or compliance,
and will  reimburse  each  such  Holder,  each of its  officers,  directors  and
partners,  and each person  controlling  such Holder for any legal and any other
expenses  reasonably  incurred in connection with investigating and defending or
settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that Parent
will not be liable in any such case to the  extent  that any such  claim,  loss,
damage,  liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue  statement
or omission made in reliance upon and based upon written  information  furnished
to Parent by or on behalf of such Holder for use therein.

            5.2 Indemnification by the Holders.  Each Holder will, to the extent
Registrable  Securities  held  by  him or it are  included  in the  Registration
Statement,  indemnify Parent, each of its directors,  officers and employees and
each other  person,  if any,  who  controls  Parent  within  the  meaning of the
Securities Act, against all claims,  losses,  damages,  expenses and liabilities
(or actions in respect  thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement
(or  alleged  untrue  statement)  of a  material  fact  contained  in  any  such
Registration Statement,  Prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any
omission (or alleged  omission) to state  therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not  misleading,  or
any  violation by such Holder of the  Securities  Act or any rule or  regulation
thereunder applicable to such Holder and relating to action or inaction required
of such  Holder  in  connection  with any such  registration,  qualification  or
compliance,  and will  reimburse  Parent,  each of its  directors,  officers and
employees and each other person for any legal or any other  expenses  reasonably
incurred in connection  with  investigating  or defending any such claim,  loss,
damage,  liability  or action,  in each case with respect to any such alleged or
actual  untrue  statement  of a material  fact or alleged or actual  omission to
state a material  fact to the extent,  but only to the extent,  that such untrue
statement (or alleged  untrue  statement)  or omission (or alleged  omission) is
made in such  Registration  Statement,  Prospectus,  offering  circular or other
document in reliance upon and in conformity with written  information  furnished
to Parent by such Holder for use therein.

            5.3  Notices of Claims,  Procedures,  etc.  Each party  entitled  to
indemnification under this Section 5 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice
to the party  required to provide  indemnification  (the  "Indemnifying  Party")
promptly after such  Indemnified  Party has actual  knowledge of any claim as to
which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
the defense of any such claim or any litigation  resulting  therefrom,  provided
that the  Indemnified  Party may  participate in such defense at the Indemnified
Party's sole expense,  and provided  further that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its  obligations  under this Section 5 unless such failure is  prejudicial to
the   ability   of   Indemnifying   Party  to  defend   such  claim  or  action.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  such Indemnified  Party shall have the right to
employ its own counsel in any such litigation, proceeding or other action if (i)
the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Indemnifying Party, in
its sole and absolute  discretion,  or (ii) the named parties in any such claims
(including any impleaded  parties)  include any such  Indemnified  Party and the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party shall have been advised in writing
(in suitable  detail) by counsel to the Indemnified  Party either (A) that there
may be one or more legal defenses  available to such Indemnified Party which are
different from or additional to those  available to the  Indemnifying  Party, or
(B) that there is a conflict of interest by virtue of the Indemnified  Party and
the  Indemnifying  Parties having common  counsel,  in any of which events,  the
reasonable  legal fees and  expenses  of a single  counsel  for all  Indemnified
Parties  with  respect to each such claim,  defense  thereof,  or  counterclaims
thereto shall be borne by  Indemnifying  Party.  No  Indemnifying  Party, in the
defense of any such claim or litigation,  shall, except with the consent of each
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,  consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement  which does not include as an
unconditional  term  thereof  the giving by the  claimant or  plaintiff  to such
Indemnified  Party of a release  from all  liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.  Each  Indemnified  Party shall  cooperate to the extent  reasonably
required and furnish such information  regarding itself or the claim in question
as an  Indemnifying  Party may  reasonably  request in  writing  and as shall be
reasonably  required in  connection  with  defense of such claim and  litigation
resulting therefrom.

            5.4  Contribution.  If the  indemnification  provided  for  in  this
Section  5 shall  for any  reason  be held by a court to be  unenforceable  as a
matter of public policy with respect to an  Indemnified  Party in respect of any
loss,  claim,  damage,  expense or liability,  or any action in respect thereof,
then,  in lieu of the amount paid or payable  under  Section 5.1 or Section 5.2,
the Indemnified  Party and the  Indemnifying  Party under Section 5.1 or Section
5.2 shall  contribute to the aggregate  losses,  claims,  damages,  expenses and
liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with  investigating  the same),  (a) in such  proportion  as is  appropriate  to
reflect the  relative  fault of the  Indemnified  Party and  Indemnifying  Party
covered by the  registration  statement  which  resulted  in such  loss,  claim,
damage,  expense or liability,  or action or proceeding in respect thereof, with
respect to the  statements  or  omissions  which  resulted in such loss,  claim,
damage,  expense or liability,  or action or proceeding in respect  thereof,  as
well as any other  relevant  equitable  considerations  or (b) if the allocation
provided  by clause  (a)  above is not  permitted  by  applicable  law,  in such
proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative  benefits received by
the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party from the offering of the securities
covered by such  registration  statement;  provided,  that for  purposes of this
clause (b), the relative benefits  received by the prospective  sellers shall be
deemed  not to  exceed  the  amount of  proceeds  received  by such  prospective
sellers. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution  from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Such prospective
sellers'  obligations  to contribute as provided in this Section 5.4 are several
in proportion to the relative value of their respective  Registrable  Securities
covered by such  registration  statement and not joint.  In addition,  no person
shall be  obligated  to  contribute  hereunder  any  amounts in payment  for any
settlement of any action or claim effected without such person's consent,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      6. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

      7.  Exchange  Act  Compliance.  While  Parent is subject to the  reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act, Parent shall make commercially reasonable best
efforts to file the reports  required to be filed by it under the Securities Act
and the Exchange  Act and the rules and  regulations  adopted by the  Commission
thereunder,  and to take all actions  reasonably  necessary to enable Holders of
Registrable  Securities to sell such securities  without  registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the provisions of (a) Rule 144 under the
Securities  Act,  as such Rule may be amended  from time to time,  (b) Rule 144A
under the  Securities  Act,  as such Rule may be amended  from time to time,  if
applicable  or (c) any similar  rules or  regulations  hereunder  adopted by the
Commission.  Upon the request of any Holder of  Registrable  Securities,  Parent
will  deliver to such holder a written  statement  as to whether it has complied
with such requirements.

      8. Specific Performance.  The parties hereto acknowledge that there may be
no adequate  remedy at law if any party fails to perform any of its  obligations
hereunder and that each party may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and
accordingly  agree that each party,  in addition to any other remedy to which it
may be  entitled  at law or in  equity,  shall  be  entitled  to seek to  compel
specific  performance of the obligations of any other party under this Agreement
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                                      -24-

      9. No Registration  Conflict.  Parent has not previously  entered into any
agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities
to any Person that has not been fully satisfied other than  registration  rights
granted in connection with warrants issued to  Bioaccelerate,  Inc. Parent shall
not after the date hereof enter into any agreement granting  registration rights
with respect to any of its securities outstanding on the date hereof, except (i)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (ii) registration rights for Parent's existing
shareholders  who do not have  freely  tradable  shares  on the date  hereof  as

determined  by Parent's  Board of Directors  (as  constituted  subsequent to the
Merger) in the exercise of their fiduciary responsibilities.

      10.  Benefits of Agreement;  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns
of each of the  parties  and shall  inure to the benefit of each Holder and each
Holder  shall be an  intended  third  party  beneficiary  under this  Agreement.
Neither Parent nor any Holder may assign its rights or obligations hereunder.

      11.   Complete   Agreement.   This  Agreement   constitutes  the  complete
understanding  among  the  parties  with  respect  to  its  subject  matter  and
supersedes all existing agreements and understandings,  whether oral or written,
among them. No alteration or  modification  of any  provisions of this Agreement
shall be valid  unless  made in  writing  and  signed,  on the one hand,  by the
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding and, on the
other, by Parent.

      12. Section Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
for  reference  purposes  only and shall not  affect in any way the  meaning  or
interpretation of this Agreement.

      13. Notices.  All notices,  offers,  acceptances and other  communications
required or  permitted  to be given or to otherwise be made to any party to this
Agreement shall be deemed to be sufficient if contained in a written  instrument
delivered by hand,  first class mail  (registered  or certified,  return receipt
requested),  telex,  telecopier or overnight air courier  guaranteeing  next day
delivery,  if to  Parent,  at 712  Fifth  Avenue,  New York,  New  York,  10019,

Saturday,  Sunday,  or public  holiday  or a day on which  commercial  banks are
required  or  authorized  by law to close in New York,  New York.  Any party may
change the address to which each such notice or  communication  shall be sent by
giving  written  notice to tie other  parties of such new  address in the manner
provided herein for giving notice.

EXHIBIT 10.4

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT,  dated as of  December  20,  2004  (the  "Effective
Date"), between ENHANCE BIOTECH, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware ("Employer"), and Christopher Every ("Executive").

      WHEREAS,  Executive  desires to provide  services to Employer and Employer
desires to retain the services of Executive;

      WHEREAS,  Employer  and  Executive  desire  to  formalize  the  terms  and
conditions of Executive's employment with Employer.

      NOW, THEREFORE, Employer and Executive hereby agree as follows:

      1. Employment.

            1.1. General.

                  1.1.1  Effective as of the  Effective  Date,  Employer  hereby
employs  Executive  in the capacity of President  and Chief  Executive  Officer.
Executive  hereby  accepts  such  employment  upon the terms and  subject to the
conditions herein contained.  Commencing on the Effective Date,  Executive shall
have the duties set forth on  Schedule 1 attached  hereto.  Executive  agrees to
perform the foregoing duties and  responsibilities  as well as such other duties
as may be  requested  by the  Board of  Directors  of  Employer  (the  "Board of
Directors").

                  1.1.2 During Executive's  employment with Employer,  Executive
will report directly to, and take direction from, the Board of Directors.


            1.2. Board of Directors.  For so long as Executive is serving as the
President  and Chief  Executive  Officer of Employer,  Executive  agrees,  if so
requested  by  Employer,  to  serve as a member  of Board of  Directors  without
additional compensation.

            1.3. Exclusive  Full-Time  Position.  Executive,  during Executive's
employment  with  Employer,  will  devote  Executive's  best  efforts and all of
Executive's  business time,  attention and skills to the business and affairs of
Employer, it being understood that Executive shall not be employed by or provide
services  to any other  person  or entity  during  Executive's  employment  with
Employer,  provided  that  Executive  may also serve as a member of the board of
directors  or as an officer  of  Bioaccelerate,  Inc.  or its  affiliates  if so
requested by Bioaccelerate,  Inc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall
be permitted to (i) serve as a member of the board of unaffiliated companies but
only if  such  service  is with  the  prior  written  consent  of the  Board  of
Directors,  which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the Board of
Directors; (ii) serve on civic, professional or charitable boards or committees,
and (iii) manage personal investments; provided, however, that Executive may not
engage in any of the  activities  described in this  sentence to the extent such
activities (x) prevent Executive from devoting  substantially all of Executive's
business time to Employer,  (y) adversely  affect the performance of Executive's
duties and  responsibilities  to Employer or (z) violate any other  provision of
this Agreement.

                                      -27-

            1.4.  Location  of  Employment.   Executive's   principal  place  of
employment during Executive's employment with Employer shall be 20 The Crofters,
Streathem,  Ely,  Cambridgeshire CB6 3NF U.K. or such other location as Employer

Executive's  duties may require  travel and  Executive  agrees to engage in such
travel as may be required during Executive's employment.

      2. Compensation and Benefits.

            2.1. Salary. During the period of Executive's employment pursuant to
this Agreement,  Employer will pay to Executive a base salary ("Base Salary") at
an annual rate of Two Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars  ($225,000),  payable
in accordance with the customary payroll practices of Employer. Executive's Base
Salary shall be reviewed in accordance  with the policy of Employer from time to
time,  but in any  event no less than  annually,  and may be  subject  to upward
adjustment  based  upon,  among  other  factors,   Executive's  performance,  as
determined in the sole  discretion of the Board of Directors.  In no event shall
Executive's  Base  Salary in  effect at a  particular  time be  reduced  without
Executive's prior written consent.

            2.2.  Additional  Compensation.  The  compensation set forth in this
Section  is in  addition  to the Base  Salary  and other  benefits  set forth in
Section 2.

                  2.2.1 Annual Bonus.

                  (a) Executive shall be eligible for and the Board of Directors
may, in its sole discretion,  award Executive a bonus (the "Annual Bonus") based
upon the  attainment  of  performance  targets  and  other  reasonable  criteria
established  by the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Annual  Bonus  shall be paid to
Executive  at the same time it is paid to other  eligible  employees.  Except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, Executive must be employed on the date
the bonus is paid in order to earn the Annual Bonus.

                  (b) In  addition  to the  discretionary  bonus  set  forth  in
Section 2.2.1(a) above, Executive shall receive a stock bonus in an amount equal
to Thirty Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000) on each of the first, second and third
anniversaries of the Effective Date which shares shall be registered pursuant to
a  Registration  Statement on Form S-8 which shall be filed with the  Securities
Exchange Commission.

<PAGE>

                  2.2.2  Stock   Options.   As  additional   consideration   for
Executive's performance of services hereunder, upon the Effective Date, Employer
shall issue to Executive,  pursuant to Employer's 2004 Incentive  Plan,  options
(the  "Options")  to purchase 1.4 Million  shares of  Employer's  common  stock,
$0.001 par value per share.  It is  intended  that the  maximum  amount of these
Options as permitted  under law qualify as an  "incentive  stock  option"  under
Section  422 of the  Code,  and to the  extent  that all or any  portion  of the
Options  do not so  qualify,  the  Options  shall be  treated  as  non-qualified
options.  The Options  shall have a per share  exercise  price equal to not less
than the fair market value on the date of grant and shall expire on a date to be
established by the Board of Directors or the applicable committee  administering
the Employer's 2004 Incentive  Plan, but no later than the tenth  anniversary of
the Effective Date. The Options are subject to the following  vesting  schedule;
provided,  however,  that  Executive  must be an  employee  of  Employer  on the
applicable  vesting date in order for such  Options to vest:  25% of the Options
shall vest on the date of grant and 25% of the Options shall vest on each of the
first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.

            2.3.  Executive  Benefits.  In  addition  to  the  Base  Salary  and
additional compensation set forth in Section 2, Executive shall also be entitled
to the following benefits during Executive's employment hereunder:

                  2.3.1. Expenses. Employer shall, subject to Employer's expense
reimbursement  policies as  established  or amended from time to time,  promptly
reimburse Executive for expenses Executive  reasonably incurs in connection with
the  performance  of  Executive's   duties   (including,   without   limitation,
reimbursement  for  professional  society  membership  fees and  fees to  attend
meetings  of such  professional  societies,  business  travel and  entertainment
expenses);  provided, that Executive has provided Employer with documentation of
such expenses in accordance with Employer's expense  reimbursement  policies and
applicable tax requirements.

                  2.3.2.   Employer   Plans.   Executive  will  be  entitled  to
participate  in the employee  benefit plans and programs  generally  provided to
employees  by  Employer  from  time to  time,  including,  but not  limited  to,
participation in any 401(k),  life insurance,  health and accident,  medical and
dental, disability and retirement plans and programs,  subject to and on a basis
consistent with the terms,  conditions and overall  administration of such plans
and  programs.  Employer  retains  the  unilateral  right to  amend,  modify  or
terminate any of its employee benefit plans and programs at any time.

                  2.3.3.  Vacation.  Executive  shall be entitled to twenty (20)
working  days of paid  vacation  leave per year.  Vacation  must be scheduled at
those times most convenient to Employer's  business as reasonably  determined by
the Board of Directors.

                  2.3.4.  Coverage.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  prevent
Executive from participating in any other compensation plan or benefit plan made
available to Executive by Employer.

                  2.3.5.   Life/Key  Man  Insurance.   Providing   Executive  is
insurable at  commercially  reasonable  rates,  Employer  shall obtain term life
insurance  on the life of  Executive  in the  amount  of at least  $500,000,  at
Employer's  expense,  and  Executive  may name the  beneficiary  of the  policy.
Employer shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,  to obtain key man life
insurance on the life of employee at Employer's  expense, in reasonable amounts,
but not less than the amounts set forth in the preceding sentence.

            2.4. Taxes and Withholding.  Employer shall have the right to deduct
and withhold from all  compensation  payable to Executive  all Medicare,  social
security,  and other federal,  state and local taxes and charges which currently
are or hereafter may be required by law to be so deducted or withheld.

            2.5. Employment Term. Executive's employment by Employer pursuant to
this Agreement  shall commence as of the Effective Date and,  except as provided
in Section 3.1 hereof,  will continue at-will until the third anniversary of the
Effective  Date. On the third  anniversary  of the Effective Date this Agreement
shall  terminate  and,  unless  Executive  and  the  Employer  enter  into a new
employment agreement,  Executive shall thereafter be an employee at-will subject
to the general employment policies and practices of the Employer.

      3. Termination of Employment.

            3.1.  Events of  Termination.  Executive's  employment with Employer
will terminate upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events:

                  3.1.1.  Death. In the event of Executive's death,  Executive's
employment will terminate on the date of death.

                  3.1.2. Disability.  In the event of Executive's Disability (as
hereinafter  defined),  Employer  will have the option to terminate  Executive's
employment by giving a written  notice of such  termination  to  Executive.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means Executive's inability as a result
of a  physical  or  mental  illness  to  perform  Executive's  duties  which has
continued or is expected to continue for an aggregate of 90 days (not  including
permitted  vacation days and holidays) during any consecutive 365 day period, as
determined  in good  faith by the  Board of  Directors  upon  the  advice  of an
independent physician.

                  3.1.3. Termination by Employer for Cause.

      Employer may, at it's option, terminate Executive's employment for "Cause"
upon giving  written notice of such  termination  to Executive.  As used in this
Agreement,  the term "Cause" shall include but not necessarily be limited to (i)
conviction  of, or plea of nolo  contendere  to, a felony  or a crime  involving
moral  turpitude;  (ii)  engagement  in conduct which has the effect of bringing
disrepute to the Employer's  reputation or hold the Employer or the Executive up
to public ridicule;  (iii) fraud on or misappropriation of any funds or property
of the Employer,  any affiliate,  customer or vendor;  (iv) willful violation of
any law,  rule or  regulation  (other than minor  traffic  violations or similar
offenses); (v) personal dishonesty,  willful misconduct,  or breach of fiduciary
duty which involves personal profit;  (vi) gross incompetence in the performance
of the  Executive's  duties under this  Agreement;  (vii) willful  misconduct in


                                       4
<PAGE>

connection  with the  Executive's  duties or  willful  failure  to  perform  the
Executive's  responsibilities  in the  best  interests  of the  Employer;  (vii)
habitual  absenteeism or inattention to the Executive's duties; (ix) chronic use
of alcohol,  drugs or other similar  substances  (other than pursuant to medical
prescriptions  and  under  doctors'  supervision  for  treatment  of  legitimate
illnesses or conditions)  which affects the Executive's  work  performance;  (x)
violation of any Employer  rule,  regulation,  procedure or policy which has, or
may  reasonably be expected to have, a material  adverse effect on the Employer;
(xi)  engaging in behavior  that would  constitute  grounds  for  liability  for
harassment (as proscribed by the U.S. Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission
Guidelines  or any other  applicable  state or local  regulatory  body) or other
egregious conduct that violates laws governing the workplace;  or (xii) material
breach  of  any   material   provision   of  any   employment,   non-disclosure,
non-competition,  non-solicitation  or other similar  agreement  executed by the
Executive for the benefit of the Employer (including,  without limitation,  such
provisions  within this Agreement) or of any material  Employer  policy,  all as
determined by the Board of Directors,  which  determination  will be conclusive.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary,  employment may not be terminated for
Cause in the event that the Executive becomes permanently  disabled as set forth
in this Agreement or dies. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,  the
Employer  shall give the  Executive  written  notice  prior to  terminating  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause under any  circumstance  in which the conduct
constituting  Cause  is  reasonably  open  to  cure  (for  instance,  by  way of
illustration  only,  where the Cause does not  involve a  violation  of trust or
otherwise  adversely  affect the  relationship  between  the  Executive  and the
Employer on a  going-forward  basis or involve  commission  of an act, such as a
felony, or an unauthorized  disclosure of confidential material, or an act which
may constitute  illegal  harassment  under laws  governing the workplace,  which
can't be undone),  setting forth in reasonable  detail the nature of any alleged
breach and the conduct required to cure such breach. If, and only if, the nature
of the  breach is such  that the  breach is  reasonably  open to cure,  then the
Executive  shall have  fourteen  (14) days from the giving of such notice within
which to cure such breach.

                  3.1.4. Without Cause By Employer. Employer may, at its option,
terminate  Executive's  employment for any reason whatsoever (other than for the
other reasons set forth above in this Section 3.1) by giving  written  notice of
such termination to Executive, and Executive's employment shall terminate on the
later of the date the written  notice of such  termination  is given or the date
set forth in such written notice.

                  3.1.5.  For  Good  Reason  by  Executive.  Executive  may,  at
Executive's option, terminate Executive's employment for "Good Reason" by giving
written  notice of  termination to Employer in the event that there is a failure
of Employer  (or  successor  employer)  to promptly  pay  Executive's  salary or
additional  compensation or benefits hereunder in accordance with this Agreement
in any material respect. It shall also be considered Good Reason for termination
by  Executive  if, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined  below),  any
successor  employer  fails to fully  assume  Employer's  obligations  under this
Agreement.  For purposes, of this Agreement,  a "Change of Control",  shall mean
(i) the dissolution or liquidation of Employer,  or (ii) the consummation of any
merger  or  consolidation  of  Employer  other  than in a  transaction  in which
Employer is the surviving corporation or a majority of the board of directors of
the surviving  corporation were directors of Employer before such transaction or
are designated by the former shareholders of Employer,  or (iii) a sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the then-outstanding capital stock of
Employer  or a  sale  or  other  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all of
Employer's assets. Good Reason shall also include any requirement that Executive
move his principal  office to a location  outside the Research  Triangle area of
North Carolina.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  3.1.6.  Without  Good  Reason  By  Executive.   Executive  may
terminate Executive's  employment for any reason (other than for Good Reason) by
giving written notice of such  termination to Employer.  Executive's  employment
shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date, following the date of the notice
of  termination,  upon which a suitable  replacement  for  Executive is found by
Employer or upon which Employer makes a  determination,  in its sole discretion,
that Executive's  duties shall be undertaken by other employees of Employer,  or
(ii)  sixty  (60) days after the date of  receipt  by  Employer  of the  written
notice.

            3.2.  Certain  Obligations  of  Employer  Following  Termination  of
Executive's  Employment.  Following the  termination of  Executive's  employment
under the  circumstances  described  below,  Employer  will pay to  Executive in
accordance with its regular  payroll  practices the following  compensation  and
provide the following benefits:

                  3.2.1.  Death;  Disability.  In  the  event  that  Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of Executive's death or Disability, Executive
or Executive's estate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the following:

                  (i) that portion of any unpaid Base Salary up to and including
the date of such  termination  and any  accrued  but unused  vacation  up to and
including the date of such termination (the "Accrued Amount");

                  (ii) any accrued but unpaid Annual Bonus for any year prior to
the year in which such termination occurred ("Prior Annual Bonuses");

                  (iii) any unreimbursed business expenses incurred prior to the
date of such termination ("Expense Reimbursement");

                  (iv) all  benefits  generally  available  under  the  employee
benefit  plans,  and the policies  and  practices  of  Employer,  determined  in
accordance with the applicable terms and provisions of such plans,  policies and
practices,  in each  case,  as  accrued  to the  date of  termination  ("Accrued
Benefits")  or  otherwise  payable  as a  consequence  of  Executive's  death or
Disability; and

                  (v) the right to exercise all options that are fully vested as
of the date of such termination for the remainder of the term of such options as
fully set forth in the applicable grant agreement.

                  3.2.2.   Without  Cause  by  Employer;   For  Good  Reason  by
Executive.  In the event that  Executive's  employment is terminated by Employer
pursuant to Section  3.1.4  hereof or by  Executive  pursuant  to Section  3.1.5
hereof, Executive shall be entitled to the following:

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (i)  continuing  payments of then  current Base Salary for the
following period (each such period as applicable, the "Severance Period"):

                        (a) if  such  termination  occurs  prior  to  the  first
                        anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  for  the  period
                        beginning on the date of such  termination and ending on
                        the second anniversary of the Effective Date, or

                        (b) if such  termination  occurs  on or after  the first
                        anniversary  of the Effective  Date, for the twelve (12)
                        month period following such termination;

and

                  (ii) continuing  coverage under  Employer's  employee  benefit
plans  during the  Severance  Period or if earlier,  until  Executive is covered
under the employee benefit plans of another employer;

                  (iii)  the  Accrued  Amount,  Prior  Annual  Bonuses,  Expense
Reimbursement and Accrued Benefits; and

                  (iv) any unvested portion of any options previously granted to
Executive  that is  scheduled  to vest during the  Severance  Period  shall vest
immediately  as of the date of such  termination  and  Executive  shall have the
right to  exercise  all  options  that are  fully  vested as of the date of such
termination  (including,  those  vested  by  acceleration  on the  date  of such
termination) for the remainder of the term of such options as fully set forth in
the applicable grant agreement.

                  3.2.3.  Termination  by  Executive  Without  Good Reason or by
Employer  for  Cause.  In the event  Executive's  employment  is  terminated  by
Executive  pursuant  to Section  3.1.6 or Section  3.1.7  hereof or by  Employer
pursuant to Section  3.1.3  hereof,  Executive  shall be entitled to the Accrued
Amount, Expense Reimbursement and Accrued Benefits.

                  3.2.4.  Termination on the Third  Anniversary of the Effective
Date. In the event  Executive's  employment is terminated upon the expiration of
this Agreement on the third  anniversary of the Effective Date,  Executive shall
not be entitled to any  compensation,  benefits or severance of any kind, except
as required by law.

            3.3.  Nature of  Payments.  All  amounts to be paid by  Employer  to
Executive  pursuant  to this  Section  3 are  considered  by the  parties  to be
severance  payments.  In the event such  payments are treated as damages,  it is
expressly  acknowledged by the parties that damages to Executive for termination
of  employment  would be  difficult  to  ascertain  and the  above  amounts  are
reasonable estimates thereof.

            3.4. Release.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither the
Executive nor the Executive's  estate  shall be entitled to receive any
compensation, reimbursement

                                       7
<PAGE>

or  benefits  upon  termination  of  employment  (other than as required by law)
unless the Executive or the Executive's estate, as the case may be, executes and
delivers to the Employer promptly after  termination a written release,  in form
and substance  reasonably  satisfactory to the Employer,  by which the Executive
and the Executive's  estate,  as the case may be, releases the Employer from any
obligations  and  liabilities  of any type  whatsoever  related  to  Executive's
employment  under this  Agreement,  except for the Employer's  obligations  with
respect to Section 3.2 of this  Agreement,  which  release  shall not affect the
Executive's  estate's  right,  if any, to  indemnification  with  respect to, or
insurance in respect of, any actions  taken within the scope of the  Executive's
employment,  or the Executive's or the Executive's estate's rights in respect of
the  Executive's  vested  securities.  The parties hereto  acknowledge  that the
compensation, reimbursement and benefits to be provided under Section 3.2 are to
be provided in consideration  for the  above-specified  release,  as well as for
Executive's  agreement to be bound by the  provisions of Section 3.5 and Section
4.

            3.5. Other Provisions Applicable to Termination of Employment.

                  (1) At any time after notice to terminate  this  Agreement has
            been served or received by the Employer, the Employer, without being
            deemed in breach of this Agreement or being deemed to be taken steps
            which would  constitute  grounds for a different kind of termination
            under this Agreement,  may require the Executive to do the following
            during the applicable notice period concluding on the effective date
            of termination of employment under this Agreement:

                        (i) work in a capacity  consistent  with the Executive's
                  then  applicable  position and status other than that in which
                  the  Executive is employed  under this  Agreement  but without
                  affecting the Executive's  fixed salary,  including  benefits;
                  and

                        (ii) remain away from work and,  although the  Executive
                  will continue to receive the  Executive's  salary and benefits
                  provided for under this Agreement during such period,  and the
                  Employer will not be obliged to provide the Executive with any
                  work  although the Employer  may, in its absolute  discretion,
                  assign to the Executive during this period, from time to time,
                  such  appropriate  tasks or  projects as may be carried out by
                  the Executive away from the Employer's offices.

                  (2) Upon termination of the Executive's  employment under this
            Agreement, the Executive shall do the following:

                        (i)  forthwith  surrender  to  the  Employer,   in  good
                  condition and working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted),
                  all Employer property in the Executive's possession including,
                  without limitation,  all books, papers and other documents (of
                  whatever  nature  and  in  whatever  media)  belonging  to the
                  Employer or its  subsidiary or associated  company or relating
                  to  the  business  of  the  Employer  or  its   subsidiary  or
                  associated companies;

                                       8
<PAGE>

                        (ii) if the  Executive  is a director of the Employer or
                  of any subsidiary or associated  company,  or if the Executive
                  is an officer of any subsidiary or any associated company, and
                  is so  requested  by the  Employer,  resign as an  officer  or
                  director, as the case may be, within forty-eight (48) hours of
                  being so requested  and,  should the  Executive  fail to do so
                  within  forty-eight  (48)  hours of being  so  requested,  the
                  Executive  irrevocably  authorizes  the Employer to appoint an
                  agent in the Executive's name and on the Executive's behalf to
                  execute  and  deliver  any  documents  and to take any and all
                  actions  reasonably  deemed by the Employer to be necessary or
                  appropriate  to  give  effect  to such  resignation(s)  by the
                  Executive; and

                        (iii)  immediately  repay all outstanding debts or loans
                  due  to the  Employer  and/or  any  subsidiary  or  associated
                  company, the Employer being expressly authorized, for purposes
                  of clarity, to deduct the same from any wages of the Executive
                  a sum in  repayment  of all or any part of any  such  debts or
                  loans.

      4. Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation; Non-Compete.

            4.1.  Confidential  and Proprietary  Information;  Non-Solicitation.
Executive's  employment  by  Employer  is subject  to  Executive  executing  the
Proprietary Rights and  Confidentiality  Agreement annexed hereto as Schedule 2.
Such agreement shall be deemed, upon execution, to be incorporated in and a part
of this Agreement.

            4.2.  Executive  acknowledges  and agrees that (a) Employer  will be
irreparably  injured in the event of a breach by Executive of any of Executive's
obligations  under  Section 4.1;  (b)  monetary  damages will not be an adequate
remedy for any such breach; (c) in the event of any such breach Employer will be
entitled to injunctive relief as a matter of right and without posting a bond or
other security, in addition to any other remedy which it may have, and Executive
shall not oppose such injunctive relief based upon the extent of the harm or the
adequacy of monetary damages.

            4.3. Non-competition and Non-solicitation.

            (a) The Executive agrees and  acknowledges  that, in connection with
the  Executive's  employment  with the Employer,  the Executive will be provided
with access to and become familiar with confidential and proprietary information
and trade secrets belonging to the Employer.  Executive further acknowledges and
agrees  that,  given the nature of this  information  and trade  secrets,  it is
likely that such  information  and trade  secrets  would  inevitably  be used or
revealed,  either  directly or indirectly,  in any subsequent  employment with a
competitor  of the  Employer in any  position  comparable  to the  position  the
Executive  holds  with  the  Employer  under  this  Agreement.  Accordingly,  in
consideration of the Executive's  employment with the Employer  pursuant to this
Agreement,  and other good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, Executive agrees that, while the Executive is in the employ
of the Employer and for a period equal to the greater of the period during which
the Executive  receives any severance  pursuant to this  Agreement,  if any, and
Twelve (12) months after the  termination  of the  Executive's  employment,  the
Executive  shall not,  either on the  Executive's own behalf or on behalf of any
third  party,  except on  behalf  of the  Employer  or,  with the prior  written
agreement of the Employer (not to be unreasonably  withheld) or any affiliate of
the Employer, directly or indirectly:

                                       9
<PAGE>

                  (1) Other than through the  Executive's  ownership of stock of
the Employer,  directly or indirectly,  own,  manage,  operate,  join,  control,
finance or participate  in the ownership,  management,  operation,  control,  or
financing of, or be connected as a proprietor,  partner,  stockholder,  officer,
director,  principal, agent,  representative,  joint venturer, investor, lender,
consultant or otherwise with, or use or permit the  Executive's  name to be used
in connection with, any business or enterprise engaged directly or indirectly in
competition with the Business Conducted by the Employer (as hereinafter defined)
at any time  during  such  period,  and any other  business  ("Other  Business")
engaged in by the Employer that Executive is or has been directly  involved with
during the Twelve (12) month period  immediately  preceding  termination  of the
Executive's employment.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Business Conducted
by the Employer" shall mean the discovery, clinical or pre-clinical development,
sale  and/or  manufacture  of drugs  or drug  candidates  that  are  known to be
pharmacologically  active  at the  delta  and/or  mu cell  receptor(s),  and the
acquisition, licensing, development,  manufacturing,  marketing and distribution
of drugs and treatments for such other  conditions as the Employer is engaged in
addressing during the Twelve (12) month period immediately preceding termination
of the  Executive's  employment.  The  foregoing,  however,  shall  not  prevent
Executive from performing  services for a business engaged in the  biotechnology
or  biopharmaceutical  businesses  generally which is not  competitive  with the
Employer,  or for a competitive  business if such  competitive  business is also
engaged in lines of  business  which do not  compete  with the  Employer  and if
Executive's  services  are  restricted  to  employment  in such  other  lines of
business.  It is  recognized by the Executive and the Employer that the Business
Conducted  by the  Employer  is and is  expected  to  continue  to be  conducted
throughout  the United States and the world,  and that more narrow  geographical
limitations   of  any  nature  on  this   non-competition   covenant   (and  the
non-solicitation  provisions  set  forth  in  clauses  (2)  and (3)  below)  are
therefore not appropriate.  The foregoing  restriction shall not be construed to
prohibit the ownership by Executive as a passive investment of not more than one
percent  (1%) percent of any class of  securities  of any  corporation  which is
engaged  in any  of the  foregoing  businesses  having  a  class  of  securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                  (2) Attempt in any manner to solicit from a current  client or
customer of the Employer at the time of the Executive's termination, business of
the type  performed by the Employer or to persuade any client of the Employer to
cease to do  business  or change  the  nature of the  business  or to reduce the
amount of  business  which any such  client  has  customarily  done or  actively
contemplates doing with the Employer; or

                  (3)  Recruit,  solicit  or induce,  or attempt to induce,  any
person  or  entity  which,  at the time of the  termination  of the  Executive's
employment  or at any time  during the Twelve  (12) month  period  prior to such
termination was an employee of the Employer or its affiliates, to terminate such
employee's employment with, or otherwise cease such employee's relationship with
the Employer or its affiliates.  As used in this Agreement,  an affiliate of the
Employer is any person or entity that,  directly or  indirectly,  through one or
more intermediaries,  controls,  or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the Employer.

                                       10
<PAGE>

            (b) The parties  agree that the relevant  public  policy  aspects of
covenants  not to compete  have been  discussed,  and that every effort has been
made to limit the  restrictions  placed  upon the  Executive  to those  that are
reasonable  and  necessary  to  protect  the  Employer's  legitimate  interests.
Executive acknowledges that, based upon the Executive's  education,  experience,
and training,  this  non-compete  provision  will not prevent the Executive from
earning a livelihood and supporting  himself and the  Executive's  family during
the relevant time period.

            (c) If any  restriction  set  forth in  Section  4.3 is found by any
court of competent  jurisdiction to be unenforceable  because it extends for too
long a period  of time or over too  great a range of  activities  or  geographic
area, it shall be interpreted  to extend over the maximum period of time,  range
of activities or geographic areas as to which it may be enforceable.

            (d)  The  restrictions  contained  in  4.3  are  necessary  for  the
protection  of the business and goodwill of the Employer  and/or its  affiliates
and are  considered  by the Executive to be reasonable  for such  purposes.  The
Executive agrees that any material breach of Section 4.3 will cause the Employer
and/or its affiliates  substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore,  in the
event of any such  breach,  in  addition  to such  other  remedies  which may be
available,  the Employer shall have the right to seek specific  performance  and
injunctive relief.

            (e) The  provisions  of Section  4.3 shall  survive  termination  or
expiration of this Agreement.

            (f) EXECUTIVE HAS READ AND  CAREFULLY  CONSIDERED  THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT,  HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT  EXECUTIVE'S OWN LEGAL COUNSEL TO
ADVISE EXECUTIVE REGARDING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EXECUTIVE NOW AGREES
THAT THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT  ARE FAIR AND  REASONABLE  AND ARE  REASONABLY
REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYER.  EXECUTIVE  FURTHER
AGREES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE
ABILITY OF EXECUTIVE TO SECURE  EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE
LIVING.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be enforceable  notwithstanding
the existence of any claim or cause of action of Executive  against the Employer
whether  predicated on this  Agreement or otherwise.  Failure of the Employer to
enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the conditions or covenants
of this  Agreement  shall not be construed as a waiver of such  provisions or of
the right of the  Employer to enforce  subsequent  breaches of the same or other
conditions and covenants,  unless such permanent waiver is provided to Executive
in writing and signed by the  President  of the Employer or, if Executive is the
President  of the  Employer,  such writing is to be signed by the officer of the
Employer designated for such purpose by the Board of Directors.

            (g)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein which may be construed to the
contrary,  Executive shall be free to use and employ Executive's general skills,
know-how and expertise,  and to use, disclose and employ any generalized  ideas,
concepts,  know-how,  methods, techniques or skills gained or learned during the
course of providing the services  hereunder,  so long as Executive  acquires and
applies this  information  without  violating the terms of this Paragraph 4.3 or
the Proprietary Rights and  Confidentiality  Agreement executed and delivered by
the Executive to the Employer in connection herewith.

                                       11

            (h) The term of this non-competition covenant shall be tolled during
any period of actual  competition or breach of this Section 4.3 by the Executive
and/or any period of litigation to enforce  Executive's  obligations  under this
Agreement.

      5. Indemnification. Executive shall be covered by the Employer's directors
and officers liability insurance policy, and errors and omissions  coverage,  to
the same  extent  such  coverage is  generally  provided by the  Employer to its
directors  and officers and to the fullest  extent  permitted by such  insurance
policies. In addition,  the Employer shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless
from all liability to the fullest extent permitted by the Employer's  bylaws and
applicable law.

      6. Miscellaneous Provisions.

            6.1.  Severability.  If in any  jurisdiction  any term or  provision
hereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) the remaining terms and
provisions   hereof   shall  be   unimpaired,   (b)  any  such   invalidity   or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other  jurisdiction,  and (c) the invalid or
unenforceable  term or provision  shall, for purposes of such  jurisdiction,  be

THIS AGREEMENT is made this ___ day of December,  2004, between Enhance Biotech,
Inc., a Delaware corporation,  with its offices at712 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY
10019 (the "Company"),  and Christopher Every, an individual  residing at 20 The
Crofters,  Stretham,  Ely,  Cambridgeshire CB6 3NF, United Kingdom ("Employee").
This Agreement is based on the following understandings:

      A.  Employee  is a valued  employee  and officer of the Company and has an
      interest  as an  employee  and  officer  in the  continued  success of the
      Company; and

      B. The Company and Employee wish to set forth certain agreements regarding
      the terms of Employee's employment; and

      C.  Employee  is  entering  into an  agreement  simultaneously  with  this
      Agreement concerning his duties and compensation as an officer of Company.

      THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the employment of Employee by
the Company,  the  disclosure  by the Company of  confidential  and trade secret
information,  and the mutual  promises  and  agreements  in this  document,  the
parties to this Agreement contract as follows:

      1. Confidential  Information.  Employee may gain access to or knowledge of
information  about Company  and/or  Company  clients and  customers  that is not
generally  known  or  available  to  the  public  ("Confidential  Information").
Confidential  Information  may include,  but is not limited to:  Inventions  (as
defined  below),  research  results,  specifications,  models,  diagrams,  data,
flowcharts,  spreadsheets,  marketing and development  plans,  chemical compound
structures,  synthesis  methods,  pre-clinical  and  clinical  data,  regulatory
filings,  content of  negotiations  with potential  licensees  and/or  partners,
financial investors or affiliates, client names and other information related to
current and potential clients (including  without  limitation names,  addresses,
phone  and  fax  numbers,   and  services  requested  and  provided  and  client
information   acquired  in  the  course  of  providing   services  to  clients),
prospective  client  lists,  price  lists,  pricing  policies,  supplier  lists,
financial  information  and  employee  files.  It shall  also  include,  without
limitation, data, notes, records, files, memoranda,  reports, designs, drawings,
plans,  sketches,  documents,  print-outs,  and the  like,  in any way or in any
medium  incorporating  or reflecting  any of the  Confidential  Information,  or
relating to the Company's Business (as defined below) or to any client,  vendor,
licensor,  licensee or other party transacting business with the Company and any
information which Employee made or makes,  conceived or conceives,  developed or
develops or obtained or obtains  knowledge  or access  through or as a result of
Employee's  relationship  with  the  Company  (including  information  received,
originated,  discovered  or developed in whole or in part by Employee)  from the
initial  date  of  Employee's  employment  with  the  Company.  As  used in this
Agreement,  the term "Company's Business" shall mean the discovery,  clinical or
pre-clinical  development,  sale and/or  manufacture of drugs or drug candidates
that are  known to be  pharmacologically  active  at the  delta  and/or  mu cell
receptor(s),  and  the  acquisition,   licensing,  development,   manufacturing,
marketing and  distribution of drugs and treatments for such other conditions as
the Company is engaged in  addressing  during the  Employee's  employment by the
Company.  Confidential Information also includes any information described above
which the Company  obtains  from another  party and which the Company  treats as
proprietary or designates as Confidential  Information,  whether or not owned or
developed  by the  Company,  including  without  limitation,  information  of or
concerning  the Company's  clients,  partners,  financial  investors or business
collaborators.  The  failure of the  Company to mark any of the  above-described
information as proprietary,  confidential, or secret shall not affect its status
as part of the Confidential Information protected by this Agreement.

                                       1
<PAGE>

            For the purposes of this Agreement,  "Inventions"  shall mean ideas,
designs, creations, concepts, techniques, inventions, improvements, discoveries,
and works of  authorship,  whether or not patentable or protectable by copyright
or patent,  whether or not fixed in a tangible  medium of expression and whether
or not reduced to practice,  including but not limited to the nature and results
of research and development activities,  processes,  formulae, devices, designs,
processes,  computer  programs,  and  methods,  together  with any  improvements
thereon or thereto,  derivative  works or applications  derived  therefrom,  and
know-how related thereto.

            Information  publicly known that is generally  employed by the trade
at or after the time Employee first learns of such information  (other than as a
result of a breach by  Employee  of any duty owed to,  or  agreement  with,  the
Company),  or generic information or knowledge which Employee would have learned
in the course of similar  employment or work elsewhere in the trade shall not be
deemed part of the Confidential Information.

      2.  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information.  Employee  agrees  that
Employee  has a fiduciary  duty to the Company and that  Employee  shall hold in
confidence  and  shall  not,  except  in the  course  of  performing  Employee's
employment obligations or pursuant to written authorization from the Company, at
any  time  during  or  for  ten  (10)  years  after  termination  of  Employee's
relationship  with the  Company  (a)  directly  or  indirectly  reveal,  report,
publish,  disclose or transfer the Confidential  Information or any part thereof
to any person or entity;  (b) directly or  indirectly  use, or permit the use of
any of the  Confidential  Information  or any part thereof for any purpose other
than for the benefit of the Company;  (c) assist any person or entity other than
the Company to secure any benefit from the Confidential  Information or any part
thereof or (d) solicit (on  Employee's  behalf or on behalf of any third  party)
any  employee of the Company for the purpose of  providing  services or products
which Employee is prohibited from providing hereunder.

      3.  Ownership of  Confidential  Information  and Work  Product.  Except as
limited by this Paragraph, Employee agrees that all Confidential Information and
all other work  product of any type or nature  created by Employee or  resulting
from  work  performed  by  Employee  for the  Company,  or using  the  Company's
facilities,  equipment,  supplies or other property, or related to the Company's
Business,  even if not Confidential  Information (such Confidential  Information
and work product being defined as "Work  Product"),  shall belong to the Company
exclusively and without any additional compensation to Employee. Employee agrees
that any original  copyrightable Work Product shall be considered as "works made
for hire," and that the  Company  shall be deemed the author  thereof,  provided
that to the extent such Work Product is determined not to constitute "works made
for hire" as a matter of law, Employee hereby irrevocably  assigns and transfers
to the Company all rights in and to such Work Product.

                                       2
<PAGE>

            The  Company's  ownership  right to such Work  Product  shall extend
regardless  of the hours during which or facilities at which the Work Product is
made or the  resources or ownership  of  resources  used in making it;  provided
however that the  assignment  of rights  shall not apply to creations  developed
entirely  on  Employee's  own  time  without  using  the  Company's  facilities,
equipment, supplies or other property, Confidential Information or Work Product,
provided  that the  creations  do not (a) relate to the  Company's  Business  or
actual or demonstrably  anticipated research or development,  or (b) result from
any work performed by Employee for the Company.

            Upon request  Employee will execute any instrument  required to vest
in the Company  complete  title and ownership to all Work Product,  and will, at
the request and expense of the  Company,  execute any  instruments  necessary to
obtain legal protection in the United States and foreign  countries for all Work
Product  and for the purpose of vesting  title  thereto in the  Company,  or its
nominee, all without any additional  compensation of any kind to Employee.  Only
if the Company  executes a written  statement  that it does not desire to obtain
protection for a particular Invention or copyrightable creation is Employee free
to obtain  protection  in  Employee's  own name and at  Employee's  own expense;
provided,  however,  that the  Company  shall have a  royalty-free  nonexclusive
irrevocable license under any patent or copyright so obtained by Employee.

      4.  Disclosure to the Company.  Upon the conception of any Work Product by
Employee  (either solely or in conjunction  with others) and without  waiting to
perfect or  complete  it,  Employee  promises  and agrees  immediately  to fully
disclose  to the  President  and Chief  Executive  Officer  or other  applicable
officer of the Company designated by the Board of Directors of the Company,  and
to no one else,  and  thereafter  to treat the Work  Product as the property and
secret of the  Company.  This shall  include  Work  Product  made,  conceived or
reduced to practice after the term of Employee's  employment but which belong to
the Company  pursuant to  Paragraphs 3 and 9. Upon request  Employee will reduce
any concept in the Work Product to writing and deliver all copies of the writing
to the President of the Company, or if Employee is the President of the Company,
such copies shall be  delivered  to such other  officer of the Company as may be
designated  by the Board of Directors of the Company.  These  obligations  shall
continue  beyond the  termination  of  employment  with  respect to Work Product
conceived or made during the period of employment.

      5.  Collaboration.  Employee  warrants  that  Employee  will  disclose the
participation  of any other  person in any of  Employee's  work for the Company.
Absent such  disclosure,  Employee  warrants that all work performed by Employee
will be Employee's own and that no other person shall have any right,  title, or
interest in any work submitted to the Company.

                                       3
<PAGE>

      6. Records.  Employee agrees that Employee will keep and maintain adequate
and current written records of all Work Product created by Employee. All written
records  relating  to any Work  Product,  whether  in the form of  notes,  data,
reference materials, sketches, drawings, memoranda, correspondence,  blueprints,
manuals, letters, notebooks,  reports, flowcharts,  programs,  proposals, or any
other form,  and whether in written,  electronic or other media,  concerning the
Company's Business or incorporating or reflecting any of the Work Product, shall
be and remain the  property of and  available  to the Company at all times,  and
shall be  delivered  to the  Company  on demand  or upon  Employee  leaving  the
Company's service.  The Company may, at any time and without notice to Employee,
take  possession  of  such  records  regardless  of  their  location,  including
Employee's  files,  desk,  computer  or other  areas  under the  control  of the
Company.

      7. Assistance  After  Employment.  Employee agrees that if,  subsequent to
Employee's  employment  by the Company,  his  assistance  is needed in regard to
securing,  defending,  or enforcing any patent or copyright of which Employee is
an inventor,  co-inventor,  author or co-author Employee shall provide requested
assistance and the Company shall pay reasonable  compensation  for his time at a
rate to be agreed  upon but not higher than 150% of the last salary rate paid to
Employee by the Company during his employment,  together with full reimbursement
of reasonable and necessary directly-related expenses.

      8. Third-Party  Obligations.  Employee  acknowledges that the Company from
time to  time  may  have  agreements  with  other  person  or  entities  or with
government or other  agencies that impose  obligations  or  restrictions  on the
Company regarding Inventions,  Confidential  Information or Work Product created
by Employee or the Company  during the course of work  thereunder,  or regarding
the  confidential  nature of the work or  confidential  information of the third
party disclosed during or used as part of such work. Employee agrees to be bound
by all such  obligations and  restrictions  and to take all action  necessary to
discharge the obligations of the Company thereunder.

      9.  Warranty  by  Employee.  Employee  represents  and  warrants  that his
performance of all terms under this Agreement does not result in a breach of any
duty owed by Employee to another,  under  contract or otherwise,  or violate any
confidence of another.  Employee agrees not to disclose to the Company or induce
the Company to use any confidential or proprietary  information belonging to any
of the Employee's previous employers or others.  Employee warrants that Employee
has  executed  no  prior   noncompetition,   nondisclosure  or   confidentiality
agreements  that would in any way  interfere  with his work for or employment by
the Company.  Employee  represents and warrants that Exhibit A attached  hereto,
entitled  "List of Work  Product," is a true and complete list of all creations,
if any,  whether or not  patented or  copyrighted  and whether or not reduced to
practice,  made by Employee prior to his employment with the Company,  and which
therefore are not subject to the provisions of Paragraph 3;  provided,  however,
that any improvements, whether or not patentable or reduced to practice, made to
or on, or any  derivative  work made from,  any of the listed  confidential  and
propriety information after Employee's commencement of employment by the Company
are subject to the terms of Paragraph 3.

                                       4
<PAGE>

            Employee  agrees to notify the  Company in writing  before  Employee
makes any  disclosure  to or performs  any work on behalf of the  Company  which
appears to threaten or conflict with any  proprietary  right Employee  claims in
any Work  Product and in the event of  Employee's  failure to give such  notice,
Employee  shall make no claim  against the Company with respect to any such Work
Product.

      10. Exit Interview.  Employee  agrees that upon  termination of Employee's
employment for any reason,  Employee shall participate in an exit interview with
Company  personnel.  At or prior to the time of this  interview  Employee  shall
deliver to the Company all notes, data, reference materials, sketches, drawings,
memoranda,  correspondence,  manuals,  letters,  notebooks,  reports,  programs,
proposals,  or any other  documents,  whether in  written,  electronic  or other
media,  concerning the Company's  Business or incorporating or reflecting any of
the  Confidential  Information  or Work  Product.  Employee  agrees  that,  upon
request, Employee will execute a sworn statement that Employee has complied with
the terms of this  Paragraph,  and that should  Employee  fail to execute such a
statement  the Company may  withhold any and all amounts due to Employee for any
reason, except minimum compensation required by law.

      11. Extraordinary Relief.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
prohibiting the Company from pursuing all remedies  available to the Company for
breach of this  Agreement.  Employee  recognizes  and agrees that because of the
unique nature of the  Confidential  Information and the competitive  position of
the Company his breach of this  Agreement will  irreparably  injure the Company,
for which the Company could not  adequately be  compensated  by remedies at law.
Should  Employee  at any time  reveal or use for the  benefit  of other than the
Company  or  threaten  to so  reveal  or use  any  Confidential  Information  in
violation  of  Paragraph  2, the  Company  shall be  entitled  to an  injunction
restraining Employee from doing or continuing to do or performing any such acts,
and  Employee  hereby  consents  to the  issuance  of  such  injunction  against
Employee.  Employee  further  agrees  to waive  any  bond or  proof  of  damages
requirement that may arise if the Company is forced to seek injunctive relief to
enforce the terms of this Agreement.

      12. Accounting for Profits; Indemnification. Employee covenants and agrees
that if Employee shall violate any of Employee's  covenants or agreements  under
this Agreement,  the Company shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of
all profits,  compensation,  royalties,  commissions,  remunerations or benefits
which  Employee  directly  or  indirectly  shall have  realized  or may  realize
relating  to,  growing out of or in  connection  with any such  violation;  such
remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or
other rights or remedies to which the Company is or may be entitled at law or in
equity or otherwise  under this  Agreement.  Employee  hereby  agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold  harmless the Company  against and in respect of: (i) any and
all losses and damages  resulting from,  relating or incident to, or arising out
of any  misrepresentation  or breach by  Employee of any  warranty,  covenant or
agreement  made or  contained in this  Agreement;  and (ii) any and all actions,
suits,  proceedings,  claims, demands,  judgments,  payments, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incident to the foregoing.

                                       5

      13. Successor Employers. Employee hereby authorizes the Company to provide
a copy  of this  Agreement,  including  any  Exhibits,  to any  and  all  future
employers,  and to notify any and all future  employers that the Company intends
to exercise its legal rights arising out of or in conjunction with the Agreement
and/or any breach or any inducement of breach of it.

      14.  Reasonableness  and  Enforceability.  EMPLOYEE HAS READ AND CAREFULLY
CONSIDERED  THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT,  HAS HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY  TO  CONTACT
EMPLOYEE'S  OWN LEGAL  COUNSEL TO ADVISE  EMPLOYEE  REGARDING  THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, AND EMPLOYEE NOW AGREES THAT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE FAIR AND
REASONABLE AND ARE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE
COMPANY.  EMPLOYEE  FURTHER AGREES THAT THE  RESTRICTIONS  AND COVENANTS OF THIS
AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYEE TO SECURE  EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO
BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE  LIVING.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
enforceable  notwithstanding  the  existence  of any claim or cause of action of
Employee against the Company whether  predicated on this Agreement or otherwise.
Failure  of the  Company to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of
the conditions or covenants of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver
of such provisions or of the right of the Company to enforce subsequent breaches
of the same or other  conditions and covenants,  unless such permanent waiver is
provided to Employee in writing and signed by the  President  of the Company or,
if Employee is the President of the Company, such writing is to be signed by the
Board of Directors of the Company.

      15.  Reformation/Severability  of  Agreement.  If any  provision  of  this
Agreement   shall  for  any  reason  be  adjudged  by  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction or arbiter to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable,  such
judgment shall not affect,  impair or invalidate the remainder of this Agreement
but shall be  confined  in its  operation  to the  provision  of this  Agreement
directly  involved in the  controversy  in which such  judgment  shall have been
rendered. The invalid or unenforceable  provision shall be reformed so that each
party shall have the obligation to perform reasonably  alternatively to give the
other  party  the  benefit  of  its  bargain.   In  the  event  the  invalid  or
unenforceable provision cannot be reformed, the other provisions or applications
of this Agreement shall be given full effect,  and the invalid or  unenforceable
provision shall be deemed struck.

      16.  Construction  of Terms.  Any reference  herein to the masculine shall
include the  feminine or neuter,  and any  reference  herein to the  singular or
plural may be construed as plural or singular wherever the context requires.

      17.  Successor and Assigns.  This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Company,  its successors and assigns,  including without
limitation  any  entity  which  may  acquire  all  or  substantially  all of the
Company's  assets and business or into which the Company may be  consolidated or
merged,  and the  Employee,  his  heirs,  executors,  administrators  and  legal
representatives.  Employee  may not  assign  any of his  obligations  under this
Agreement.

      18.  Governing  Law and Venue.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed by and
construed  in  accordance  with  the laws of New York  applicable  to  contracts
between  residents of New York which are wholly  executed  and  performed in New
York. Any lawsuit brought under the terms of this Agreement shall have exclusive
venue in the state and federal  courts of New York County,  New York;  provided,
however,  that with respect to any proceeding for injunctive  relief the Company
may, at its option,  bring the proceeding  before a court where Employee resides
at the time of such proceeding.

      19. Merger.  This Agreement  constitutes the entire Agreement  between the
parties with respect to the subject matter  hereof;  and supersedes and replaces
any oral or written  communications and any undertakings  otherwise made between
the parties relating to the subject matter. Except as specified in Paragraph 15,

EXHIBIT 10.5

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT,  dated as of  December  20,  2004  (the  "Effective
Date"), between ENHANCE BIOTECH, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware ("Employer"), and Kwen-Jen Chang ("Executive").

      WHEREAS,  Executive  desires to provide  services to Employer and Employer
desires to retain the services of Executive;

      WHEREAS,  Employer  and  Executive  desire  to  formalize  the  terms  and
conditions of Executive's employment with Employer.

      NOW, THEREFORE, Employer and Executive hereby agree as follows:

      1. Employment.

            1.1. General.

                  1.1.1  Effective as of the  Effective  Date,  Employer  hereby
employs Executive in the capacity of President - Asia Pacific Operations & Chief
Science  Officer.  Executive  hereby accepts such  employment upon the terms and
subject to the conditions  herein  contained.  Commencing on the Effective Date,
Executive  shall  have the  duties  set forth on  Schedule  1  attached  hereto.
Executive agrees to perform the foregoing duties and responsibilities as well as
such other duties as may be requested by the Board of Directors of Employer (the
"Board of Directors") and the President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

                  1.1.2 During Executive's  employment with Employer,  Executive
will report directly to, and take direction from, the Board of Directors and the
President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

            1.2.  Board of  Directors.  For so long as  Executive  is serving as
President  - Asia  Pacific  Operations  & Chief  Science  Officer  of  Employer,
Executive agrees, if so requested by Employer,  to serve as a member of Board of
Directors without additional compensation.

            1.3. Exclusive  Full-Time  Position.  Executive,  during Executive's
employment  with  Employer,  will  devote  Executive's  best  efforts and all of
Executive's  business time,  attention and skills to the business and affairs of
Employer, it being understood that Executive shall not be employed by or provide
services  to any other  person  or entity  during  Executive's  employment  with
Employer.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Executive  shall be permitted to (i)
serve  as a  member  of the  board of  unaffiliated  companies  but only if such
service  is with the prior  written  consent  of the Board of  Directors,  which
consent may be withheld in the sole  discretion of the Board of Directors;  (ii)
serve on civic,  professional  or  charitable  boards or  committees,  and (iii)
manage personal investments; provided, however, that Executive may not engage in
any of the activities  described in this sentence to the extent such  activities
(x) prevent Executive from devoting  substantially  all of Executive's  business
time to Employer, (y) adversely affect the performance of Executive's duties and
responsibilities  to  Employer  or (z)  violate  any  other  provision  of  this
Agreement.

<PAGE>

            1.4.  Location  of  Employment.   Executive's   principal  place  of
employment during Executive's employment with Employer shall be in Durham, North
Carolina or such other location as Employer and Executive shall agree. Executive
acknowledges  that the proper  performance  of  Executive's  duties may  require
travel and Executive  agrees to engage in such travel as may be required  during
Executive's employment.

      2. Compensation and Benefits.

            2.1. Salary. During the period of Executive's employment pursuant to
this Agreement,  Employer will pay to Executive a base salary ("Base Salary") at
an annual rate of Two Hundred  Twenty Two Thousand  Eight Hundred Twenty Dollars
($222,820),  payable in  accordance  with the  customary  payroll  practices  of
Employer.  Executive's  Base Salary  shall be reviewed  in  accordance  with the
policy of Employer  from time to time,  but in any event no less than  annually,
and may be  subject  to upward  adjustment  based  upon,  among  other  factors,
Executive's  performance,  as determined in the sole  discretion of the Board of
Directors.  In no event shall  Executive's Base Salary in effect at a particular
time be reduced without Executive's prior written consent.

            2.2.  Additional  Compensation.  The  compensation set forth in this
Section  is in  addition  to the Base  Salary  and other  benefits  set forth in
Section 2.

                  2.2.1 Annual  Bonus.  Executive  shall be eligible for and the
Board of Directors  may, in its sole  discretion,  award  Executive a bonus (the
"Annual  Bonus")  based upon the  attainment  of  performance  targets and other
reasonable  criteria  established  by the Board of  Directors.  The Annual Bonus
shall  be paid to  Executive  at the  same  time  it is paid to  other  eligible
employees. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Executive must be
employed on the date the bonus is paid in order to earn the Annual Bonus.

                  2.2.2  Stock   Options.   As  additional   consideration   for
Executive's performance of services hereunder, upon the Effective Date, Employer
shall issue to Executive,  pursuant to Employer's 2004 Incentive  Plan,  options
(the "Options") to purchase 1 Million shares of Employer's common stock,  $0.001
par value per share.  It is intended that the maximum amount of these Options as
permitted under law qualify as an "incentive  stock option" under Section 422 of
the Code,  and to the extent  that all or any  portion of the  Options do not so
qualify,  the Options  shall be treated as  non-qualified  options.  The Options
shall have a per share  exercise  price  equal to not less than the fair  market
value on the date of grant and shall expire on a date to be  established  by the
Board of Directors or the applicable committee administering the Employer's 2004
Incentive  Plan, but no later than the tenth  anniversary of the Effective Date.
The Options are subject to the following  vesting schedule;  provided,  however,
that Executive must be an employee of Employer on the applicable vesting date in
order for such  Options to vest:  25% of the  Options  shall vest on the date of
grant and 25% of the Options  shall vest on each of the first,  second and third
anniversaries of the date of grant.

            2.3.  Executive  Benefits.  In  addition  to  the  Base  Salary  and
additional compensation set forth in Section 2, Executive shall also be entitled
to the following benefits during Executive's employment hereunder:

                  2.3.1. Expenses. Employer shall, subject to Employer's expense
reimbursement  policies as  established  or amended from time to time,  promptly
reimburse Executive for expenses Executive  reasonably incurs in connection with
the  performance  of  Executive's   duties   (including,   without   limitation,
reimbursement  for  professional  society  membership  fees and  fees to  attend
meetings  of such  professional  societies,  business  travel and  entertainment
expenses);  provided, that Executive has provided Employer with documentation of
such expenses in accordance with Employer's expense  reimbursement  policies and
applicable tax requirements.

                  2.3.2.   Employer   Plans.   Executive  will  be  entitled  to
participate  in the employee  benefit plans and programs  generally  provided to
employees  by  Employer  from  time to  time,  including,  but not  limited  to,
participation in any 401(k),  life insurance,  health and accident,  medical and
dental, disability and retirement plans and programs,  subject to and on a basis
consistent with the terms,  conditions and overall  administration of such plans
and  programs.  Employer  retains  the  unilateral  right to  amend,  modify  or
terminate any of its employee benefit plans and programs at any time.

                  2.3.3.  Vacation.  Executive  shall be entitled to twenty (20)
working  days of paid  vacation  leave per year.  Vacation  must be scheduled at
those times most convenient to Employer's  business as reasonably  determined by
the Board of Directors and the President and Chief Executive Officer.

                  2.3.4.  Coverage.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  prevent
Executive from participating in any other compensation plan or benefit plan made
available to Executive by Employer.

                  2.3.5.   Life/Key  Man  Insurance.   Providing   Executive  is
insurable at  commercially  reasonable  rates,  Employer  shall obtain term life
insurance  on the life of  Executive  in the  amount  of at least  $500,000,  at
Employer's  expense,  and  Executive  may name the  beneficiary  of the  policy.
Employer shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,  to obtain key man life
insurance on the life of employee at Employer's  expense, in reasonable amounts,
but not less than the amounts set forth in the preceding sentence.

            2.4. Taxes and Withholding.  Employer shall have the right to deduct
and withhold from all  compensation  payable to Executive  all Medicare,  social
security,  and other federal,  state and local taxes and charges which currently
are or hereafter may be required by law to be so deducted or withheld.

            2.5. Employment Term. Executive's employment by Employer pursuant to
this Agreement  shall commence as of the Effective Date and,  except as provided
in Section 3.1 hereof,  will continue at-will until the third anniversary of the
Effective  Date. On the third  anniversary  of the Effective Date this Agreement
shall  terminate  and,  unless  Executive  and  the  Employer  enter  into a new
employment agreement,  Executive shall thereafter be an employee at-will subject
to the general employment policies and practices of the Employer.

      3. Termination of Employment.

            3.1.  Events of  Termination.  Executive's  employment with Employer
will terminate upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events:

                  3.1.1.  Death. In the event of Executive's death,  Executive's
employment will terminate on the date of death.

                  3.1.2. Disability.  In the event of Executive's Disability (as
hereinafter  defined),  Employer  will have the option to terminate  Executive's
employment by giving a written  notice of such  termination  to  Executive.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means Executive's inability as a result
of a  physical  or  mental  illness  to  perform  Executive's  duties  which has
continued or is expected to continue for an aggregate of 90 days (not  including
permitted  vacation days and holidays) during any consecutive 365 day period, as
determined  in good  faith by the  Board of  Directors  upon  the  advice  of an
independent physician.

                  3.1.3. Termination by Employer for Cause.

            Employer may, at it's option,  terminate Executive's  employment for
"Cause" upon giving written notice of such termination to Executive.  As used in
this Agreement, the term "Cause" shall include but not necessarily be limited to
(i) conviction of, or plea of nolo  contendere to, a felony or a crime involving
moral  turpitude;  (ii)  engagement  in conduct which has the effect of bringing
disrepute to the Employer's  reputation or hold the Employer or the Executive up
to public ridicule;  (iii) fraud on or misappropriation of any funds or property
of the Employer,  any affiliate,  customer or vendor;  (iv) willful violation of
any law,  rule or  regulation  (other than minor  traffic  violations or similar
offenses); (v) personal dishonesty,  willful misconduct,  or breach of fiduciary
duty which involves personal profit;  (vi) gross incompetence in the performance
of the  Executive's  duties under this  Agreement;  (vii) willful  misconduct in
connection  with the  Executive's  duties or  willful  failure  to  perform  the
Executive's  responsibilities  in the  best  interests  of the  Employer;  (vii)
habitual  absenteeism or inattention to the Executive's duties; (ix) chronic use
of alcohol,  drugs or other similar  substances  (other than pursuant to medical
prescriptions  and  under  doctors'  supervision  for  treatment  of  legitimate
illnesses or conditions)  which affects the Executive's  work  performance;  (x)
violation of any Employer  rule,  regulation,  procedure or policy which has, or
may  reasonably be expected to have, a material  adverse effect on the Employer;
(xi)  engaging in behavior  that would  constitute  grounds  for  liability  for
harassment (as proscribed by the U.S. Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission
Guidelines  or any other  applicable  state or local  regulatory  body) or other
egregious


                                       13
<PAGE>

conduct that violates laws governing the workplace;  or (xii) material
breach  of  any   material   provision   of  any   employment,   non-disclosure,
non-competition,  non-solicitation  or other similar  agreement  executed by the
Executive for the benefit of the Employer (including,  without limitation,  such
provisions  within this Agreement) or of any material  Employer  policy,  all as
determined by the Board of Directors,  which  determination  will be conclusive.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary,  employment may not be terminated for
Cause in the event that the Executive becomes permanently  disabled as set forth
in this Agreement or dies. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,  the
Employer  shall give the  Executive  written  notice  prior to  terminating  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause under any  circumstance  in which the conduct
constituting  Cause  is  reasonably  open  to  cure  (for  instance,  by  way of
illustration  only,  where the Cause does not  involve a  violation  of trust or
otherwise  adversely  affect the  relationship  between  the  Executive  and the
Employer on a  going-forward  basis or involve  commission  of an act, such as a
felony, or an unauthorized  disclosure of confidential material, or an act which
may constitute  illegal  harassment  under laws  governing the workplace,  which
can't be undone),  setting forth in reasonable  detail the nature of any alleged
breach and the conduct required to cure such breach. If, and only if, the nature
of the  breach is such  that the  breach is  reasonably  open to cure,  then the
Executive  shall have  fourteen  (14) days from the giving of such notice within
which to cure such breach.

                  3.1.4. Without Cause By Employer. Employer may, at its option,
terminate  Executive's  employment for any reason whatsoever (other than for the
other reasons set forth above in this Section 3.1) by giving  written  notice of
such termination to Executive, and Executive's employment shall terminate on the
later of the date the written  notice of such  termination  is given or the date
set forth in such written notice.

                  3.1.5.  For  Good  Reason  by  Executive.  Executive  may,  at
Executive's option, terminate Executive's employment for "Good Reason" by giving
written  notice of  termination to Employer in the event that there is a failure
of Employer  (or  successor  employer)  to promptly  pay  Executive's  salary or
additional  compensation or benefits hereunder in accordance with this Agreement
in any material respect. It shall also be considered Good Reason for termination
by  Executive  if, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined  below),  any
successor  employer  fails to fully  assume  Employer's  obligations  under this
Agreement.  For purposes, of this Agreement,  a "Change of Control",  shall mean
(i) the dissolution or liquidation of Employer,  or (ii) the consummation of any
merger  or  consolidation  of  Employer  other  than in a  transaction  in which
Employer is the surviving corporation or a majority of the board of directors of
the surviving  corporation were directors of Employer before such transaction or
are designated by the former shareholders of Employer,  or (iii) a sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the then-outstanding capital stock of
Employer  or a  sale  or  other  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all of
Employer's assets. Good Reason shall also include any requirement that Executive
move his principal  office to a location  outside the Research  Triangle area of
North Carolina.

                  3.1.6.  Without  Good  Reason  By  Executive.   Executive  may
terminate Executive's  employment for any reason (other than for Good Reason) by
giving written notice of such  termination to Employer.  Executive's  employment
shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date, following the date of the notice
of  termination,  upon which a suitable  replacement  for  Executive is found by
Employer or upon which Employer makes a  determination,  in its sole discretion,
that Executive's  duties shall be undertaken by other employees of Employer,  or
(ii)  sixty  (60) days after the date of  receipt  by  Employer  of the  written
notice.

            3.2.  Certain  Obligations  of  Employer  Following  Termination  of
Executive's  Employment.  Following the  termination of  Executive's  employment

accordance with its regular  payroll  practices the following  compensation  and
provide the following benefits:

                  3.2.1.  Death;  Disability.  In  the  event  that  Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of Executive's death or Disability, Executive
or Executive's estate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the following:

                  (i) that portion of any unpaid Base Salary up to and including
the date of such  termination  and any  accrued  but unused  vacation  up to and
including the date of such termination (the "Accrued Amount");

                  (ii) any accrued but unpaid Annual Bonus for any year prior to
the year in which such termination occurred ("Prior Annual Bonuses");

                  (iii) any unreimbursed business expenses incurred prior to the
date of such termination ("Expense Reimbursement");

                  (iv) all  benefits  generally  available  under  the  employee
benefit  plans,  and the policies  and  practices  of  Employer,  determined  in
accordance with the applicable terms and provisions of such plans,  policies and
practices,  in each  case,  as  accrued  to the  date of  termination  ("Accrued
Benefits")  or  otherwise  payable  as a  consequence  of  Executive's  death or
Disability; and

                  (v) the right to exercise all options that are fully vested as
of the date of such termination for the remainder of the term of such options as
fully set forth in the applicable grant agreement.

                  3.2.2.   Without  Cause  by  Employer;   For  Good  Reason  by
Executive.  In the event that  Executive's  employment is terminated by Employer
pursuant to Section  3.1.4  hereof or by  Executive  pursuant  to Section  3.1.5
hereof, Executive shall be entitled to the following:

                  (i)  continuing  payments of then  current Base Salary for the
following period (each such period as applicable, the "Severance Period"):

                        (a) if  such  termination  occurs  prior  to  the  first
                        anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  for  the  period
                        beginning on the date of such  termination and ending on
                        the second anniversary of the Effective Date, or

                                       15
<PAGE>

                        (b) if such  termination  occurs  on or after  the first
                        anniversary  of the Effective  Date, for the twelve (12)
                        month period following such termination;

and

                  (ii) continuing  coverage under  Employer's  employee  benefit
plans  during the  Severance  Period or if earlier,  until  Executive is covered
under the employee benefit plans of another employer;

                  (iii)  the  Accrued  Amount,  Prior  Annual  Bonuses,  Expense
Reimbursement and Accrued Benefits; and

                  (iv) any unvested portion of any options previously granted to
Executive  that is  scheduled  to vest during the  Severance  Period  shall vest
immediately  as of the date of such  termination  and  Executive  shall have the
right to  exercise  all  options  that are  fully  vested as of the date of such
termination  (including,  those  vested  by  acceleration  on the  date  of such
termination) for the remainder of the term of such options as fully set forth in
the applicable grant agreement.

                  3.2.3.  Termination  by  Executive  Without  Good Reason or by
Employer  for  Cause.  In the event  Executive's  employment  is  terminated  by
Executive  pursuant  to Section  3.1.6 or Section  3.1.7  hereof or by  Employer
pursuant to Section  3.1.3  hereof,  Executive  shall be entitled to the Accrued
Amount, Expense Reimbursement and Accrued Benefits.

                  3.2.4.  Termination on the Third  Anniversary of the Effective
Date. In the event  Executive's  employment is terminated upon the expiration of
this Agreement on the third  anniversary of the Effective Date,  Executive shall
not be entitled to any  compensation,  benefits or severance of any kind, except
as required by law.

            3.3.  Nature of  Payments.  All  amounts to be paid by  Employer  to
Executive  pursuant  to this  Section  3 are  considered  by the  parties  to be
severance  payments.  In the event such  payments are treated as damages,  it is
expressly  acknowledged by the parties that damages to Executive for termination
of  employment  would be  difficult  to  ascertain  and the  above  amounts  are
reasonable estimates thereof.

            3.4. Release.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither the
Executive  nor  the  Executive's   estate  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  any
compensation,  reimbursement or benefits upon  termination of employment  (other
than as required by law) unless the Executive or the Executive's  estate, as the
case may be, executes and delivers to the Employer  promptly after termination a
written release, in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to the Employer,
by which the Executive and the Executive's  estate, as the case may be, releases
the Employer from any obligations and liabilities of any type whatsoever related
to  Executive's  employment  under this  Agreement,  except  for the  Employer's
obligations  with respect to Section 3.2 of this Agreement,  which release shall
not affect the  Executive's  estate's  right,  if any, to  indemnification  with
respect to, or  insurance  in respect of, any actions  taken within the scope of
the  Executive's  employment,  or the  Executive's or the  Executive's  estate's
rights in respect of the  Executive's  vested  securities.  The  parties  hereto
acknowledge  that the  compensation,  reimbursement  and benefits to be provided
under Section 3.2 are to be provided in  consideration  for the  above-specified
release,  as well as for Executive's  agreement to be bound by the provisions of
Section 3.5 and Section 4.

            3.5. Other Provisions Applicable to Termination of Employment.

                  (1) At any time after notice to terminate  this  Agreement has
            been served or received by the Employer, the Employer, without being
            deemed in breach of this Agreement or being deemed to be taken steps
            which would  constitute  grounds for a different kind of termination
            under this Agreement,  may require the Executive to do the following
            during the applicable notice period concluding on the effective date
            of termination of employment under this Agreement:

                        (i) work in a capacity  consistent  with the Executive's
                  then  applicable  position and status other than that in which
                  the  Executive is employed  under this  Agreement  but without
                  affecting the Executive's  fixed salary,  including  benefits;
                  and

                        (ii) remain away from work and,  although the  Executive
                  will continue to receive the  Executive's  salary and benefits
                  provided for under this Agreement during such period,  and the
                  Employer will not be obliged to provide the Executive with any
                  work  although the Employer  may, in its absolute  discretion,
                  assign to the Executive during this period, from time to time,
                  such  appropriate  tasks or  projects as may be carried out by
                  the Executive away from the Employer's offices.

                  (2) Upon termination of the Executive's  employment under this
            Agreement, the Executive shall do the following:

                        (i)  forthwith  surrender  to  the  Employer,   in  good
                  condition and working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted),
                  all Employer property in the Executive's possession including,
                  without limitation,  all books, papers and other documents (of
                  whatever  nature  and  in  whatever  media)  belonging  to the
                  Employer or its  subsidiary or associated  company or relating
                  to  the  business  of  the  Employer  or  its   subsidiary  or
                  associated companies;

                        (ii) if the  Executive  is a director of the Employer or
                  of any subsidiary or associated  company,  or if the Executive
                  is an officer of any subsidiary or any associated company, and
                  is so  requested  by the  Employer,  resign as an  officer  or
                  director, as the case may be, within forty-eight (48) hours of
                  being so requested  and,  should the  Executive  fail to do so
                  within  forty-eight  (48)  hours of being  so  requested,  the
                  Executive  irrevocably  authorizes  the Employer to appoint an
                  agent in the Executive's name and on the Executive's behalf to
                  execute  and  deliver  any  documents  and to take any and all
                  actions  reasonably  deemed by the Employer to be necessary or
                  appropriate  to  give  effect  to such  resignation(s)  by the
                  Executive; and

                                       17
<PAGE>

                        (iii)  immediately  repay all outstanding debts or loans
                  due  to the  Employer  and/or  any  subsidiary  or  associated
                  company, the Employer being expressly authorized, for purposes
                  of clarity, to deduct the same from any wages of the Executive
                  a sum in  repayment  of all or any part of any  such  debts or
                  loans.

      4. Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation; Non-Compete.

            4.1.  Confidential  and Proprietary  Information;  Non-Solicitation.
Executive's  employment  by  Employer  is subject  to  Executive  executing  the
Proprietary Rights and  Confidentiality  Agreement annexed hereto as Schedule 2.
Such agreement shall be deemed, upon execution, to be incorporated in and a part
of this Agreement.

            4.2.  Executive  acknowledges  and agrees that (a) Employer  will be
irreparably  injured in the event of a breach by Executive of any of Executive's
obligations  under  Section 4.1;  (b)  monetary  damages will not be an adequate
remedy for any such breach; (c) in the event of any such breach Employer will be
entitled to injunctive relief as a matter of right and without posting a bond or
other security, in addition to any other remedy which it may have, and Executive
shall not oppose such injunctive relief based upon the extent of the harm or the
adequacy of monetary damages.

            4.3. Non-competition and Non-solicitation.

                  (a) The Executive agrees and acknowledges  that, in connection
with  the  Executive's  employment  with the  Employer,  the  Executive  will be
provided with access to and become  familiar with  confidential  and proprietary
information  and trade  secrets  belonging to the  Employer.  Executive  further
acknowledges  and agrees that,  given the nature of this  information  and trade
secrets,  it is likely that such  information and trade secrets would inevitably
be used or revealed, either directly or indirectly, in any subsequent employment
with a competitor of the Employer in any position comparable to the position the
Executive  holds  with  the  Employer  under  this  Agreement.  Accordingly,  in
consideration of the Executive's  employment with the Employer  pursuant to this
Agreement,  and other good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, Executive agrees that, while the Executive is in the employ
of the Employer and for a period equal to the greater of the period during which
the Executive  receives any severance  pursuant to this  Agreement,  if any, and
Twelve (12) months after the  termination  of the  Executive's  employment,  the
Executive  shall not,  either on the  Executive's own behalf or on behalf of any
third  party,  except on  behalf  of the  Employer  or,  with the prior  written
agreement of the Employer (not to be unreasonably  withheld) or any affiliate of
the Employer, directly or indirectly:

                  (1) Other than through the  Executive's  ownership of stock of
the Employer,  directly or indirectly,  own,  manage,  operate,  join,  control,
finance or participate  in the ownership,  management,  operation,  control,  or
financing of, or be connected as a proprietor,  partner,  stockholder,  officer,
director,  principal, agent,  representative,  joint venturer, investor, lender,
consultant or otherwise with, or use or permit the  Executive's  name to be used

                                       18
<PAGE>

in connection with, any business or enterprise engaged directly or indirectly in
competition with the Business Conducted by the Employer (as hereinafter defined)
at any time  during  such  period,  and any other  business  ("Other  Business")
engaged in by the Employer that Executive is or has been directly  involved with
during the Twelve (12) month period  immediately  preceding  termination  of the
Executive's employment.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Business Conducted
by the Employer" shall mean the discovery, clinical or pre-clinical development,
sale  and/or  manufacture  of drugs  or drug  candidates  that  are  known to be
pharmacologically  active  at the  delta  and/or  mu cell  receptor(s),  and the
acquisition, licensing, development,  manufacturing,  marketing and distribution
of drugs and treatments for such other  conditions as the Employer is engaged in
addressing during the Twelve (12) month period immediately preceding termination
of the  Executive's  employment.  The  foregoing,  however,  shall  not  prevent
Executive from performing  services for a business engaged in the  biotechnology
or  biopharmaceutical  businesses  generally which is not  competitive  with the
Employer,  or for a competitive  business if such  competitive  business is also
engaged in lines of  business  which do not  compete  with the  Employer  and if
Executive's  services  are  restricted  to  employment  in such  other  lines of
business.  It is  recognized by the Executive and the Employer that the Business
Conducted  by the  Employer  is and is  expected  to  continue  to be  conducted
throughout  the United States and the world,  and that more narrow  geographical
limitations   of  any  nature  on  this   non-competition   covenant   (and  the
non-solicitation  provisions  set  forth  in  clauses  (2)  and (3)  below)  are
therefore not appropriate.  The foregoing  restriction shall not be construed to
prohibit the ownership by Executive as a passive investment of not more than one
percent  (1%) percent of any class of  securities  of any  corporation  which is
engaged  in any  of the  foregoing  businesses  having  a  class  of  securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                  (2) Attempt in any manner to solicit from a current  client or
customer of the Employer at the time of the Executive's termination, business of
the type  performed by the Employer or to persuade any client of the Employer to
cease to do  business  or change  the  nature of the  business  or to reduce the
amount of  business  which any such  client  has  customarily  done or  actively
contemplates doing with the Employer; or

                  (3)  Recruit,  solicit  or induce,  or attempt to induce,  any
person  or  entity  which,  at the time of the  termination  of the  Executive's
employment  or at any time  during the Twelve  (12) month  period  prior to such
termination was an employee of the Employer or its affiliates, to terminate such
employee's employment with, or otherwise cease such employee's relationship with
the Employer or its affiliates.  As used in this Agreement,  an affiliate of the
Employer is any person or entity that,  directly or  indirectly,  through one or
more intermediaries,  controls,  or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the Employer.

            (b) The parties  agree that the relevant  public  policy  aspects of
covenants  not to compete  have been  discussed,  and that every effort has been
made to limit the  restrictions  placed  upon the  Executive  to those  that are
reasonable  and  necessary  to  protect  the  Employer's  legitimate  interests.
Executive acknowledges that, based upon the Executive's  education,  experience,
and training,  this  non-compete  provision  will not prevent the Executive from
earning a livelihood and supporting  himself and the  Executive's  family during
the relevant time period.

            (c) If any  restriction  set  forth in  Section  4.3 is found by any
court of competent  jurisdiction to be unenforceable  because it extends for too
long a period  of time or over too  great a range of  activities  or  geographic
area, it shall be interpreted  to extend over the maximum period of time,  range
of activities or geographic areas as to which it may be enforceable.

                                       19
<PAGE>

            (d)  The  restrictions  contained  in  4.3  are  necessary  for  the
protection  of the business and goodwill of the Employer  and/or its  affiliates
and are  considered  by the Executive to be reasonable  for such  purposes.  The
Executive agrees that any material breach of Section 4.3 will cause the Employer
and/or its affiliates  substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore,  in the
event of any such  breach,  in  addition  to such  other  remedies  which may be
available,  the Employer shall have the right to seek specific  performance  and
injunctive relief.

            (e) The  provisions  of Section  4.3 shall  survive  termination  or
expiration of this Agreement.

            (f) EXECUTIVE HAS READ AND  CAREFULLY  CONSIDERED  THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT,  HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT  EXECUTIVE'S OWN LEGAL COUNSEL TO
ADVISE EXECUTIVE REGARDING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EXECUTIVE NOW AGREES
THAT THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT  ARE FAIR AND  REASONABLE  AND ARE  REASONABLY
REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYER.  EXECUTIVE  FURTHER
AGREES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE
ABILITY OF EXECUTIVE TO SECURE  EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE
LIVING.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be enforceable  notwithstanding
the existence of any claim or cause of action of Executive  against the Employer
whether  predicated on this  Agreement or otherwise.  Failure of the Employer to
enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the conditions or covenants
of this  Agreement  shall not be construed as a waiver of such  provisions or of
the right of the  Employer to enforce  subsequent  breaches of the same or other
conditions and covenants,  unless such permanent waiver is provided to Executive
in writing and signed by the  President  of the Employer or, if Executive is the
President  of the  Employer,  such writing is to be signed by the officer of the
Employer designated for such purpose by the Board of Directors.

            (g)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein which may be construed to the
contrary,  Executive shall be free to use and employ Executive's general skills,
know-how and expertise,  and to use, disclose and employ any generalized  ideas,
concepts,  know-how,  methods, techniques or skills gained or learned during the
course of providing the services  hereunder,  so long as Executive  acquires and
applies this  information  without  violating the terms of this Paragraph 4.3 or
the Proprietary Rights and  Confidentiality  Agreement executed and delivered by
the Executive to the Employer in connection herewith.

            (h) The term of this non-competition covenant shall be tolled during
any period of actual  competition or breach of this Section 4.3 by the Executive
and/or any period of litigation to enforce  Executive's  obligations  under this
Agreement.

      5. Indemnification. Executive shall be covered by the Employer's directors
and officers liability insurance policy, and errors and omissions  coverage,  to
the same  extent  such  coverage is  generally  provided by the  Employer to its
directors  and officers and to the fullest  extent  permitted by such  insurance
policies. In addition,  the Employer shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless
from all liability to the fullest extent permitted by the Employer's  bylaws and
applicable law.

                                       20

      6. Miscellaneous Provisions.

            6.1.  Severability.  If in any  jurisdiction  any term or  provision
hereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) the remaining terms and
provisions   hereof   shall  be   unimpaired,   (b)  any  such   invalidity   or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other  jurisdiction,  and (c) the invalid or
unenforceable  term or provision  shall, for purposes of such  jurisdiction,  be
deemed  replaced by a term or provision that is valid and  enforceable  and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or  unenforceable  term
or provision.

            6.2.  Execution in  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
one or more  counterparts,  and by the  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to be an original  but all of which
taken together  shall  constitute one and the same agreement (and all signatures
need not  appear  on any one  counterpart),  and  this  Agreement  shall  become
effective when one or more  counterparts  has been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to each of the other parties hereto.

            6.3.   Notices.   All   notices,   requests,   demands   and   other

assets of Employer.

            6.9. Waiver,  etc. The failure of either of the parties hereto to at
any time enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement  shall not be deemed or
construed  to be a waiver of any such  provision,  nor to in any way  affect the
validity of this Agreement or any provision hereof or the right of either of the
parties hereto to thereafter enforce each and every provision of this Agreement.
No waiver of any  breach of any of the  provisions  of this  Agreement  shall be
effective unless set forth in a written instrument executed by the party against
whom or which  enforcement  of such waiver is sought,  and no waiver of any such
breach shall be  construed  or deemed to be a waiver of any other or  subsequent
breach.

            6.10.  Continuing  Effect.  Where  the  context  of  this  Agreement
requires, the respective rights and obligations of the parties shall survive any

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is made this __ day of December,  2004,  between Enhance Biotech,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its offices at 712 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY
10019 (the "Company"),  and Kwen-Jen Chang, an individual residing at 104 Sierra
Drive,  Chapel  Hill,  NC 27514  ("Employee").  This  Agreement  is based on the
following understandings:

      A.  Employee  is a valued  employee  and officer of the Company and has an
      interest  as an  employee  and  officer  in the  continued  success of the
      Company; and

      B. The Company and Employee wish to set forth certain agreements regarding
      the terms of Employee's employment; and

      C.  Employee  is  entering  into an  agreement  simultaneously  with  this
      Agreement concerning his duties and compensation as an officer of Company.

      THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the employment of Employee by
the Company,  the  disclosure  by the Company of  confidential  and trade secret
information,  and the mutual  promises  and  agreements  in this  document,  the
parties to this Agreement contract as follows:

      1. Confidential  Information.  Employee may gain access to or knowledge of
information  about Company  and/or  Company  clients and  customers  that is not
generally  known  or  available  to  the  public  ("Confidential  Information").
Confidential  Information  may include,  but is not limited to:  Inventions  (as
defined  below),  research  results,  specifications,  models,  diagrams,  data,
flowcharts,  spreadsheets,  marketing and development  plans,  chemical compound
structures,  synthesis  methods,  pre-clinical  and  clinical  data,  regulatory
filings,  content of  negotiations  with potential  licensees  and/or  partners,
financial investors or affiliates, client names and other information related to
current and potential clients (including  without  limitation names,  addresses,
phone  and  fax  numbers,   and  services  requested  and  provided  and  client
information   acquired  in  the  course  of  providing   services  to  clients),
prospective  client  lists,  price  lists,  pricing  policies,  supplier  lists,
financial  information  and  employee  files.  It shall  also  include,  without
limitation, data, notes, records, files, memoranda,  reports, designs, drawings,
plans,  sketches,  documents,  print-outs,  and the  like,  in any way or in any
medium  incorporating  or reflecting  any of the  Confidential  Information,  or
relating to the Company's Business (as defined below) or to any client,  vendor,
licensor,  licensee or other party transacting business with the Company and any
information which Employee made or makes,  conceived or conceives,  developed or
develops or obtained or obtains  knowledge  or access  through or as a result of
Employee's  relationship  with  the  Company  (including  information  received,
originated,  discovered  or developed in whole or in part by Employee)  from the
initial  date  of  Employee's  employment  with  the  Company.  As  used in this
Agreement,  the term "Company's Business" shall mean the discovery,  clinical or
pre-clinical  development,  sale and/or  manufacture of drugs or drug candidates
that are  known to be  pharmacologically  active  at the  delta  and/or  mu cell
receptor(s),  and  the  acquisition,   licensing,  development,   manufacturing,
marketing and  distribution of drugs and treatments for such other conditions as
the Company is engaged in  addressing  during the  Employee's  employment by the
Company.  Confidential Information also includes any information described above
which the Company  obtains  from another  party and which the Company  treats as
proprietary or designates as Confidential  Information,  whether or not owned or
developed  by the  Company,  including  without  limitation,  information  of or
concerning  the Company's  clients,  partners,  financial  investors or business
collaborators.  The  failure of the  Company to mark any of the  above-described
information as proprietary,  confidential, or secret shall not affect its status
as part of the Confidential Information protected by this Agreement.

                                       1
<PAGE>

            For the purposes of this Agreement,  "Inventions"  shall mean ideas,
designs, creations, concepts, techniques, inventions, improvements, discoveries,
and works of  authorship,  whether or not patentable or protectable by copyright
or patent,  whether or not fixed in a tangible  medium of expression and whether
or not reduced to practice,  including but not limited to the nature and results
of research and development activities,  processes,  formulae, devices, designs,
processes,  computer  programs,  and  methods,  together  with any  improvements
thereon or thereto,  derivative  works or applications  derived  therefrom,  and
know-how related thereto.

            Information  publicly known that is generally  employed by the trade
at or after the time Employee first learns of such information  (other than as a
result of a breach by  Employee  of any duty owed to,  or  agreement  with,  the
Company),  or generic information or knowledge which Employee would have learned
in the course of similar  employment or work elsewhere in the trade shall not be
deemed part of the Confidential Information.

      2.  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information.  Employee  agrees  that
Employee  has a fiduciary  duty to the Company and that  Employee  shall hold in
confidence  and  shall  not,  except  in the  course  of  performing  Employee's
employment obligations or pursuant to written authorization from the Company, at
any  time  during  or  for  ten  (10)  years  after  termination  of  Employee's
relationship  with the  Company  (a)  directly  or  indirectly  reveal,  report,
publish,  disclose or transfer the Confidential  Information or any part thereof
to any person or entity;  (b) directly or  indirectly  use, or permit the use of
any of the  Confidential  Information  or any part thereof for any purpose other
than for the benefit of the Company;  (c) assist any person or entity other than
the Company to secure any benefit from the Confidential  Information or any part
thereof or (d) solicit (on  Employee's  behalf or on behalf of any third  party)
any  employee of the Company for the purpose of  providing  services or products
which Employee is prohibited from providing hereunder.

      3.  Ownership of  Confidential  Information  and Work  Product.  Except as
limited by this Paragraph, Employee agrees that all Confidential Information and
all other work  product of any type or nature  created by Employee or  resulting
from  work  performed  by  Employee  for the  Company,  or using  the  Company's
facilities,  equipment,  supplies or other property, or related to the Company's
Business,  even if not Confidential  Information (such Confidential  Information
and work product being defined as "Work  Product"),  shall belong to the Company
exclusively and without any additional compensation to Employee. Employee agrees
that any original  copyrightable Work Product shall be considered as "works made
for hire," and that the  Company  shall be deemed the author  thereof,  provided
that to the extent such Work Product is determined not to constitute "works made
for hire" as a matter of law, Employee hereby irrevocably  assigns and transfers
to the Company all rights in and to such Work Product.

                                       2
<PAGE>

            The  Company's  ownership  right to such Work  Product  shall extend
regardless  of the hours during which or facilities at which the Work Product is
made or the  resources or ownership  of  resources  used in making it;  provided
however that the  assignment  of rights  shall not apply to creations  developed
entirely  on  Employee's  own  time  without  using  the  Company's  facilities,
equipment, supplies or other property, Confidential Information or Work Product,
provided  that the  creations  do not (a) relate to the  Company's  Business  or
actual or demonstrably  anticipated research or development,  or (b) result from
any work performed by Employee for the Company.

            Upon request  Employee will execute any instrument  required to vest
in the Company  complete  title and ownership to all Work Product,  and will, at
the request and expense of the  Company,  execute any  instruments  necessary to
obtain legal protection in the United States and foreign  countries for all Work
Product  and for the purpose of vesting  title  thereto in the  Company,  or its
nominee, all without any additional  compensation of any kind to Employee.  Only
if the Company  executes a written  statement  that it does not desire to obtain
protection for a particular Invention or copyrightable creation is Employee free
to obtain  protection  in  Employee's  own name and at  Employee's  own expense;
provided,  however,  that the  Company  shall have a  royalty-free  nonexclusive
irrevocable license under any patent or copyright so obtained by Employee.

      4.  Disclosure to the Company.  Upon the conception of any Work Product by
Employee  (either solely or in conjunction  with others) and without  waiting to
perfect or  complete  it,  Employee  promises  and agrees  immediately  to fully
disclose  to the  President  and Chief  Executive  Officer  or other  applicable
officer of the Company designated by the Board of Directors of the Company,  and
to no one else,  and  thereafter  to treat the Work  Product as the property and
secret of the  Company.  This shall  include  Work  Product  made,  conceived or
reduced to practice after the term of Employee's  employment but which belong to
the Company  pursuant to  Paragraphs 3 and 9. Upon request  Employee will reduce
any concept in the Work Product to writing and deliver all copies of the writing
to the President of the Company, or if Employee is the President of the Company,
such copies shall be  delivered  to such other  officer of the Company as may be
designated  by the Board of Directors of the Company.  These  obligations  shall
continue  beyond the  termination  of  employment  with  respect to Work Product
conceived or made during the period of employment.

      5.  Collaboration.  Employee  warrants  that  Employee  will  disclose the
participation  of any other  person in any of  Employee's  work for the Company.
Absent such  disclosure,  Employee  warrants that all work performed by Employee
will be Employee's own and that no other person shall have any right,  title, or
interest in any work submitted to the Company.

                                       3
<PAGE>

      6. Records.  Employee agrees that Employee will keep and maintain adequate
and current written records of all Work Product created by Employee. All written
records  relating  to any Work  Product,  whether  in the form of  notes,  data,
reference materials, sketches, drawings, memoranda, correspondence,  blueprints,
manuals, letters, notebooks,  reports, flowcharts,  programs,  proposals, or any
other form,  and whether in written,  electronic or other media,  concerning the
Company's Business or incorporating or reflecting any of the Work Product, shall
be and remain the  property of and  available  to the Company at all times,  and
shall be  delivered  to the  Company  on demand  or upon  Employee  leaving  the
Company's service.  The Company may, at any time and without notice to Employee,
take  possession  of  such  records  regardless  of  their  location,  including
Employee's  files,  desk,  computer  or other  areas  under the  control  of the
Company.

      7. Assistance  After  Employment.  Employee agrees that if,  subsequent to
Employee's  employment  by the Company,  his  assistance  is needed in regard to
securing,  defending,  or enforcing any patent or copyright of which Employee is
an inventor,  co-inventor,  author or co-author Employee shall provide requested
assistance and the Company shall pay reasonable  compensation  for his time at a
rate to be agreed  upon but not higher than 150% of the last salary rate paid to
Employee by the Company during his employment,  together with full reimbursement
of reasonable and necessary directly-related expenses.

      8. Third-Party  Obligations.  Employee  acknowledges that the Company from
time to  time  may  have  agreements  with  other  person  or  entities  or with
government or other  agencies that impose  obligations  or  restrictions  on the
Company regarding Inventions,  Confidential  Information or Work Product created
by Employee or the Company  during the course of work  thereunder,  or regarding
the  confidential  nature of the work or  confidential  information of the third
party disclosed during or used as part of such work. Employee agrees to be bound
by all such  obligations and  restrictions  and to take all action  necessary to
discharge the obligations of the Company thereunder.

      9.  Warranty  by  Employee.  Employee  represents  and  warrants  that his
performance of all terms under this Agreement does not result in a breach of any
duty owed by Employee to another,  under  contract or otherwise,  or violate any
confidence of another.  Employee agrees not to disclose to the Company or induce
the Company to use any confidential or proprietary  information belonging to any
of the Employee's previous employers or others.  Employee warrants that Employee
has  executed  no  prior   noncompetition,   nondisclosure  or   confidentiality
agreements  that would in any way  interfere  with his work for or employment by
the Company.  Employee  represents and warrants that Exhibit A attached  hereto,
entitled  "List of Work  Product," is a true and complete list of all creations,
if any,  whether or not  patented or  copyrighted  and whether or not reduced to
practice,  made by Employee prior to his employment with the Company,  and which
therefore are not subject to the provisions of Paragraph 3;  provided,  however,
that any improvements, whether or not patentable or reduced to practice, made to
or on, or any  derivative  work made from,  any of the listed  confidential  and
propriety information after Employee's commencement of employment by the Company
are subject to the terms of Paragraph 3.

                                       4
<PAGE>

            Employee  agrees to notify the  Company in writing  before  Employee
makes any  disclosure  to or performs  any work on behalf of the  Company  which
appears to threaten or conflict with any  proprietary  right Employee  claims in
any Work  Product and in the event of  Employee's  failure to give such  notice,
Employee  shall make no claim  against the Company with respect to any such Work
Product.

      10. Exit Interview.  Employee  agrees that upon  termination of Employee's
employment for any reason,  Employee shall participate in an exit interview with
Company  personnel.  At or prior to the time of this  interview  Employee  shall
deliver to the Company all notes, data, reference materials, sketches, drawings,
memoranda,  correspondence,  manuals,  letters,  notebooks,  reports,  programs,
proposals,  or any other  documents,  whether in  written,  electronic  or other
media,  concerning the Company's  Business or incorporating or reflecting any of
the  Confidential  Information  or Work  Product.  Employee  agrees  that,  upon
request, Employee will execute a sworn statement that Employee has complied with
the terms of this  Paragraph,  and that should  Employee  fail to execute such a
statement  the Company may  withhold any and all amounts due to Employee for any
reason, except minimum compensation required by law.

      11. Extraordinary Relief.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
prohibiting the Company from pursuing all remedies  available to the Company for
breach of this  Agreement.  Employee  recognizes  and agrees that because of the
unique nature of the  Confidential  Information and the competitive  position of
the Company his breach of this  Agreement will  irreparably  injure the Company,
for which the Company could not  adequately be  compensated  by remedies at law.
Should  Employee  at any time  reveal or use for the  benefit  of other than the
Company  or  threaten  to so  reveal  or use  any  Confidential  Information  in
violation  of  Paragraph  2, the  Company  shall be  entitled  to an  injunction
restraining Employee from doing or continuing to do or performing any such acts,
and  Employee  hereby  consents  to the  issuance  of  such  injunction  against
Employee.  Employee  further  agrees  to waive  any  bond or  proof  of  damages
requirement that may arise if the Company is forced to seek injunctive relief to
enforce the terms of this Agreement.

      12. Accounting for Profits; Indemnification. Employee covenants and agrees
that if Employee shall violate any of Employee's  covenants or agreements  under
this Agreement,  the Company shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of
all profits,  compensation,  royalties,  commissions,  remunerations or benefits
which  Employee  directly  or  indirectly  shall have  realized  or may  realize
relating  to,  growing out of or in  connection  with any such  violation;  such
remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or
other rights or remedies to which the Company is or may be entitled at law or in
equity or otherwise  under this  Agreement.  Employee  hereby  agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold  harmless the Company  against and in respect of: (i) any and
all losses and damages  resulting from,  relating or incident to, or arising out
of any  misrepresentation  or breach by  Employee of any  warranty,  covenant or
agreement  made or  contained in this  Agreement;  and (ii) any and all actions,
suits,  proceedings,  claims, demands,  judgments,  payments, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incident to the foregoing.

                                       5
<PAGE>

      13. Successor Employers. Employee hereby authorizes the Company to provide
a copy  of this  Agreement,  including  any  Exhibits,  to any  and  all  future
employers,  and to notify any and all future  employers that the Company intends
to exercise its legal rights arising out of or in conjunction with the Agreement
and/or any breach or any inducement of breach of it.

      14.  Reasonableness  and  Enforceability.  EMPLOYEE HAS READ AND CAREFULLY
CONSIDERED  THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT,  HAS HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY  TO  CONTACT
EMPLOYEE'S  OWN LEGAL  COUNSEL TO ADVISE  EMPLOYEE  REGARDING  THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, AND EMPLOYEE NOW AGREES THAT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE FAIR AND
REASONABLE AND ARE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE
COMPANY.  EMPLOYEE  FURTHER AGREES THAT THE  RESTRICTIONS  AND COVENANTS OF THIS
AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYEE TO SECURE  EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO
BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE  LIVING.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
enforceable  notwithstanding  the  existence  of any claim or cause of action of
Employee against the Company whether  predicated on this Agreement or otherwise.
Failure  of the  Company to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of
the conditions or covenants of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver
of such provisions or of the right of the Company to enforce subsequent breaches
of the same or other  conditions and covenants,  unless such permanent waiver is
provided to Employee in writing and signed by the  President  of the Company or,
if Employee is the President of the Company, such writing is to be signed by the
Board of Directors of the Company.

      15.  Reformation/Severability  of  Agreement.  If any  provision  of  this
Agreement   shall  for  any  reason  be  adjudged  by  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction or arbiter to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable,  such
judgment shall not affect,  impair or invalidate the remainder of this Agreement
but shall be  confined  in its  operation  to the  provision  of this  Agreement
directly  involved in the  controversy  in which such  judgment  shall have been
rendered. The invalid or unenforceable  provision shall be reformed so that each
party shall have the obligation to perform reasonably  alternatively to give the
other  party  the  benefit  of  its  bargain.   In  the  event  the  invalid  or
unenforceable provision cannot be reformed, the other provisions or applications
of this Agreement shall be given full effect,  and the invalid or  unenforceable
provision shall be deemed struck.

      16.  Construction  of Terms.  Any reference  herein to the masculine shall
include the  feminine or neuter,  and any  reference  herein to the  singular or
plural may be construed as plural or singular wherever the context requires.

      17.  Successor and Assigns.  This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Company,  its successors and assigns,  including without
limitation  any  entity  which  may  acquire  all  or  substantially  all of the
Company's  assets and business or into which the Company may be  consolidated or
merged,  and the  Employee,  his  heirs,  executors,  administrators  and  legal
representatives.  Employee  may not  assign  any of his  obligations  under this
Agreement.

                                       6
<PAGE>

      18.  Governing  Law and Venue.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed by and
construed  in  accordance  with  the laws of New York  applicable  to  contracts
between  residents of New York which are wholly  executed  and  performed in New
York. Any lawsuit brought under the terms of this Agreement shall have exclusive
venue in the state and federal  courts of New York County,  New York;  provided,
however,  that with respect to any proceeding for injunctive  relief the Company
may, at its option,  bring the proceeding  before a court where Employee resides
at the time of such proceeding.

      19. Merger.  This Agreement  constitutes the entire Agreement  between the
parties with respect to the subject matter  hereof;  and supersedes and replaces
any oral or written  communications and any undertakings  otherwise made between
the parties relating to the subject matter. Except as specified in Paragraph 15,
no changes,  modifications,  or amendments  of any terms and  conditions of this
Agreement are valid or binding  unless agreed to in a writing signed by Employee
and the President of the Company or, if Employee is the President,  the Board of
Directors of the Company.

EXHIBIT 10.6

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

      EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT,  dated as of  December  20,  2004  (the  "Effective
Date"), between ENHANCE BIOTECH, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware ("Employer"), and Phillip S. Wise ("Executive").

      WHEREAS,  Executive  desires to provide  services to Employer and Employer
desires to retain the services of Executive;

      WHEREAS,  Employer  and  Executive  desire  to  formalize  the  terms  and
conditions of Executive's employment with Employer.

      NOW, THEREFORE, Employer and Executive hereby agree as follows:

      1. Employment.

            1.1. General.

                  1.1.1  Effective as of the  Effective  Date,  Employer  hereby
employs Executive in the capacity of Chief Financial  Officer.  Executive hereby
accepts  such  employment  upon the terms and subject to the  conditions  herein
contained. Commencing on the Effective Date, Executive shall have the duties set
forth on Schedule 1 attached  hereto.  Executive agrees to perform the foregoing
duties and  responsibilities as well as such other duties as may be requested by
the Board of Directors of Employer (the "Board of Directors")  and the President
and Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

                  1.1.2 During Executive's  employment with Employer,  Executive
will report directly to, and take direction from, the Board of Directors and the
President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

            1.2.  Board of  Directors.  For so long as  Executive  is serving as
Chief  Financial  Officer of  Employer,  Executive  agrees,  if so  requested by
Employer,  to serve  as a  member  of  Board  of  Directors  without  additional
compensation.

            1.3. Exclusive  Full-Time  Position.  Executive,  during Executive's
employment  with  Employer,  will  devote  Executive's  best  efforts and all of
Executive's  business time,  attention and skills to the business and affairs of
Employer, it being understood that Executive shall not be employed by or provide
services  to any other  person  or entity  during  Executive's  employment  with
Employer.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Executive  shall be permitted to (i)
serve  as a  member  of the  board of  unaffiliated  companies  but only if such
service  is with the prior  written  consent  of the Board of  Directors,  which
consent may be withheld in the sole  discretion of the Board of Directors;  (ii)
serve on civic,  professional  or  charitable  boards or  committees,  and (iii)
manage personal investments; provided, however, that Executive may not engage in
any of the activities  described in this sentence to the extent such  activities
(x) prevent Executive from devoting  substantially  all of Executive's  business
time to Employer, (y) adversely affect the performance of Executive's duties and
responsibilities  to  Employer  or (z)  violate  any  other  provision  of  this
Agreement.

<PAGE>

            1.4.  Location  of  Employment.   Executive's   principal  place  of
employment during Executive's employment with Employer shall be in Durham, North
Carolina or such other location as Employer and Executive shall agree. Executive
acknowledges  that the proper  performance  of  Executive's  duties may  require
travel and Executive  agrees to engage in such travel as may be required  during
Executive's employment.

      2. Compensation and Benefits.

            2.1. Salary. During the period of Executive's employment pursuant to
this Agreement,  Employer will pay to Executive a base salary ("Base Salary") at
an annual rate of Two Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars  ($225,000),  payable
in accordance with the customary payroll practices of Employer. Executive's Base
Salary shall be reviewed in accordance  with the policy of Employer from time to
time,  but in any  event no less than  annually,  and may be  subject  to upward
adjustment  based  upon,  among  other  factors,   Executive's  performance,  as
determined in the sole  discretion of the Board of Directors.  In no event shall
Executive's  Base  Salary in  effect at a  particular  time be  reduced  without
Executive's prior written consent.

            2.2.  Additional  Compensation.  The  compensation set forth in this
Section  is in  addition  to the Base  Salary  and other  benefits  set forth in
Section 2.

                  2.2.1 Annual Bonus.

                  (a) Executive shall be eligible for and the Board of Directors
may, in its sole discretion,  award Executive a bonus (the "Annual Bonus") based
upon the  attainment  of  performance  targets  and  other  reasonable  criteria
established  by the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Annual  Bonus  shall be paid to
Executive  at the same time it is paid to other  eligible  employees.  Except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, Executive must be employed on the date
the bonus is paid in order to earn the Annual Bonus.

                  (b) In  addition  to the  discretionary  bonus  set  forth  in
Section 2.2.1(a) above, Executive shall receive a stock bonus in an amount equal
to Thirty Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000) on each of the first, second and third
anniversaries of the Effective Date which shares shall be registered pursuant to
a  Registration  Statement on Form S-8 which shall be filed with the  Securities
Exchange Commission.

                  2.2.2  Stock   Options.   As  additional   consideration   for
Executive's performance of services hereunder, upon the Effective Date, Employer
shall issue to Executive,  pursuant to Employer's 2004 Incentive  Plan,  options
(the  "Options")  to purchase 1.2 Million  shares of  Employer's  common  stock,
$0.001 par value per share.  It is  intended  that the  maximum  amount of these
Options as permitted  under law qualify as an  "incentive  stock  option"  under
Section  422 of the  Code,  and to the  extent  that all or any  portion  of the
Options  do not so  qualify,  the  Options  shall be  treated  as  non-qualified
options.  The Options  shall have a per share  exercise  price equal to not less
than the fair market value on the date of grant and shall expire on a date to be
established by the Board of Directors or the applicable committee  administering
the Employer's 2004 Incentive  Plan, but no later than the tenth  anniversary of
the Effective Date. The Options are subject to the following  vesting  schedule;
provided,  however,  that  Executive  must be an  employee  of  Employer  on the
applicable  vesting date in order for such  Options to vest:  25% of the Options
shall vest on the date of grant and 25% of the Options shall vest on each of the
first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.

                                       11

                  2.3.  Executive  Benefits.  In addition to the Base Salary and
additional compensation set forth in Section 2, Executive shall also be entitled
to the following benefits during Executive's employment hereunder:

                  2.3.1. Expenses. Employer shall, subject to Employer's expense
reimbursement  policies as  established  or amended from time to time,  promptly
reimburse Executive for expenses Executive  reasonably incurs in connection with
the  performance  of  Executive's   duties   (including,   without   limitation,
reimbursement  for  professional  society  membership  fees and  fees to  attend
meetings  of such  professional  societies,  business  travel and  entertainment
expenses);  provided, that Executive has provided Employer with documentation of
such expenses in accordance with Employer's expense  reimbursement  policies and
applicable tax requirements.

                  2.3.2.   Employer   Plans.   Executive  will  be  entitled  to
participate  in the employee  benefit plans and programs  generally  provided to
employees  by  Employer  from  time to  time,  including,  but not  limited  to,
participation in any 401(k),  life insurance,  health and accident,  medical and
dental, disability and retirement plans and programs,  subject to and on a basis
consistent with the terms,  conditions and overall  administration of such plans
and  programs.  Employer  retains  the  unilateral  right to  amend,  modify  or
terminate any of its employee benefit plans and programs at any time.

                  2.3.3.  Vacation.  Executive  shall be entitled to twenty (20)
working  days of paid  vacation  leave per year.  Vacation  must be scheduled at
those times most convenient to Employer's  business as reasonably  determined by
the Board of Directors and the President and Chief Executive Officer.

                  2.3.4.  Coverage.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  prevent
Executive from participating in any other compensation plan or benefit plan made
available to Executive by Employer.

                  2.3.5.   Life/Key  Man  Insurance.   Providing   Executive  is
insurable at  commercially  reasonable  rates,  Employer  shall obtain term life
insurance  on the life of  Executive  in the  amount  of at least  $500,000,  at
Employer's  expense,  and  Executive  may name the  beneficiary  of the  policy.
Employer shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,  to obtain key man life
insurance on the life of employee at Employer's  expense, in reasonable amounts,
but not less than the amounts set forth in the preceding sentence.

                                       12

            2.4. Taxes and Withholding.  Employer shall have the right to deduct
and withhold from all  compensation  payable to Executive  all Medicare,  social
security,  and other federal,  state and local taxes and charges which currently
are or hereafter may be required by law to be so deducted or withheld.

            2.5. Employment Term. Executive's employment by Employer pursuant to
this Agreement  shall commence as of the Effective Date and,  except as provided
in Section 3.1 hereof,  will continue at-will until the third anniversary of the
Effective  Date. On the third  anniversary  of the Effective Date this Agreement
shall  terminate  and,  unless  Executive  and  the  Employer  enter  into a new
employment agreement,  Executive shall thereafter be an employee at-will subject
to the general employment policies and practices of the Employer.

      3. Termination of Employment.

            3.1.  Events of  Termination.  Executive's  employment with Employer
will terminate upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events:

                  3.1.1.  Death. In the event of Executive's death,  Executive's
employment will terminate on the date of death.

                  3.1.2. Disability.  In the event of Executive's Disability (as
hereinafter  defined),  Employer  will have the option to terminate  Executive's
employment by giving a written  notice of such  termination  to  Executive.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means Executive's inability as a result
of a  physical  or  mental  illness  to  perform  Executive's  duties  which has
continued or is expected to continue for an aggregate of 90 days (not  including
permitted  vacation days and holidays) during any consecutive 365 day period, as
determined  in good  faith by the  Board of  Directors  upon  the  advice  of an
independent physician.

                  3.1.3. Termination by Employer for Cause.

            Employer may, at it's option,  terminate Executive's  employment for
"Cause" upon giving written notice of such termination to Executive.  As used in
this Agreement, the term "Cause" shall include but not necessarily be limited to
(i) conviction of, or plea of nolo  contendere to, a felony or a crime involving
moral  turpitude;  (ii)  engagement  in conduct which has the effect of bringing
disrepute to the Employer's  reputation or hold the Employer or the Executive up
to public ridicule;  (iii) fraud on or misappropriation of any funds or property
of the Employer,  any affiliate,  customer or vendor;  (iv) willful violation of
any law,  rule or  regulation  (other than minor  traffic  violations or similar
offenses); (v) personal dishonesty,  willful misconduct,  or breach of fiduciary
duty which involves personal profit;  (vi) gross incompetence in the performance
of the  Executive's  duties under this  Agreement;  (vii) willful  misconduct in
connection  with the  Executive's  duties or  willful  failure  to  perform  the
Executive's  responsibilities  in the  best  interests  of the  Employer;  (vii)
habitual  absenteeism or inattention to the Executive's duties; (ix) chronic use
of alcohol,  drugs or other similar  substances  (other than

                                       13
<PAGE>

pursuant to medical  prescriptions and under doctors'  supervision for treatment
of  legitimate  illnesses or  conditions)  which  affects the  Executive's  work
performance; (x) violation of any Employer rule, regulation, procedure or policy
which has, or may  reasonably be expected to have, a material  adverse effect on
the  Employer;  (xi)  engaging in  behavior  that would  constitute  grounds for
liability for harassment (as proscribed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission Guidelines or any other applicable state or local regulatory body) or
other  egregious  conduct that violates laws governing the  workplace;  or (xii)
material  breach of any material  provision of any  employment,  non-disclosure,
non-competition,  non-solicitation  or other similar  agreement  executed by the
Executive for the benefit of the Employer (including,  without limitation,  such
provisions  within this Agreement) or of any material  Employer  policy,  all as
determined by the Board of Directors,  which  determination  will be conclusive.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary,  employment may not be terminated for
Cause in the event that the Executive becomes permanently  disabled as set forth
in this Agreement or dies. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,  the
Employer  shall give the  Executive  written  notice  prior to  terminating  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause under any  circumstance  in which the conduct
constituting  Cause  is  reasonably  open  to  cure  (for  instance,  by  way of
illustration  only,  where the Cause does not  involve a  violation  of trust or
otherwise  adversely  affect the  relationship  between  the  Executive  and the
Employer on a  going-forward  basis or involve  commission  of an act, such as a
felony, or an unauthorized  disclosure of confidential material, or an act which
may constitute  illegal  harassment  under laws  governing the workplace,  which
can't be undone),  setting forth in reasonable  detail the nature of any alleged
breach and the conduct required to cure such breach. If, and only if, the nature
of the  breach is such  that the  breach is  reasonably  open to cure,  then the
Executive  shall have  fourteen  (14) days from the giving of such notice within
which to cure such breach.

                  3.1.4. Without Cause By Employer. Employer may, at its option,
terminate  Executive's  employment for any reason whatsoever (other than for the
other reasons set forth above in this Section 3.1) by giving  written  notice of
such termination to Executive, and Executive's employment shall terminate on the
later of the date the written  notice of such  termination  is given or the date
set forth in such written notice.

                  3.1.5.  For  Good  Reason  by  Executive.  Executive  may,  at
Executive's option, terminate Executive's employment for "Good Reason" by giving
written  notice of  termination to Employer in the event that there is a failure
of Employer  (or  successor  employer)  to promptly  pay  Executive's  salary or
additional  compensation or benefits hereunder in accordance with this Agreement
in any material respect. It shall also be considered Good Reason for termination
by  Executive  if, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined  below),  any
successor  employer  fails to fully  assume  Employer's  obligations  under this
Agreement.  For purposes, of this Agreement,  a "Change of Control",  shall mean
(i) the dissolution or liquidation of Employer,  or (ii) the consummation of any
merger  or  consolidation  of  Employer  other  than in a  transaction  in which
Employer is the surviving corporation or a majority of the board of directors of
the surviving  corporation were directors of Employer before such transaction or
are designated by the former shareholders of Employer,  or (iii) a sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the then-outstanding capital stock of
Employer  or a  sale  or  other  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all of
Employer's assets. Good Reason shall also include any requirement that Executive
move his principal  office to a location  outside the Research  Triangle area of
North Carolina.

                                       14
<PAGE>

                  3.1.6.  Without  Good  Reason  By  Executive.   Executive  may
terminate Executive's  employment for any reason (other than for Good Reason) by
giving written notice of such  termination to Employer.  Executive's  employment
shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date, following the date of the notice
of  termination,  upon which a suitable  replacement  for  Executive is found by
Employer or upon which Employer makes a  determination,  in its sole discretion,
that Executive's  duties shall be undertaken by other employees of Employer,  or
(ii)  sixty  (60) days after the date of  receipt  by  Employer  of the  written
notice.

            3.2.  Certain  Obligations  of  Employer  Following  Termination  of
Executive's  Employment.  Following the  termination of  Executive's  employment
under the  circumstances  described  below,  Employer  will pay to  Executive in
accordance with its regular  payroll  practices the following  compensation  and
provide the following benefits:

                  3.2.1.  Death;  Disability.  In  the  event  that  Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of Executive's death or Disability, Executive
or Executive's estate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the following:

                  (i) that portion of any unpaid Base Salary up to and including
the date of such  termination  and any  accrued  but unused  vacation  up to and
including the date of such termination (the "Accrued Amount");

                  (ii) any accrued but unpaid Annual Bonus for any year prior to
the year in which such termination occurred ("Prior Annual Bonuses");

                  (iii) any unreimbursed business expenses incurred prior to the
date of such termination ("Expense Reimbursement");

                  (iv) all  benefits  generally  available  under  the  employee
benefit  plans,  and the policies  and  practices  of  Employer,  determined  in
accordance with the applicable terms and provisions of such plans,  policies and
practices,  in each  case,  as  accrued  to the  date of  termination  ("Accrued
Benefits")  or  otherwise  payable  as a  consequence  of  Executive's  death or
Disability; and

                  (v) the right to exercise all options that are fully vested as
of the date of such termination for the remainder of the term of such options as
fully set forth in the applicable grant agreement.

                  3.2.2.   Without  Cause  by  Employer;   For  Good  Reason  by
Executive.  In the event that  Executive's  employment is terminated by Employer
pursuant to Section  3.1.4  hereof or by  Executive  pursuant  to Section  3.1.5
hereof, Executive shall be entitled to the following:

                  (i)  continuing  payments of then  current Base Salary for the
following period (each such period as applicable, the "Severance Period"):

                                       15
<PAGE>

                        (a) if  such  termination  occurs  prior  to  the  first
                        anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  for  the  period
                        beginning on the date of such  termination and ending on
                        the second anniversary of the Effective Date, or

                        (b) if such  termination  occurs  on or after  the first
                        anniversary  of the Effective  Date, for the twelve (12)
                        month period following such termination;

and

                  (ii) continuing  coverage under  Employer's  employee  benefit
plans  during the  Severance  Period or if earlier,  until  Executive is covered
under the employee benefit plans of another employer;

                  (iii)  the  Accrued  Amount,  Prior  Annual  Bonuses,  Expense
Reimbursement and Accrued Benefits; and

                  (iv) any unvested portion of any options previously granted to
Executive  that is  scheduled  to vest during the  Severance  Period  shall vest
immediately  as of the date of such  termination  and  Executive  shall have the
right to  exercise  all  options  that are  fully  vested as of the date of such
termination  (including,  those  vested  by  acceleration  on the  date  of such
termination) for the remainder of the term of such options as fully set forth in
the applicable grant agreement.

                  3.2.3.  Termination  by  Executive  Without  Good Reason or by
Employer  for  Cause.  In the event  Executive's  employment  is  terminated  by
Executive  pursuant  to Section  3.1.6 or Section  3.1.7  hereof or by  Employer
pursuant to Section  3.1.3  hereof,  Executive  shall be entitled to the Accrued
Amount, Expense Reimbursement and Accrued Benefits.

                  3.2.4.  Termination on the Third  Anniversary of the Effective
Date. In the event  Executive's  employment is terminated upon the expiration of
this Agreement on the third  anniversary of the Effective Date,  Executive shall
not be entitled to any  compensation,  benefits or severance of any kind, except
as required by law.

            3.3.  Nature of  Payments.  All  amounts to be paid by  Employer  to
Executive  pursuant  to this  Section  3 are  considered  by the  parties  to be
severance  payments.  In the event such  payments are treated as damages,  it is
expressly  acknowledged by the parties that damages to Executive for termination
of  employment  would be  difficult  to  ascertain  and the  above  amounts  are
reasonable estimates thereof.

            3.4. Release.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither the
Executive  nor  the  Executive's   estate  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  any
compensation,  reimbursement or benefits upon  termination of employment  (other
than as required by law) unless the Executive or the Executive's  estate, as the
case may be, executes and delivers to the Employer  promptly after termination a
written release, in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to the Employer,
by which the Executive and the Executive's  estate, as the case may be, releases
the Employer from any obligations and liabilities of any type whatsoever related
to  Executive's  employment  under this  Agreement,  except  for the  Employer's
obligations  with respect to Section 3.2 of this Agreement,  which release shall
not affect the  Executive's  estate's  right,  if any, to  indemnification  with
respect to, or  insurance  in respect of, any actions  taken within the scope of
the  Executive's  employment,  or the  Executive's or the  Executive's  estate's
rights in respect of the  Executive's  vested  securities.  The  parties  hereto
acknowledge  that the  compensation,  reimbursement  and benefits to be provided
under Section 3.2 are to be provided in  consideration  for the  above-specified
release,  as well as for Executive's  agreement to be bound by the provisions of
Section 3.5 and Section 4.

            3.5. Other Provisions Applicable to Termination of Employment.

                  (1) At any time after notice to terminate  this  Agreement has
            been served or received by the Employer, the Employer, without being
            deemed in breach of this Agreement or being deemed to be taken steps
            which would  constitute  grounds for a different kind of termination
            under this Agreement,  may require the Executive to do the following
            during the applicable notice period concluding on the effective date
            of termination of employment under this Agreement:

                        (i) work in a capacity  consistent  with the Executive's
                  then  applicable  position and status other than that in which
                  the  Executive is employed  under this  Agreement  but without
                  affecting the Executive's  fixed salary,  including  benefits;
                  and

                        (ii) remain away from work and,  although the  Executive
                  will continue to receive the  Executive's  salary and benefits
                  provided for under this Agreement during such period,  and the
                  Employer will not be obliged to provide the Executive with any
                  work  although the Employer  may, in its absolute  discretion,
                  assign to the Executive during this period, from time to time,
                  such  appropriate  tasks or  projects as may be carried out by
                  the Executive away from the Employer's offices.

                  (2) Upon termination of the Executive's  employment under this
            Agreement, the Executive shall do the following:

                        (i)  forthwith  surrender  to  the  Employer,   in  good
                  condition and working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted),
                  all Employer property in the Executive's possession including,
                  without limitation,  all books, papers and other documents (of
                  whatever  nature  and  in  whatever  media)  belonging  to the
                  Employer or its  subsidiary or associated  company or relating
                  to  the  business  of  the  Employer  or  its   subsidiary  or
                  associated companies;

                        (ii) if the  Executive  is a director of the Employer or
                  of any subsidiary or associated  company,  or if the Executive
                  is an officer of any subsidiary or any associated company, and
                  is so  requested  by the  Employer,  resign as an  officer  or
                  director, as the case may be, within forty-eight (48) hours of
                  being so requested  and,  should the  Executive  fail to do so
                  within  forty-eight  (48)  hours of being  so  requested,  the
                  Executive  irrevocably  authorizes  the Employer to appoint an
                  agent in the Executive's name and on the Executive's behalf to
                  execute  and  deliver  any  documents  and to take any and all
                  actions  reasonably  deemed by the Employer to be necessary or
                  appropriate  to  give  effect  to such  resignation(s)  by the
                  Executive; and

                                       17
<PAGE>

                        (iii)  immediately  repay all outstanding debts or loans
                  due  to the  Employer  and/or  any  subsidiary  or  associated
                  company, the Employer being expressly authorized, for purposes
                  of clarity, to deduct the same from any wages of the Executive
                  a sum in  repayment  of all or any part of any  such  debts or
                  loans.

      4. Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation; Non-Compete.

            4.1.  Confidential  and Proprietary  Information;  Non-Solicitation.
Executive's  employment  by  Employer  is subject  to  Executive  executing  the
Proprietary Rights and  Confidentiality  Agreement annexed hereto as Schedule 2.
Such agreement shall be deemed, upon execution, to be incorporated in and a part
of this Agreement.

            4.2.  Executive  acknowledges  and agrees that (a) Employer  will be
irreparably  injured in the event of a breach by Executive of any of Executive's
obligations  under  Section 4.1;  (b)  monetary  damages will not be an adequate
remedy for any such breach; (c) in the event of any such breach Employer will be
entitled to injunctive relief as a matter of right and without posting a bond or
other security, in addition to any other remedy which it may have, and Executive
shall not oppose such injunctive relief based upon the extent of the harm or the
adequacy of monetary damages.

            4.3. Non-competition and Non-solicitation.

            (a) The Executive agrees and  acknowledges  that, in connection with
the  Executive's  employment  with the Employer,  the Executive will be provided
with access to and become familiar with confidential and proprietary information
and trade secrets belonging to the Employer.  Executive further acknowledges and
agrees  that,  given the nature of this  information  and trade  secrets,  it is
likely that such  information  and trade  secrets  would  inevitably  be used or
revealed,  either  directly or indirectly,  in any subsequent  employment with a
competitor  of the  Employer in any  position  comparable  to the  position  the
Executive  holds  with  the  Employer  under  this  Agreement.  Accordingly,  in
consideration of the Executive's  employment with the Employer  pursuant to this
Agreement,  and other good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, Executive agrees that, while the Executive is in the employ
of the Employer and for a period equal to the greater of the period during which
the Executive  receives any severance  pursuant to this  Agreement,  if any, and
Twelve (12) months after the  termination  of the  Executive's  employment,  the
Executive  shall not,  either on the  Executive's own behalf or on behalf of any
third  party,  except on  behalf  of the  Employer  or,  with the prior  written
agreement of the Employer (not to be unreasonably  withheld) or any affiliate of
the Employer, directly or indirectly:

                                       18
<PAGE>

                  (1) Other than through the  Executive's  ownership of stock of
the Employer,  directly or indirectly,  own,  manage,  operate,  join,  control,
finance or participate  in the ownership,  management,  operation,  control,  or
financing of, or be connected as a proprietor,  partner,  stockholder,  officer,
director,  principal, agent,  representative,  joint venturer, investor, lender,
consultant or otherwise with, or use or permit the  Executive's  name to be used
in connection with, any business or enterprise engaged directly or indirectly in
competition with the Business Conducted by the Employer (as hereinafter defined)
at any time  during  such  period,  and any other  business  ("Other  Business")
engaged in by the Employer that Executive is or has been directly  involved with
during the Twelve (12) month period  immediately  preceding  termination  of the
Executive's employment.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Business Conducted
by the Employer" shall mean the discovery, clinical or pre-clinical development,
sale  and/or  manufacture  of drugs  or drug  candidates  that  are  known to be
pharmacologically  active  at the  delta  and/or  mu cell  receptor(s),  and the
acquisition, licensing, development,  manufacturing,  marketing and distribution
of drugs and treatments for such other  conditions as the Employer is engaged in
addressing during the Twelve (12) month period immediately preceding termination
of the  Executive's  employment.  The  foregoing,  however,  shall  not  prevent
Executive from performing  services for a business engaged in the  biotechnology
or  biopharmaceutical  businesses  generally which is not  competitive  with the
Employer,  or for a competitive  business if such  competitive  business is also
engaged in lines of  business  which do not  compete  with the  Employer  and if
Executive's  services  are  restricted  to  employment  in such  other  lines of
business.  It is  recognized by the Executive and the Employer that the Business
Conducted  by the  Employer  is and is  expected  to  continue  to be  conducted
throughout  the United States and the world,  and that more narrow  geographical
limitations   of  any  nature  on  this   non-competition   covenant   (and  the
non-solicitation  provisions  set  forth  in  clauses  (2)  and (3)  below)  are
therefore not appropriate.  The foregoing  restriction shall not be construed to
prohibit the ownership by Executive as a passive investment of not more than one
percent  (1%) percent of any class of  securities  of any  corporation  which is
engaged  in any  of the  foregoing  businesses  having  a  class  of  securities
registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                  (2) Attempt in any manner to solicit from a current  client or
customer of the Employer at the time of the Executive's termination, business of
the type  performed by the Employer or to persuade any client of the Employer to
cease to do  business  or change  the  nature of the  business  or to reduce the
amount of  business  which any such  client  has  customarily  done or  actively
contemplates doing with the Employer; or

                  (3)  Recruit,  solicit  or induce,  or attempt to induce,  any
person  or  entity  which,  at the time of the  termination  of the  Executive's
employment  or at any time  during the Twelve  (12) month  period  prior to such
termination was an employee of the Employer or its affiliates, to terminate such
employee's employment with, or otherwise cease such employee's relationship with
the Employer or its affiliates.  As used in this Agreement,  an affiliate of the
Employer is any person or entity that,  directly or  indirectly,  through one or
more intermediaries,  controls,  or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the Employer.

            (b) The parties  agree that the relevant  public  policy  aspects of
covenants  not to compete  have been  discussed,  and that every effort has been
made to limit the  restrictions  placed  upon the  Executive  to those  that are
reasonable  and  necessary  to  protect  the  Employer's  legitimate  interests.
Executive acknowledges that, based upon the Executive's  education,  experience,
and training,  this  non-compete  provision  will not prevent the Executive from
earning a livelihood and supporting  himself and the  Executive's  family during
the relevant time period.

                                       19
<PAGE>

            (c) If any  restriction  set  forth in  Section  4.3 is found by any
court of competent  jurisdiction to be unenforceable  because it extends for too
long a period  of time or over too  great a range of  activities  or  geographic
area, it shall be interpreted  to extend over the maximum period of time,  range
of activities or geographic areas as to which it may be enforceable.

            (d)  The  restrictions  contained  in  4.3  are  necessary  for  the
protection  of the business and goodwill of the Employer  and/or its  affiliates
and are  considered  by the Executive to be reasonable  for such  purposes.  The
Executive agrees that any material breach of Section 4.3 will cause the Employer
and/or its affiliates  substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore,  in the
event of any such  breach,  in  addition  to such  other  remedies  which may be
available,  the Employer shall have the right to seek specific  performance  and
injunctive relief.

            (e) The  provisions  of Section  4.3 shall  survive  termination  or
expiration of this Agreement.

            (f) EXECUTIVE HAS READ AND  CAREFULLY  CONSIDERED  THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT,  HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT  EXECUTIVE'S OWN LEGAL COUNSEL TO
ADVISE EXECUTIVE REGARDING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EXECUTIVE NOW AGREES
THAT THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT  ARE FAIR AND  REASONABLE  AND ARE  REASONABLY
REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYER.  EXECUTIVE  FURTHER
AGREES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE
ABILITY OF EXECUTIVE TO SECURE  EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE
LIVING.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be enforceable  notwithstanding
the existence of any claim or cause of action of Executive  against the Employer
whether  predicated on this  Agreement or otherwise.  Failure of the Employer to
enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the conditions or covenants
of this  Agreement  shall not be construed as a waiver of such  provisions or of
the right of the  Employer to enforce  subsequent  breaches of the same or other
conditions and covenants,  unless such permanent waiver is provided to Executive
in writing and signed by the  President  of the Employer or, if Executive is the
President  of the  Employer,  such writing is to be signed by the officer of the
Employer designated for such purpose by the Board of Directors.

            (g)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein which may be construed to the
contrary,  Executive shall be free to use and employ Executive's general skills,
know-how and expertise,  and to use, disclose and employ any generalized  ideas,
concepts,  know-how,  methods, techniques or skills gained or learned during the
course of providing the services  hereunder,  so long as Executive  acquires and
applies this  information  without  violating the terms of this Paragraph 4.3 or
the Proprietary Rights and  Confidentiality  Agreement executed and delivered by
the Executive to the Employer in connection herewith.

                                       20
<PAGE>

            (h) The term of this non-competition covenant shall be tolled during
any period of actual  competition or breach of this Section 4.3 by the Executive
and/or any period of litigation to enforce  Executive's  obligations  under this
Agreement.

      5. Indemnification. Executive shall be covered by the Employer's directors
and officers liability insurance policy, and errors and omissions  coverage,  to
the same  extent  such  coverage is  generally  provided by the  Employer to its
directors  and officers and to the fullest  extent  permitted by such  insurance
policies. In addition,  the Employer shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless
from all liability to the fullest extent permitted by the Employer's  bylaws and
applicable law.

      6. Miscellaneous Provisions.

            6.1.  Severability.  If in any  jurisdiction  any term or  provision
hereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) the remaining terms and
provisions   hereof   shall  be   unimpaired,   (b)  any  such   invalidity   or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other  jurisdiction,  and (c) the invalid or
unenforceable  term or provision  shall, for purposes of such  jurisdiction,  be
deemed  replaced by a term or provision that is valid and  enforceable  and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or  unenforceable  term
or provision.

            6.2.  Execution in  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
one or more  counterparts,  and by the  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to be an original  but all of which
taken together  shall  constitute one and the same agreement (and all signatures
need not  appear  on any one  counterpart),  and  this  Agreement  shall  become
effective when one or more  counterparts  has been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to each of the other parties hereto.

            6.3.   Notices.   All   notices,   requests,   demands   and   other

the Company is engaged in  addressing  during the  Employee's  employment by the
Company.  Confidential Information also includes any information described above
which the Company  obtains  from another  party and which the Company  treats as
proprietary or designates as Confidential  Information,  whether or not owned or
developed  by the  Company,  including  without  limitation,  information  of or
concerning  the Company's  clients,  partners,  financial  investors or business
collaborators.  The  failure of the  Company to mark any of the  above-described

            For the purposes of this Agreement,  "Inventions"  shall mean ideas,
designs, creations, concepts, techniques, inventions, improvements, discoveries,
and works of  authorship,  whether or not patentable or protectable by copyright
or patent,  whether or not fixed in a tangible  medium of expression and whether
or not reduced to practice,  including but not limited to the nature and results
of research and development activities,  processes,  formulae, devices, designs,
processes,  computer  programs,  and  methods,  together  with any  improvements
thereon or thereto,  derivative  works or applications  derived  therefrom,  and
know-how related thereto.

            Information  publicly known that is generally  employed by the trade
at or after the time Employee first learns of such information  (other than as a
result of a breach by  Employee  of any duty owed to,  or  agreement  with,  the
Company),  or generic information or knowledge which Employee would have learned
in the course of similar  employment or work elsewhere in the trade shall not be
deemed part of the Confidential Information.


<PAGE>


      2.  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information.  Employee  agrees  that
Employee  has a fiduciary  duty to the Company and that  Employee  shall hold in
confidence  and  shall  not,  except  in the  course  of  performing  Employee's
employment obligations or pursuant to written authorization from the Company, at
any  time  during  or  for  ten  (10)  years  after  termination  of  Employee's
relationship  with the  Company  (a)  directly  or  indirectly  reveal,  report,
publish,  disclose or transfer the Confidential  Information or any part thereof
to any person or entity;  (b) directly or  indirectly  use, or permit the use of
any of the  Confidential  Information  or any part thereof for any purpose other
than for the benefit of the Company;  (c) assist any person or entity other than
the Company to secure any benefit from the Confidential  Information or any part
thereof or (d) solicit (on  Employee's  behalf or on behalf of any third  party)
any  employee of the Company for the purpose of  providing  services or products
which Employee is prohibited from providing hereunder.

      3.  Ownership of  Confidential  Information  and Work  Product.  Except as
limited by this Paragraph, Employee agrees that all Confidential Information and
all other work  product of any type or nature  created by Employee or  resulting
from  work  performed  by  Employee  for the  Company,  or using  the  Company's
facilities,  equipment,  supplies or other property, or related to the Company's
Business,  even if not Confidential  Information (such Confidential  Information
and work product being defined as "Work  Product"),  shall belong to the Company
exclusively and without any additional compensation to Employee. Employee agrees
that any original  copyrightable Work Product shall be considered as "works made
for hire," and that the  Company  shall be deemed the author  thereof,  provided
that to the extent such Work Product is determined not to constitute "works made
for hire" as a matter of law, Employee hereby irrevocably  assigns and transfers
to the Company all rights in and to such Work Product.

                                       2
<PAGE>

      The Company's ownership right to such Work Product shall extend regardless
of the hours during which or facilities at which the Work Product is made or the
resources or ownership of resources used in making it; provided however that the
assignment  of  rights  shall  not  apply to  creations  developed  entirely  on
Employee's own time without using the Company's facilities,  equipment, supplies
or other property,  Confidential Information or Work Product,  provided that the
creations do not (a) relate to the Company's  Business or actual or demonstrably
anticipated  research or  development,  or (b) result from any work performed by
Employee for the Company.

            Upon request  Employee will execute any instrument  required to vest
in the Company  complete  title and ownership to all Work Product,  and will, at
the request and expense of the  Company,  execute any  instruments  necessary to
obtain legal protection in the United States and foreign  countries for all Work
Product  and for the purpose of vesting  title  thereto in the  Company,  or its
nominee, all without any additional  compensation of any kind to Employee.  Only
if the Company  executes a written  statement  that it does not desire to obtain
protection for a particular Invention or copyrightable creation is Employee free
to obtain  protection  in  Employee's  own name and at  Employee's  own expense;
provided,  however,  that the  Company  shall have a  royalty-free  nonexclusive
irrevocable license under any patent or copyright so obtained by Employee.

            4.  Disclosure  to the  Company.  Upon  the  conception  of any Work
Product by Employee  (either solely or in  conjunction  with others) and without
waiting to perfect or complete it, Employee  promises and agrees  immediately to
fully disclose to the President and Chief Executive  Officer or other applicable
officer of the Company designated by the Board of Directors of the Company,  and
to no one else,  and  thereafter  to treat the Work  Product as the property and
secret of the  Company.  This shall  include  Work  Product  made,  conceived or
reduced to practice after the term of Employee's  employment but which belong to
the Company  pursuant to  Paragraphs 3 and 9. Upon request  Employee will reduce
any concept in the Work Product to writing and deliver all copies of the writing
to the President of the Company, or if Employee is the President of the Company,
such copies shall be  delivered  to such other  officer of the Company as may be
designated  by the Board of Directors of the Company.  These  obligations  shall
continue  beyond the  termination  of  employment  with  respect to Work Product
conceived or made during the period of employment.

      5.  Collaboration.  Employee  warrants  that  Employee  will  disclose the
participation  of any other  person in any of  Employee's  work for the Company.
Absent such  disclosure,  Employee  warrants that all work performed by Employee
will be Employee's own and that no other person shall have any right,  title, or
interest in any work submitted to the Company.

      6. Records.  Employee agrees that Employee will keep and maintain adequate
and current written records of all Work Product created by Employee. All written
records  relating  to any Work  Product,  whether  in the form of  notes,  data,
reference materials, sketches, drawings, memoranda, correspondence,  blueprints,
manuals, letters, notebooks,  reports, flowcharts,  programs,  proposals, or any
other form,  and whether in written,  electronic or other media,  concerning the
Company's Business or incorporating or reflecting any of the Work Product, shall
be and remain the  property of and  available  to the Company at all times,  and
shall be  delivered  to the  Company  on demand  or upon  Employee  leaving  the
Company's service.  The Company may, at any time and without notice to Employee,
take  possession  of  such  records  regardless  of  their  location,  including
Employee's  files,  desk,  computer  or other  areas  under the  control  of the
Company.

                                       3
<PAGE>

      7. Assistance  After  Employment.  Employee agrees that if,  subsequent to
Employee's  employment  by the Company,  his  assistance  is needed in regard to
securing,  defending,  or enforcing any patent or copyright of which Employee is
an inventor,  co-inventor,  author or co-author Employee shall provide requested
assistance and the Company shall pay reasonable  compensation  for his time at a
rate to be agreed  upon but not higher than 150% of the last salary rate paid to
Employee by the Company during his employment,  together with full reimbursement
of reasonable and necessary directly-related expenses.

      8. Third-Party  Obligations.  Employee  acknowledges that the Company from
time to  time  may  have  agreements  with  other  person  or  entities  or with
government or other  agencies that impose  obligations  or  restrictions  on the
Company regarding Inventions,  Confidential  Information or Work Product created
by Employee or the Company  during the course of work  thereunder,  or regarding
the  confidential  nature of the work or  confidential  information of the third
party disclosed during or used as part of such work. Employee agrees to be bound
by all such  obligations and  restrictions  and to take all action  necessary to
discharge the obligations of the Company thereunder.

      9.  Warranty  by  Employee.  Employee  represents  and  warrants  that his
performance of all terms under this Agreement does not result in a breach of any
duty owed by Employee to another,  under  contract or otherwise,  or violate any
confidence of another.  Employee agrees not to disclose to the Company or induce
the Company to use any confidential or proprietary  information belonging to any
of the Employee's previous employers or others.  Employee warrants that Employee
has  executed  no  prior   noncompetition,   nondisclosure  or   confidentiality
agreements  that would in any way  interfere  with his work for or employment by
the Company.  Employee  represents and warrants that Exhibit A attached  hereto,
entitled  "List of Work  Product," is a true and complete list of all creations,
if any,  whether or not  patented or  copyrighted  and whether or not reduced to
practice,  made by Employee prior to his employment with the Company,  and which
therefore are not subject to the provisions of Paragraph 3;  provided,  however,
that any improvements, whether or not patentable or reduced to practice, made to
or on, or any  derivative  work made from,  any of the listed  confidential  and
propriety information after Employee's commencement of employment by the Company
are subject to the terms of Paragraph 3.

            Employee  agrees to notify the  Company in writing  before  Employee
makes any  disclosure  to or performs  any work on behalf of the  Company  which
appears to threaten or conflict with any  proprietary  right Employee  claims in
any Work  Product and in the event of  Employee's  failure to give such  notice,
Employee  shall make no claim  against the Company with respect to any such Work
Product.

                                       4
<PAGE>

      10. Exit Interview.  Employee  agrees that upon  termination of Employee's
employment for any reason,  Employee shall participate in an exit interview with
Company  personnel.  At or prior to the time of this  interview  Employee  shall
deliver to the Company all notes, data, reference materials, sketches, drawings,
memoranda,  correspondence,  manuals,  letters,  notebooks,  reports,  programs,
proposals,  or any other  documents,  whether in  written,  electronic  or other
media,  concerning the Company's  Business or incorporating or reflecting any of
the  Confidential  Information  or Work  Product.  Employee  agrees  that,  upon
request, Employee will execute a sworn statement that Employee has complied with
the terms of this  Paragraph,  and that should  Employee  fail to execute such a
statement  the Company may  withhold any and all amounts due to Employee for any
reason, except minimum compensation required by law.

      11. Extraordinary Relief.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
prohibiting the Company from pursuing all remedies  available to the Company for
breach of this  Agreement.  Employee  recognizes  and agrees that because of the
unique nature of the  Confidential  Information and the competitive  position of
the Company his breach of this  Agreement will  irreparably  injure the Company,
for which the Company could not  adequately be  compensated  by remedies at law.
Should  Employee  at any time  reveal or use for the  benefit  of other than the
Company  or  threaten  to so  reveal  or use  any  Confidential  Information  in
violation  of  Paragraph  2, the  Company  shall be  entitled  to an  injunction
restraining Employee from doing or continuing to do or performing any such acts,
and  Employee  hereby  consents  to the  issuance  of  such  injunction  against
Employee.  Employee  further  agrees  to waive  any  bond or  proof  of  damages
requirement that may arise if the Company is forced to seek injunctive relief to
enforce the terms of this Agreement.

      12. Accounting for Profits; Indemnification. Employee covenants and agrees
that if Employee shall violate any of Employee's  covenants or agreements  under
this Agreement,  the Company shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of
all profits,  compensation,  royalties,  commissions,  remunerations or benefits
which  Employee  directly  or  indirectly  shall have  realized  or may  realize
relating  to,  growing out of or in  connection  with any such  violation;  such
remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or
other rights or remedies to which the Company is or may be entitled at law or in
equity or otherwise  under this  Agreement.  Employee  hereby  agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold  harmless the Company  against and in respect of: (i) any and
all losses and damages  resulting from,  relating or incident to, or arising out
of any  misrepresentation  or breach by  Employee of any  warranty,  covenant or
agreement  made or  contained in this  Agreement;  and (ii) any and all actions,
suits,  proceedings,  claims, demands,  judgments,  payments, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incident to the foregoing.

      13. Successor Employers. Employee hereby authorizes the Company to provide
a copy  of this  Agreement,  including  any  Exhibits,  to any  and  all  future
employers,  and to notify any and all future  employers that the Company intends
to exercise its legal rights arising out of or in conjunction with the Agreement
and/or any breach or any inducement of breach of it.

                                       5
<PAGE>

      14.  Reasonableness  and  Enforceability.  EMPLOYEE HAS READ AND CAREFULLY
CONSIDERED  THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT,  HAS HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY  TO  CONTACT
EMPLOYEE'S  OWN LEGAL  COUNSEL TO ADVISE  EMPLOYEE  REGARDING  THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, AND EMPLOYEE NOW AGREES THAT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE FAIR AND
REASONABLE AND ARE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEREST OF THE
COMPANY.  EMPLOYEE  FURTHER AGREES THAT THE  RESTRICTIONS  AND COVENANTS OF THIS
AGREEMENT WILL NOT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYEE TO SECURE  EMPLOYMENT SO AS TO
BE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE  LIVING.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
enforceable  notwithstanding  the  existence  of any claim or cause of action of
Employee against the Company whether  predicated on this Agreement or otherwise.
Failure  of the  Company to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of
the conditions or covenants of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver
of such provisions or of the right of the Company to enforce subsequent breaches
of the same or other  conditions and covenants,  unless such permanent waiver is
provided to Employee in writing and signed by the  President  of the Company or,
if Employee is the President of the Company, such writing is to be signed by the
Board of Directors of the Company.

      15.  Reformation/Severability  of  Agreement.  If any  provision  of  this
Agreement   shall  for  any  reason  be  adjudged  by  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction or arbiter to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable,  such
judgment shall not affect,  impair or invalidate the remainder of this Agreement
but shall be  confined  in its  operation  to the  provision  of this  Agreement
directly  involved in the  controversy  in which such  judgment  shall have been
rendered. The invalid or unenforceable  provision shall be reformed so that each
party shall have the obligation to perform reasonably  alternatively to give the
other  party  the  benefit  of  its  bargain.   In  the  event  the  invalid  or
unenforceable provision cannot be reformed, the other provisions or applications
of this Agreement shall be given full effect,  and the invalid or  unenforceable
provision shall be deemed struck.

      16.  Construction  of Terms.  Any reference  herein to the masculine shall
include the  feminine or neuter,  and any  reference  herein to the  singular or
plural may be construed as plural or singular wherever the context requires.

      17.  Successor and Assigns.  This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Company,  its successors and assigns,  including without
limitation  any  entity  which  may  acquire  all  or  substantially  all of the
Company's  assets and business or into which the Company may be  consolidated or
merged,  and the  Employee,  his  heirs,  executors,  administrators  and  legal
representatives.  Employee  may not  assign  any of his  obligations  under this
Agreement.

      18.  Governing  Law and Venue.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed by and
construed  in  accordance  with  the laws of New York  applicable  to  contracts
between  residents of New York which are wholly  executed  and  performed in New
York. Any lawsuit brought under the terms of this Agreement shall have exclusive
venue in the state and federal  courts of New York County,  New York;  provided,
however,  that with respect to any proceeding for injunctive  relief the Company
may, at its option,  bring the proceeding  before a court where Employee resides
at the time of such proceeding.

      19. Merger.  This Agreement  constitutes the entire Agreement  between the
parties with respect to the subject matter  hereof;  and supersedes and replaces
any oral or written  communications and any undertakings  otherwise made between
the parties relating to the subject matter. Except as specified in Paragraph 15,
no changes,  modifications,  or amendments  of any terms and  conditions of this
Agreement are valid or binding  unless agreed to in a writing signed by Employee

EXHIBIT 99.1

ENHANCE BIOTECH ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF MERGER WITH ARDENT PHARMACEUTICALS

NEW YORK, NY-- (PR  NEWSWIRE)--DECEMBER  20 2004--ENHANCE BIOTECH, INC. (OTC PK:
EBOI),  a specialty  pharmaceutical  company  developing a portfolio of products
focused on lifestyle drugs, and Ardent  Pharmaceuticals  Inc., a world leader in
discovering and developing delta receptor compounds,  announced today that their
previously  announced merger transaction has been consummated.  As a consequence
of the transaction,  Ardent is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enhance Biotech,
Inc. The new portfolio  offers a broad pipeline of products  under  development,
ranging from  pre-clinical  New Chemical  Entities  (NCE) through to later stage
products  addressing the potentially  large  lifestyle  market areas of urology,
dermatology and Central Nervous System (CNS). The management and scientific team
includes leading specialist scientists in the delta receptor area and management
talent with an  expertise  in  licensing  products  and driving them through the
regulatory  process  to market.  Combined  facilities  include  state-of-the-art
laboratory and development facilities for early stage chemistry and pharmacology
along with clinical  expertise.  Merger agreements provide that immediately upon
consummation  of the merger  transaction,  on a fully-diluted  basis,  Enhance's
pre-existing  stockholders own approximately fifty-five percent (55%) of Enhance
Biotech,  Inc., and former Ardent  shareholders own approximately  approximately
forty-five percent (45%) of Enhance Biotech, Inc.

Effective immediately,  Chris Every, Enhance Biotech's CEO, will continue as the
CEO, President and a member of the Board of Directors.  Dr. Ken Chang, Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Ardent,  has been appointed  President of
Asia Pacific  Operations  and Chief  Science  Officer of Enhance.  Phillip Wise,
Chief Financial Officer and VP Business Development of Ardent has been named the
Chief Financial Officer of Enhance. Sam McCormick,  the Chief Science Officer of
Enhance has  assumed  the  position  of Vice  President  Science of Europe.  The
Company's  operational  headquarters  is based in the  North  Carolina  Research
Triangle with corporate offices in New York and London.

Chris Every commented,  "This merger opens an exciting future for our employees,
shareholders and future  customers.  The closing of this merger  transaction was
the  realization  of the hard work and  collaborative  efforts of employees from
both  organizations.   The  success  of  the  negotiation  process,   which  was
facilitated  by independent  biotech  bankers  BIO-IB,  bodes well for effective
completion and cohesive  merging of the operations of the two  organizations  in
the immediate future.  Combined, our two companies have taken a significant step
toward  fulfilling  the  vision of  becoming  a leader in  lifestyle,  specialty
pharmaceuticals  offering  a broad  portfolio  of  products  to the  market in a
relatively short period of time."

About Enhance Biotech

Enhance  Biotech,  Inc.  is  a  specialty   pharmaceutical  company  focused  on
developing a product  portfolio in three key areas of the lifestyle drug market:
urology,  dermatology and CNS. Key conditions  addressed within the urology area
are  Urinary  Incontinence  and  Sexual  Dysfunction,  which  include  premature
ejaculation and male fertility,  while skincare  indications  include Cellulite,
Itch,  Anti-aging,  Periodontal  Disease and  Dermatological  Disorders  such as
Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis.  Within the CNS area, the Company is developing
compounds in  moderate-to-severe  Pain,  Parkinson's disease and Depression.  An
area for future  licensing  for which the Company  has  developed  compounds  is
Cardio-protection.  The  Company  has  developed  substantial  knowledge  of the
chemistry  and  pharmacology  of the delta  receptor,  including  a  library  of
approximately 1,000 compounds that demonstrate specific delta receptor activity.
This creates a valuable product portfolio in the lifestyle market, a market that
is forecast to grow to US $32 billion by 2008. The  pharmaceutical  industry has
invested  over $20  billion in R&D for  lifestyle  drugs over the last 10 years,
although  relatively few new products have as yet reached the market.  Enhance's
lead  development  products are intended to address  unmet needs in these global
blockbuster markets.  These products are generally in development stages ranging
from  pre-clinical  target compound  selection through to late Phase II. Enhance
has 18 employees and an extensive  research  facility based in North  Carolina's
Research  Triangle  Park  along  with  experienced   clinical   development  and
commercial  management.  For more  information on the Company,  please visit the
