The Board of Directors and Stockholder
Financial Guaranty Insurance Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Financial Guaranty Insurance
Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003, and the related statements of
income, stockholder's equity and cash flows for the periods from December 18,
2003 through December 31, 2003, and from January 1, 2003 through December 17,
2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Financial Guaranty Insurance
Company as of December 31, 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the periods from December 18, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and from

principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. Business and Organization

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (the "Company") is an wholly-owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation (the "Parent"). The Parent was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital"). The Company
provides financial guaranty insurance for public finance and structured finance
obligations. The Company began insuring public finance obligations in 1984 and
structured finance obligations in 1988. The Company's financial strength is
rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), "AAA" by Standard &
Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"),
and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch"). The Company is licensed to engage in
financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and, through a branch, in the United Kingdom.

On December 18, 2003, an investor group consisting of The PMI Group, Inc.
("PMI"), affiliates of the Blackstone Group L.P. ("Blackstone"), affiliates of
the Cypress Group L.L.C. ("Cypress") and affiliates of CIVC Partners L.P.
("CIVC"), collectively the "Investor Group", completed the acquisition (the
"Transaction") of FGIC Corporation from a subsidiary of GE Capital in a
transaction valued at approximately $2,200,000. At the closing of the
Transaction, the Investor Group, acting through an affiliate, paid GE Capital a
cash purchase price of approximately $1,600,000, which was funded by equity
investments by the Investor Group and borrowings of approximately $227,300 under
a bridge loan facility within an affiliate of Bank of America Corporation. The
bridge loan originally was to mature on December 16, 2004; however, the bridge
loan was repaid with the proceeds of the Senior Notes issued on January 12, 2004
(see Note 15). In addition, FGIC Corporation paid GE Capital approximately
$284,300 in pre-closing dividends and GE Capital retained 2,346 shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Senior Preferred Shares") with an aggregate
liquidation preference of $234,600 and approximately 5% of FGIC Corporation's
common stock. PMI is the largest stockholder of FGIC Corporation, owning
approximately 42% of its common stock at December 31, 2003. Blackstone, Cypress
and CIVC own approximately 23%, 23% and 7% of FGIC Corporation's common stock,
respectively, at December 31, 2003.

2. Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of GAAP,
which differs in certain respects from the accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by the New York Department of Insurance (the "Department") (see Note
4).

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company's significant accounting policies are as follows:

a. Investments

The Company classifies all of its fixed maturity securities as
available-for-sale, which is recorded on the trade date at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. Short-term
investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Bond discounts and premiums are amortized over the remaining term of the
securities. Realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are determined
based on the specific identification method.

Securities which have been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired are
reduced to realizable value, establishing a new cost basis, with a charge to
realized loss at such date.

b. Premium Revenue Recognition

Premiums are received either up-front or over time on an installment basis. The
premium collection method is determined at the time the policy is issued.
Up-front premiums are paid in full at the inception of the policy and are earned
over the period of risk based on total exposure outstanding at any point in
time. Installment premiums are collected periodically and premiums are reflected
in income pro rata over the period covered by the premium payment. Unearned
premiums represent the portion of premiums received that is

                                                                              8

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

applicable to future periods on policies in force. When an obligation insured by
the Company has been refunded prior to the end of the expected policy coverage
period, any remaining unearned premium is recognized at that time. A refunding
occurs when an insured obligation is repaid or fully defeased prior to stated
maturing. Ceded premiums are earned in a manner consistent with the underlying
policies.

c. Policy Acquisition Costs

Policy acquisition costs include only those expenses that relate directly to
premium production. Such costs include compensation of employees involved in
marketing, underwriting and policy issuance functions, rating agency fees, state
premium taxes and certain other expenses. In determining policy acquisition
costs, the Company must estimate and allocate the percentage of its costs and
expenses that are attributable to premium production, rather than to other
activities. Policy acquisition costs, net of ceding commission income on
premiums ceded to reinsurers, are deferred and amortized over the period in
which the related premiums are earned. Anticipated loss and loss adjustment
expenses and maintenance costs and net investment income are considered in
determining the recoverability of acquisition costs.

d. Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses includes principal and interest
and other payments due under insured risks at the balance sheet date for which,
in management's judgment, the likelihood of future loss is probable and for
which the expected losses can be reasonably estimated. Case reserves are
established for the net present value of estimated losses on particular insured
obligations. These reserves represent an estimate of the present value of the
anticipated shortfall, net of reinsurance, between (1) payments on insured
obligations plus anticipated loss adjustment expenses and (2) anticipated cash
flow from, and proceeds to be received on, sales of any collateral supporting
the obligation and/or other anticipated recoveries. As of December 31, 2003 and
2002, discounted case-basis loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were
$18,900 and $21,500, respectively. Loss and loss adjustment expenses included
amounts discounted at an approximate interest rate of 4.4% in 2003 and 3.4% in
2002. The amount of the discount at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $3,400 and
$4,000, respectively. The discount rate used is based upon the risk-free rate
for the average maturity of the applicable bond sector.

                                                                               9

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

In addition to case reserves, the Company establishes reserves to cover those
impaired credits on its credit watch list. These reserves are designed to
recognize the potential for claims on credits that have migrated to an impaired
level where there is an increased probability of default, but that are not
presently or imminently in payment default. The methodology for establishing and
calculating the watch list reserve relies on a categorization and assessment of
the probability of default, and loss severity given default, of the impaired
credits on the list. The reserve applies to the group of credits at various
stages of impairment, not each individual credit, as is the situation in a case
basis reserve. The watch list reserve is adjusted as necessary to reflect
changes in the loss expectation inherent in the group of impaired credits. As of
December 31, 2003, such reserves were $21,600. Prior to the Transaction, the
Company established similar reserves based upon an evaluation of the insured
portfolio in light of current economic conditions and other relevant factors. As
of December 31, 2002, such reserves were $26,400.

The reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses is based upon estimates and,
in management's opinion, the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are
adequate. However, actual results will likely differ from those estimates.

e. Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. These temporary differences relate principally to unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, premium revenue
recognition, deferred acquisition costs, discount on loss and loss adjustment
reserves and certain loss reserves, alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carry
forwards and profit commission. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Financial guaranty insurance companies are permitted to deduct from taxable
income, subject to certain limitations, amounts added to statutory contingency
reserves (see Note 4). The amounts deducted must be included in taxable income
upon their release from the reserves. The amounts deducted are allowed as
deductions from taxable income only to the extent that U.S. Government
non-interest bearing tax and loss bonds are purchased and held in an amount
equal to the tax benefit attributable to such deductions.

                                                                              10

f. Property and Equipment

Property and equipment consists of office furniture, fixtures, computer
equipment and software and leasehold improvements, which are reported at, cost
less accumulated depreciation. Office furniture and fixtures are depreciated
straight-line over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their
estimated service life or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Computer equipment and software are depreciated over three years. Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

g. Goodwill

Effective January 1, 2002, the FGIC Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142").
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but rather is tested for
impairment at least annually.

In accounting for the acquisition of FGIC Corporation by the Investor Group in
2003, the Company has applied purchase accounting as prescribed by Statement of
Financial accounting Standards No. 141 Business Combinations ("SFAS 141") and
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 54. Under this
accounting method, the purchase price has been pushed down into the accompanying
financial statements, with the difference between the purchase price and the sum
of the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less
liabilities assumed resulting in negative goodwill of $27,300 at December 18,
2003. In accordance with SFAS 141 the Company reduced the value assigned to
non-financial assets, the remaining negative goodwill of $13,852 was recorded as
an extraordinary gain in the consolidated statement of income. In 1989, when
FGIC Corporation was acquired by GE Capital, FGIC Corporation did not push down
the purchase price and related goodwill to the Company.

As a result of the purchase accounting effective on December 18, 2003, the basis
of the assets and liabilities has changed, which necessitates the presentation
of Predecessor Company and the Successor Company columns in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, Statements of Income, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows.

                                                                              11

h. Foreign Currency Translation

The Company has an established foreign branch in the United Kingdom and exposure
in France and determined that the functional currencies of these branches are
their local currencies. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these foreign
branches are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange existing at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 and revenues and expenses are translated at average
monthly exchange rates. The cumulative translation gain (loss) at December 31,
2003 and 2002 was $0 and $(2,729), respectively, net of tax expense (benefit) of
$0 and $(1,470), respectively, and is reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders' equity.

i. New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation Number 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"), which the Company
adopted on July 1, 2003. FIN 46's consolidation criteria are based upon analysis
of risks and rewards, not control, and represent a significant and complex
modification of previous accounting principles. FIN 46 represents an accounting
change not a change in the underlying economics associated with the
transactions, which may be affected by the Interpretation. FIN 46 clarifies the
consolidation criteria for certain entities in which equity investors do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have
sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 requires
variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if
the entities do not effectively disperse risk among parties involved. Variable
interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated. FIN
46 requires disclosures for entities that have either a primary or significant
variable interest in a variable interest entity.

As a part of its structured finance business, the Company insures debt
obligations or certificates issued by special purposes entities. At December 31,
2003, the Company had $1,021,000 of gross principal outstanding related to
insurance contracts issued to commercial paper conduits--variable interest
entities under FIN 46--which the Company does not believe requires consolidation
but which requires disclosure. With respect to the remainder of the municipal
finance and structured finance transactions insured, the Company has evaluated
the transactions, and does not believe any such transactions require
consolidation or disclosure under FIN 46.

                                                                              12

4. Statutory Accounting Practices

The financial statements are prepared on the basis of GAAP, which differs in
certain respects from accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the
Department. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
approved the codification project ("Codification") effective January 1, 2001 and
the Department adopted certain but not all provisions of Codification.

The following are the significant differences between the Company's
statutory-basis accounting practices and GAAP:

(a)    premiums are earned directly in proportion to the scheduled principal and
       interest payments rather than in proportion to the total exposure
       outstanding at any point in time under GAAP;

(b)    policy acquisition costs are charged to current operations as incurred
       rather than as related premiums are earned under GAAP;

(c)    a contingency reserve is computed on the basis of statutory requirements
       for the security of all policyholders, regardless of whether loss
       contingencies actually exist, whereas under GAAP, a reserve is
       established based on an ultimate estimate of exposure;

(d)    certain assets designated as nonadmitted assets are charged directly
       against surplus but are reflected as assets under GAAP, if recoverable;

(e)    deferred tax assets are limited to 1) the amount of federal income taxes
       paid in prior years that can be recovered through loss carry backs for
       existing temporary differences that reverse by the end of the subsequent
       calendar year, plus 2) the lesser of the remaining gross deferred tax
       assets expected to be realized within one year of the balance sheet date
       or 10% of capital and surplus excluding any net deferred tax assets, EDP
       equipment and operating software and any net positive goodwill, plus 3)
       the amount of remaining gross deferred tax assets that can be offset
       against existing gross deferred tax liabilities. The remaining deferred
       tax assets are non-admitted. Deferred taxes do not include amounts for
       state income taxes. Under GAAP, state income taxes are included in the
       computation of deferred taxes, a deferred tax asset is recorded for the
       amount of gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized in future
       years, and a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets
       not realizable.

                                                                              13

4.     Statutory Accounting Practices (continued)

(f)    purchases of tax and loss bonds are reflected as admitted assets; while
       under GAAP they are recorded as federal income tax payments;

(g)    all fixed income investments are carried at amortized cost rather than at
       fair value for securities classified as available-for-sale under GAAP;

(h)    profit commissions are recognized as received while under GAAP
       management's best estimate of the Company's ultimate recoverable is
       accrued; and

(i)    case reserves are discounted at the average investment portfolio yield
       for statutory purposes and at the risk-free rate under GAAP.

Statutory-basis surplus of the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was
$1,153,500 and $977,573, respectively. Statutory-basis net income (loss) for the
period from December 18, 2003 through December 31, 2003, from January 1, 2003
through December 17, 2003 and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was
($1,669), $180,091, $205,476 and $206,893, respectively.

5. Investments

Investments in fixed maturity securities carried at fair value of $3,900 as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were on deposit with various regulatory authorities

6. Income Taxes

For the period ending on the closing date of the Transaction, the Company files
its federal tax return as part of the consolidated return of GE Capital. Under
the tax sharing agreement with GE Capital, tax is allocated to the Company based
upon its respective contributions to consolidated net income. For the period
subsequent to the closing date of the sale transaction, the Company will become
eligible to file its own consolidated federal return.

                                                                              17

6. Income Taxes (continued)

The Company's effective federal income tax rate is less than the corporate tax
rate on ordinary income of 35%, primarily due to tax-exempt interest on
municipal investments.

The following is a reconciliation of federal income taxes computed at the
statutory rate and the provision for federal income taxes:

The Company's net operating loss carry forwards of $13,400 expire in 2023. Based
upon the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable
income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the
estimated reversal of future taxable temporary differences, the Company believes
it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible
differences and has not established a valuation allowance at December 31, 2003
and 2002.

6. Income Taxes (continued)

Total federal income tax payments during the period from December 18, 2003
through December 31, 2003, from January 1, 2003 through December 17, 2003 and
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $0, $156,800, $77,500 and
$38,300, respectively.

7. Reinsurance

Reinsurance is the commitment by one insurance company (the reinsurer) to
reimburse another insurance company (the ceding company) for a specified portion
of the insurance risks under policies insured by the ceding company in
consideration for a portion of the related premiums received. The ceding company
typically will receive a ceding commission from the reinsurer to cover costs of
producing business.

The Company uses reinsurance to increase its capacity to write insurance for
obligations of large, frequent issuers, to meet internal, rating agency or
regulatory single risk limits, to diversify risk and to reduce capital needs.
The Company currently arranges reinsurance on only a facultative (transaction by
transaction) basis. Prior to 2003, the Company also had treaty reinsurance
agreements that provided coverage for a specified portion of the exposure under
all qualifying policies issued during the term of the treaty.

The Company seeks to place reinsurance with financially strong reinsurance
companies since, as a primary insurer, the Company is required to fulfill all
its obligations to policyholders even in cases where reinsurers fail to perform
their obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company
regularly monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers. Under most of the
Company's reinsurance agreements, the Company has the right to reassume all the
exposure ceded to a reinsurer (and receive all the remaining unearned premiums
ceded) in the event of a significant ratings downgrade of the reinsurer or the
occurrence of certain other special cancellation events. In certain of these
cases, the Company also has the right to impose additional ceding commissions.

In recent years, a number of the Company's reinsurers have been downgraded by
the rating agencies, thereby reducing the financial benefits of using
reinsurance under the rating agency capital adequacy models because the Company
must allocate additional capital to the related reinsured exposure. The Company
still receives statutory credit for this reinsurance. In connection with such a
downgrade, the Company reassumed $6,300, $14,300, $2,600 and $3,200, of ceded
premiums for the period from December 18, 2003 through December 31, 2003, from
January 1, 2003 through December 17, 2003 and for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively, from the reinsurers.

                                                                             20

of credit and trust agreements in various amounts with various reinsurers
totaling $53,200 at December 31, 2003 that can be drawn on in the event of
default by the reinsurer.

8. Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses (continued)

During the period from January 1, 2003 through December 17, 2003, the overall
decrease in case reserves was driven by a reduction in reserves previously
established on several structured finance transactions of one particular issuer.
Certain transactions related to the issuer were identified as potential problem
credits in 2001 and 2000 and case reserves were established during those years.
In 2002, there was further adverse development on such transactions and a
determination was made by management that several other transactions related to
that issuer also required case reserves.

9. Related Party Transactions

The Company had various agreements with subsidiaries of General Electric Company
and GE Capital. These business transactions included certain payroll and office
expenses, investment fees pertaining to the management of the Company's
investment portfolio and telecommunication service charges. Approximately
$1,600, $2,200 and $1,200 in expenses were incurred in the period from January
1, 2003 through December 17, 2003 and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, related to such transactions and are reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

As part of the Transaction, the Company entered into a transitional services
agreement with GE Capital to provide certain administrative and support services
in exchange for certain scheduled fees during the 12 months following the date
of the agreement. Investment management services continue to be provided by GE
Capital. The Company plans to transfer investment management services by the end
of the first quarter of 2004 to Blackrock Financial Management, Inc. and
Wellington Management Company, LLP.

In connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into a capital lease
agreement with a subsidiary of GE Capital. The lease agreement covers leasehold
improvements made to the Company's headquarters as well as furniture and
fixtures, computer hardware and software used by the Company (see Note 13).

                                                                              22

9. Related Party Transactions (continued)

In connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into the $300,000 Soft
Capital Facility with GE Capital as lender and administrative agent. The Soft
Capital Facility, which replaced the capital support facility that the Company
previously had with GE Capital, has an initial term of eight years. The
commitment of GE Capital or any other lender which GE Capital may syndicate to
under the Soft Capital Facility can be extended for one-year terms at the
request of the Company and with the consent of such lender. During the term of
the Soft Capital Facility, the Company may borrow thereunder if the cumulative
losses (net of reinsurance and net of recoveries) it incurs with regard to its
public finance insured portfolio exceed certain predetermined amounts, which
amount initially is the greater of $500,000 and 3.6% of the Company's average
annual debt service on its public finance insured portfolio and escalates each
year during the term of the Soft Capital Facility. The amount that the Company
may borrow at any given time cannot exceed the lesser of such excess cumulative
loss and the unutilized commitments of the lender under the Soft Capital
Facility. Any repayment of amounts drawn under the Soft Capital Facility is
limited primarily to the amount of any recoveries of losses related to policy
obligations in the covered public finance insured portfolio. No amounts are
currently outstanding under this facility. The Soft Capital Facility replaced a
prior agreement with GE Capital which was cancelled on the date of the
Transaction. Under the terms of an agreement dated May 14, 1993 and renewed
through December 17, 2003, GE Capital had agreed to purchase common shares up to
an aggregate fair value of $300,000 in the event that a rating downgrade of the
Company and its subsidiary, FGIC, are imminent. In exchange for this commitment,
the Company paid an annual commitment fee of 0.60% of the then outstanding
commitment at each quarter end.

As part of the Transaction, GE Capital and the Company entered into a
reimbursement agreement, which covers losses incurred in excess of $5,000
related to several structured finance transactions of one particular issuer. The
agreement is subject to a maximum of $25,000.

The Company also insured certain nonmunicipal issues with GE Capital involvement
as sponsor of the insured securitization and/or servicer of the underlying
assets. For some of these issues, GE Capital also provides first loss protection
in the event of default. Gross premiums written on these issues amounted to $20
for the period from January 1, 2003 through December 18, 2003, $50 in 2002 and
$100 in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, par outstanding on these deals before
reinsurance was $35,000.

                                                                              23

9. Related Party Transactions (continued)

The Company insures bond issues and securities in trusts that were sponsored by
affiliates of GE (approximately 1% of gross premiums written) in 2003, 2002 and
2001.

As of December 31, 2003, receivable from related parties of $9,759 are due from
GE Capital and its affiliates for prepaid taxes.

10. Compensation Plans

Officers and other key employees of the Company participate in the incentive
compensation and deferred compensation plans. Expenses incurred by the Company
under compensation plans and bonuses amounted to $3,996, $10,087, $3,800 and
$2,700 for the period from December 18, 2003 through December 31, 2003, the
period from January 1, 2003 through December 17, 2003 and the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively and are reflected in the accompanying
financial statements. The increase in 2003 is driven by transaction related
costs which include retention bonuses and sign-on bonuses to new hires
post-acquisition.

11. Dividends

Under New York insurance law, the Company may pay a dividend to FGIC Corporation
only from earned surplus subject to the following limitations: (a) statutory
surplus after such dividend may not be less than the minimum required paid-in
capital, which was $72,500 in 2003 and 2002, and (b) dividends may not exceed
the lesser of 10% of its surplus or 100% of adjusted net investment income, as
defined by New York insurance law, for the twelve-month period ended on the
preceding December 31, without the prior approval of the New York State
Superintendent of Insurance. In connection with the Transaction, FGIC
Corporation agreed that no dividends will be paid by the Company until December
18, 2005, without prior approval of the New York State Insurance Department.

During the period from January 1, 2003 through December 17, 2003 and for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company declared and paid dividends
to FGIC Corporation of $284,300, $100,000 and $200,000, respectively. The
$284,300 and $200,000 in dividends declared in 2003 and 2001, respectively, were
approved by the New York State Superintendent of Insurance as extraordinary
dividends.

                                                                              24

12. Financial Instruments

   (a)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
        The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating fair values of financial instruments:

          Fixed Maturity Securities: Fair values for fixed maturity
          securities are based on quoted market prices, if available. If a
          quoted market price is not available, fair values are estimated
          using quoted market prices for similar securities. Fair value
          disclosure for fixed maturity securities are included in the
          consolidated balance sheets and in note 5.

          Short-Term Investments: Short-term investments are carried at cost,
          which approximates fair value.

          Cash, Accrued Investment Income, Prepaid Expenses and Other
          Assets, Receivable from Related Parties, Ceded Reinsurance
          Balances Payable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses and
          Payable for Securities Purchased: The carrying amounts of these
          items approximate their fair values.

        The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

12. Financial Instruments (continued)

              Financial Guaranties: The carrying value of the Company's
              financial guaranties is represented by the unearned premium
              reserve, net of deferred acquisition costs, loss and loss
              adjustment expense reserves and prepaid reinsurance premiums.
              Estimated fair values of these guaranties are based on an estimate
              of the balance that is necessary to bring the future returns for
              the Company's embedded book of business to a market return. The
              estimated fair values of such financial guaranties is $830,881
              compared to a carrying value of $824,595 as of December 31, 2003
              and is $581,764 compared to a carrying value of $521,721 as of
              December 31, 2002.

              As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the net present value of future
              installment premiums was $111,200 and $100,200, respectively,
              discounted at 5% at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

   (b)  Concentrations of Credit Risk
        The Company considers its role in providing insurance to be credit
        enhancement rather than credit substitution. The Company insures only
        those securities that, in its judgment, are of investment grade quality.
        The Company has established and maintains its own underwriting standards
        that are based on those aspects of credit that the Company deems
        important for the particular category of obligations considered for
        insurance. Credit criteria include economic and social trends, debt
        management, financial management and legal and administrative factors,
        the adequacy of anticipated cash flows, including the historical and
        expected performance of assets pledged for payment of securities under
        varying economic scenarios and underlying levels of protection such as
        insurance or over-collateralization.

        In connection with underwriting new issues, the Company sometimes
        requires, as a condition to insuring an issue, that collateral be
        pledged or, in some instances, that a third-party guaranty be provided
        for a term of the obligation insured by a party of acceptable credit
        quality obligated to make payment prior to any payment by the Company.
        The types and extent of collateral pledged varies, but may include
        residential and commercial mortgages, corporate debt, government debt
        and consumer receivables.

                                                                              26

1. Basis of Presentation

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (the "Company") is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation (the "Parent"). The Parent was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital"). The Company
provides financial guaranty insurance for public finance and structured
finance obligations. The Company began insuring public finance obligations in
1984 and structured finance obligations in 1988. The Company's financial
strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), "AAA"
by Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc. ("S&P"), and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch"). The Company is
licensed to engage in financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and, through a branch,
in the United Kingdom.

On December 18, 2003, an investor group consisting of The PMI Group, Inc.
("PMI"), affiliates of the Blackstone Group L.P. ("Blackstone"), affiliates of
the Cypress Group L.L.C. ("Cypress") and affiliates of CIVC Partners L.P.
("CIVC"), collectively the "Investor Group", completed the acquisition (the
"Transaction") of FGIC Corporation from a subsidiary of GE Capital in a
transaction valued at approximately $2,200,000. At the closing of the
Transaction, the Investor Group, acting through an affiliate, paid GE Capital
a cash purchase price of approximately $1,600,000, which was funded by equity
investments by the Investor Group and borrowings of approximately $227,300
under a bridge loan facility within an affiliate of Bank of America
Corporation. The bridge loan originally was to mature on December 16, 2004;
however, the bridge loan was repaid with the proceeds of the Senior Notes
issued on January 12, 2004. In addition, FGIC Corporation paid GE Capital
approximately $284,300 in pre-closing dividends and GE Capital retained 2,346
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Senior Preferred Shares") with an
aggregate liquidation preference of $234,600 and approximately 5% of FGIC
Corporation's common stock. PMI is the largest stockholder of FGIC
Corporation, owning approximately 42% of its common stock at December 31,
2003. Blackstone, Cypress and CIVC own approximately 23%, 23% and 7% of FGIC
Corporation's common stock, respectively, at December 31, 2003.

During 2004, the Company formed two subsidiaries; FGIC U.K. Services Limited
and FGIC U.K. Limited, both U.K. corporations.


                                                                             4

                         Notes to Financial Statements
                            (Unaudited) (continued)


                            (Dollars in thousands)


1. Basis of Presentation (continued)

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Operating
results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004 are not necessarily
indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2004.

These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and related notes included in the 2003 audited
financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

As a result of the Transaction effective on December 18, 2003, the basis of
the assets and liabilities has changed, which necessitates the presentation of
Predecessor Company and the Successor Company columns in the Balance Sheets,
Statements of Income and Cash Flows.

2. Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, FGIC U.K. Services Limited and FGIC U.K. Limited both U.K.
Corporations. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.

3. Income Taxes

The Company's effective federal corporate tax rate (23.5% and 21.7% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, and 25.1% and 17.1% for the
three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively) is less than the
statutory corporate tax rate (35%) on income due to permanent differences
between financial and taxable income, principally tax-exempt interest.


                                                                             5

6. Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"), which the Company
adopted on July 1, 2003. FIN 46's consolidation criteria are based upon
analysis of risks and rewards, not control, and represent a significant and
complex modification of previous accounting principles. FIN 46 represents an
accounting change not a change in the underlying economics associated with the
transactions, which may be affected by the Interpretation. FIN 46 clarifies
the consolidation criteria for certain entities in which equity investors do
not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46
requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary
beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among parties
involved. Variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not
be consolidated. FIN 46 requires disclosures for entities that have either a
primary or significant variable interest in a variable interest entity.

As a part of its structured finance business, the Company insures debt
obligations or certificates issued by special purposes entities. On September
30, 2004, the Company had approximately $1,110,405 of gross principal
outstanding related to insurance contracts issued to commercial paper
conduits--variable interest entities under FIN 46--which the Company does not
believe requires consolidation but which requires disclosure. With respect to
the remainder of the structured finance transactions insured, the Company has
evaluated the transactions, but does not believe any such transactions require
consolidation or disclosure under FIN 46.

7. Issuance of Preferred Trust Securities

On July 19, 2004, FGIC closed on its new $300,000 "Soft Capital" facility of
"Money Market Committed Preferred Custodial Trust Securities ("CPS
Securities"). This replaces the existing $300,000 "Soft Capital" facility
previously provided by GE Capital. The CPS securities are structured in six
separate and newly organized Delaware trusts, each trust will issue $50,000 in
CPS Securities on a rolling 28 day auction rate basis. Proceeds from these
securities are invested in high grade, short term securities (the "Eligible
Assets") and held in the respective trust. To draw down these funds, which are
available completely at the Company's discretion, the Company would exercise a
put option against each trust, whereby it issues in perpetual preferred shares
in FGIC to the holders of the securities in exchange for the Eligible Assets.
During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004, the Company
recorded expense of $387 for the right to put its shares to the Trusts. These
Trusts are considered variable interest entities under FIN46, however, the
Company is not considered the primary beneficiary and therefore is not
required to consolidate the Trusts.
