The attached tables and other statistical pool analyses, together with all
other information presented herein (the "Computational Materials") are
privileged and confidential and are intended for use by the addressee only.
These Computational Materials are furnished to you solely by Countrywide
Securities Corporation ("Countrywide Securities") and not by the issuer of the
securities or any of its affiliates (other than Countrywide Securities). The
issuer of these securities has not prepared or taken part in the preparation
of these materials. Neither Countrywide Securities, the issuer of the
securities nor any of its other affiliates makes any representation as to the
accuracy or completeness of the information herein. The information herein is
preliminary, and will be superseded by the applicable prospectus supplement,
any related supplement and by any other information subsequently filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information herein may not be
provided by the addressees to any third party other than the addressee's
legal, tax, financial and/or accounting advisors for the purposes of
evaluating said material.

Numerous assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which
may or may not be stated therein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
accuracy, appropriateness or completeness of the Computational Materials in
any particular context; or as to whether the Computational Materials and/or
the assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be
construed as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or
accounting advice.

Without limiting the foregoing, the collateral information set forth in these
Computational Materials, including without limitation the collateral tables
which follow, is based only on a statistical pool of Mortgage Loans expected
to be included in the Trust along with other Mortgage Loans on the Closing
Date. In addition, certain Mortgage Loans contained in this statistical pool
may be deleted from the final pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on
the Closing Date. This statistical pool may not necessarily represent a
statistically relevant population, notwithstanding any contrary references
herein. Although Countrywide Securities believes the information with respect
to the statistical pool will be representative of the final pool of Mortgage
Loans, the collateral characteristics of the final pool may nonetheless vary
from the collateral characteristics of the statistical pool.

Any yields or weighted average lives shown in the Computational Materials are
based on prepayment assumptions and actual prepayment experience may
dramatically affect such yields or weighted average lives. In addition, it is
possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur at rates slower
or faster than the rates assumed in the attached Computational Materials.
Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials assume no
losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfall. The specific
characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying
assets and the hypothetical assets used in preparing the Computational
Materials. The principal amount and designation of any security described in
the Computational Materials are subject to change prior to issuance.

Although a registration statement (including the prospectus) relating to the
securities discussed in this communication has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is effective, the final prospectus supplement
relating to the securities discussed in this communication has not been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This communication shall not
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy nor shall
there be any sale of the securities discussed in this communication in any
State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to
registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such State.
Prospective purchasers are referred to the final prospectus and prospectus
supplement relating to the securities discussed in this communication for
definitive Computational Materials on any matter discussed in this
communication. A final prospectus and prospectus supplement may be obtained by
contacting your Countrywide Securities account representative.


Please be advised that asset-backed securities may not be appropriate for all
investors. Potential investors must be willing to assume, among other things,
market price volatility, prepayments, yield curve and interest rate risk.
Investors should fully consider the risk of an investment in these securities.

If you have received this communication in error, please notify the sending
party immediately by telephone and return the original to such party by mail.







Recipients must read the information contained in the attached statement on
page 2. Do not use or rely on this information if you have not received or
reviewed the statement. If you have not received the statement, call your
Countrywide Securities account representative for another copy. The collateral
and other information set forth in the Computational Materials supersedes any
previously distributed information relating to the securities discussed in
this communication and will be superseded by the information set forth in the
final prospectus supplement.

The Mortgage Loans
- ------------------

Description of
Mortgage Loans:                The Trust will consist of two groups of home equity revolving credit line loans made
                               or to be made in the future under certain home equity revolving credit line loan
                               agreements (the "Group 1 Mortgage Loans", "Group 2 Mortgage Loans", and each, a "Loan
                               Group"). The Group 1 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds of trust or
                               mortgages on primarily one-to-four family residential properties with conforming loan
                               balances based on maximum credit limits and will bear interest at rates that adjust
                               based on the prime rate. The Group 2 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds
                               of trust or mortgages on primarily one-to-four family residential properties and will
                               bear interest at rates that adjust based on the prime rate. The original principal
                               balance of each class of Notes will exceed the sum of the aggregate Cut-off Date
                               principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group transferred to the
                               Trust on the closing date and any funds deposited in the related Pre-Funding Account.

                               "Closing Date Pool") is expected to have a Cut-off Date Balance of at least $689.5
                               million (subject to a variance of +/- 10%), but if such amount is smaller, then an
                               amount not greater than the shortfall (the "Pre-Funded Amount") shall be deposited in
                               the related Pre-Funding Account on the Closing Date as described in the following
                               paragraph. The information presented in these Computational Materials for the
                               Mortgage Loans, particularly in the collateral tables, which follow, reflects a
                               statistical pool of Mortgage Loans as of December 16, 2004. However, the
                               characteristics of the statistical pool are expected to be representative of the
                               Closing Date Pool.

Pre-funding:                   A deposit of not more than the Pre-Funded Amount related to each loan group will be
                               made to the related account of the two pre-funding account (the "Pre-Funding
                               Accounts"), each established with respect to a loan group, on the Closing Date. From
                               the Closing Date through January 15, 2005 (the "Funding Period"), the Pre-Funded
                               Amount will be used to purchase subsequent mortgage loans (the "Subsequent Mortgage
                               Loans"), which will be included in the Trust to create a final pool of Mortgage Loans
                               (the "Final Pool"). The characteristics of the Final Pool will vary from the
                               characteristics of the Closing Date Pool, although any such difference is not
                               expected to be material. It is expected that, after giving effect to the purchase of
                               Subsequent Mortgage Loans during the Funding Period, the Final Pool of Mortgage Loans
                               will be comprised of approximately $241,325,000 of Group 1 Mortgage Loans, and
                               approximately $448,175,000 of Group 2 Mortgage Loans. Any portion of the Pre-Funded
                               Amount remaining on the last day of the Funding Period will be distributed as
                               principal to the holders of the applicable class of Notes on the immediately
                               following Payment Date.

HELOC Amortization:            The Mortgage Loans are adjustable rate, home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") which
                               may be drawn upon generally for a period (the "Draw Period") of five (5) years
                               (which, in most cases, may be extendible for an additional five (5) years with
                               Countrywide's approval). HELOCs are generally subject to a fifteen (15) year
                               repayment period following the end of the Draw Period during which the outstanding
                               principal balance of the Mortgage Loan will be repaid in monthly installments equal
                               to 1/180 of the outstanding principal balance as of the end of the Draw Period. A
                               relatively small number of HELOCs are subject to a five (5), ten (10) or twenty (20)
                               year repayment period following the Draw Period during which the outstanding
                               principal balance of the loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments. None of
                               the Group 1 Mortgage Loans or the Group 2 Mortgage Loans in the statistical pool
                               require a balloon repayment at the end of the Draw Period.

Cut-off Date Balance:          The  aggregate  unpaid  principal  balance  of the  Mortgage  Loans  comprising  the
                               Closing Date Pool as of the Cut-off Date.

The Notes
- ---------

Description
of the Notes:                  The Class 1-A and Class 2-A Notes (together, the "Notes") will be issued by CWABS
                               Revolving Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2004-U (the "Trust"). As of the Closing
                               Date, the aggregate principal balance of both classes of the Notes will be
                               $700,000,000 (subject to a permitted variance of +/- 10%).

Federal Tax Status:            It is  anticipated  that the Notes will be treated as debt  instruments  for federal
                               income tax purposes.

Registration:                  The Notes will be available in  book-entry  form  through DTC,  Clearstream  and the
                               Euroclear System.

Note Rate:                     Except as noted below, each class of Notes will accrue interest during each Interest
                               Accrual Period at a rate equal to the least of: (a) one-month LIBOR, plus [0.24]%,
                               (b) the Net WAC of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group, and (c) 16.00%. With
                               respect to the initial Interest Accrual Period only, the rate calculated in clause
                               (a) above will be based on an interpolated mid-point LIBOR (using the 1-month and
                               2-month LIBOR as benchmarks).

Net WAC:                       The "Net WAC" of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans shall mean the weighted
                               average of the loan rates of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans (as applicable),
                               weighted on the basis of the daily average balance of each Mortgage Loan in the
                               applicable Loan Group during the related billing cycle for the Collection Period
                               relating to the Payment Date, net of the Expense Fee Rate.

Expense Fee Rate:              For any Payment Date, the "Expense Fee Rate" shall be an amount equal to the sum of
                               (i) the servicing fee rate, (ii) the note insurer premium rate times a fraction, the
                               numerator of which is the Note principal balance of the applicable class of Notes and
                               the denominator of which is the sum of the related Loan Group Balance and any amount
                               in the related Pre-Funding Account allocated to that loan group, and (iii) commencing
                               with the Payment Date in February 2006, the Note Insurer Carve-out Rate. The "Note
                               Insurer Carve-out Rate" for any given Payment Date on and after the February 2006
                               Payment Date shall be equal to 0.50%.

Basis Risk Carryforward:       On any Payment Date the "Basis Risk Carryforward" for either Class of Notes will
                               equal, the sum of (x) the excess of (a) the amount of interest that would have
                               accrued on such Notes during the related Interest Accrual Period without giving
                               effect to the related Net WAC cap, over (b) the amount of interest that actually
                               accrued on such Notes during such period, and (y) any Basis Risk Carryforward
                               remaining unpaid from prior Payment Dates together with accrued interest thereon at
                               the Note Rate without giving effect to the related Net WAC cap. The Basis Risk
                               Carryforward will be paid to the related class of Notes to the extent funds are
                               available from the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group as set forth in "Group 1
                               Distributions of Interest" or "Group 2 Distributions of Interest" (as applicable),
                               below.

Group 1
Distributions of Interest:     Investor  interest  collections  related  to the  Group 1  Mortgage  Loans are to be
                               applied in the following order of priority:

                                    periods (exclusive of Basis Risk Carryforward);
                               3.   To the Class 1-A Notes in respect of Investor Loss Amounts allocable to such Notes
                                    (as described below) for such Payment Date;
                               4.   To the Class 1-A Notes in respect of Investor Loss Amounts allocable to such Notes
                                    (as described below) for previous Payment Dates to the extent not previously
                                    reimbursed, absorbed or funded (as provided in the indenture);
                               5.   To the Class 2-A Notes, accrued monthly interest at the related Note Rate together
                                    with any overdue accrued monthly interest from prior periods (exclusive of Basis
                                    Risk Carryforward), that remains unpaid after taking into account the payments of
                                    Investor Interest Collections from the Group 2 Mortgage Loans;
                               6.   Reimbursement to the Note Insurer for prior draws on its insurance policy (with
                                    interest thereon) relating to the Group 1 Mortgage Loans;
                               7.   Paydown of the Class 1-A Notes to create and maintain the required level of
                                    overcollateralization;

                               12.  Reimbursement to the Note Insurer for prior draws on its insurance policy and
                                    any other amount owed to the Note Insurer, in each case with respect to Group 1
                                    Mortgage Loans;
                               13.  Basis Risk Carryforward related to the Class 2-A Notes; and
                               14.  Any excess cash flow to the holder of the Transferor Interest.

                               In the circumstances described in the prospectus supplement, Investor Loss Amounts
                               for a Class of Notes may be funded or absorbed by the Allocated Transferor Interest and
                               Subordinated Transferor Collections for the unrelated Loan Group.


Distributions of Principal:    Collections of principal related to the Mortgage Loans in each Loan Group are to be
                               applied to the related class of Notes in the following order of priority:

                               1.   During the Managed Amortization Period (as described below), the amount of
                                    principal payable to the holder of a class of Notes for each Payment Date will
                                    equal, to the extent funds are available from the related Loan Group, the lesser
                                    of (a) the product of (i) the Investor Fixed Allocation Percentage (as defined
                                    below) for those Notes, and (ii) principal collections from the related Loan
                                    Group relating to such Payment Date (such product, the "Maximum Principal
                                    Payment"), and (b) principal collections from the related Loan Group for the
                                    related Payment Date less the sum of additional balances created from new draws
                                    on the Mortgage Loans in that Loan Group during the related Collection Period
                                    (but not less than zero).

                                    The "Managed Amortization Period" for each class of Notes shall mean the period
                                    beginning on the Closing Date and, unless a Rapid Amortization Event (i.e.,
                                    certain events of default or other material non-compliance by the Sponsor under
                                    the terms of the related transaction documents) shall have earlier occurred,
                                    through and including the Payment Date in January 2010.

                                    The "Investor Fixed Allocation Percentage" for any Payment Date and each Class of
                                    Notes will be calculated as follows: (i) on any date on which the related
                                    Allocated Transferor Interest is less than the related Required Transferor
                                    Subordinated Amount, 100%, and (ii) on any date on which the related Allocated
                                    Transferor Interest equals or exceeds the related Required Transferor
                                    Subordinated Amount, 98.60%.

                               2.   After the Managed Amortization Period, the amount of principal payable to the
                                    holders of each class of Notes will be equal to the related Maximum Principal
                                    Payment.

Optional Termination:          The Notes may be retired as a result of the owner of the Transferor Interest
                               purchasing all of the mortgage loans then included in the trust estate on any payment
                               date on or after which the aggregate principal balance of both classes of Notes is
                               less than or equal to 10% of the initial aggregate principal balance of the Notes of
                               both classes.

Credit Enhancement:            The Trust will  include  the  following  mechanisms,  each of which is  intended  to
                               provide credit support for the Notes:

                               1.   Excess Interest Collections. For any Loan Group, its Excess Interest Collections
                                    are the related investor interest collections minus the sum of (a) the interest
                                    paid to the related class of Notes, (b) the servicing fee retained by the Master
                                    Servicer for the Mortgage Loans in that Loan Group, and (c) the premium paid to
                                    the Note Insurer allocable to that Loan Group. Investor Interest Collections
                                    from a Loan Group will be available to cover losses on

                               the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group first and then, if necessary, in the
                               unrelated Loan Group.

                               2.   Limited Subordination of Transferor Interest (Overcollateralization). A portion
                                    of the Allocated Transferor Interest related to each Loan Group will be
                                    available to provide limited protection against Investor Loss Amounts in such
                                    Loan Group (as defined below) up to the Available Transferor Subordinated Amount
                                    for such Loan Group and then, if necessary for the unrelated Loan Group. The
                                    "Available Transferor Subordinated Amount" for each Loan Group is, for any
                                    Payment Date, the lesser of the related Allocated Transferor Interest and the
                                    related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount. The "Allocated Transferor
                                    Interest" for any Payment Date, will equal (a) the related Loan Group Balance of
                                    the related Loan Group at the last day of the related Collection Period, any
                                    amounts otherwise payable on the Transferor Interest but retained in the Payment
                                    Account and any funds in the related Pre-Funding Account, minus (b) the Note
                                    Principal Balance of the class of Notes related to that Loan Group (after giving
                                    effect to the payment of all amounts actually paid on that class of Notes on
                                    that Payment Date). Subject to any step-down or step-up as may be permitted or
                                    required by the transaction documents, the "Required Transferor Subordinated
                                    Amount" for each Loan Group will be (i) prior to the date on which the step-down
                                    occurs, 1.40% of the Cut-off Date Balance of the related Mortgage Loans and any
                                    funds in the related Pre-Funding Account on the closing date and (ii) on or
                                    after the date on which the step-down occurs and so long as a trigger event is
                                    not in effect, 2.80% of the then current unpaid principal balance of the related
                                    Loan Group (subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the sum of the Cut-off Date
                                    Balance of the related Loan Group and any amounts in the related Pre-Funding
                                    Account on the Closing Date). The Allocated Transferor Interest for each Loan
                                    Group will be less than zero on the Closing Date.

                                    The initial aggregate principal balance of each class of Notes will exceed the sum
                                    of the aggregate Cut-off Date principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the
                                    related Loan Group included in the Closing Date Pool, and any funds in the
                                    related Pre-Funding Account on the Closing Date. This excess represents an
                                    undercollateralization of approximately 1.50% of the original principal balance
                                    of the Notes.

                               3.   Surety Wrap. FGIC will issue a note insurance policy, which will guarantee the
                                    timely payment of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal to the
                                    holders of the Notes. The policy does not cover payment of Basis Risk
                                    Carryforward.

Investor Loss Amounts:         With respect to any Payment Date and each Class of Notes, the amount equal to the
                               product of (a) the applicable Investor Floating Allocation Percentage (as defined
                               below) for such Payment Date and such Class of Notes, and (b) the aggregate of the
                               Liquidation Loss Amounts for such Payment Date from Mortgage Loans in the relevant
                               Loan Group. The "Investor Floating Allocation Percentage," for any Payment Date and
                               each Loan Group shall be the lesser of 100% and a fraction, the numerator of which is
                               the related Note Principal Balance and the denominator of which is the Loan Group
                               Balance of the related Mortgage Loans at the beginning of the related Collection
                               Period, plus any funds in the related Pre-Funding Account. The "Loan Group Balance"
                               for each Loan Group and any Payment Date is the aggregate of the principal balances
                               of the related Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the related Collection Period (as
                               may be adjusted by Loss Utilization Amounts as described in the indenture).
                               "Liquidation Loss Amounts" for any liquidated Mortgage Loan and any Payment Date is
                               the unrecovered principal balance of such Mortgage Loan at the end of the Collection
                               Period in which such Mortgage Loan became a liquidated Mortgage Loan, after giving
                               effect to its net liquidation proceeds.

ERISA Eligibility:             Subject to the considerations in the prospectus supplement, the Notes are expected to
                               be eligible for purchase by certain ERISA plans. Prospective investors must review

The attached tables and other statistical pool analyses, together with all
other information presented herein (the "Computational Materials") are
privileged and confidential and are intended for use by the addressee only.
These Computational Materials are furnished to you solely by Countrywide
Securities Corporation ("Countrywide Securities") and not by the issuer of the
securities or any of its affiliates (other than Countrywide Securities). The
issuer of these securities has not prepared or taken part in the preparation
of these materials. Neither Countrywide Securities, the issuer of the

the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information herein may not be
provided by the addressees to any third party other than the addressee's
legal, tax, financial and/or accounting advisors for the purposes of
evaluating said material.


Numerous assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which
may or may not be stated therein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
accuracy, appropriateness or completeness of the Computational Materials in
any particular context; or as to whether the Computational Materials and/or
the assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be
construed as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or
accounting advice.


Without limiting the foregoing, the collateral information set forth in these
Computational Materials, including without limitation the collateral tables
which follow, is based only on a statistical pool of Mortgage Loans expected
to be included in the Trust along with other Mortgage Loans on the Closing
Date. In addition, certain Mortgage Loans contained in this statistical pool
may be deleted from the final pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on
the Closing Date. This statistical pool may not necessarily represent a
statistically relevant population, notwithstanding any contrary references
herein. Although Countrywide Securities believes the information with respect
to the statistical pool will be representative of the final pool of Mortgage
Loans, the collateral characteristics of the final pool may nonetheless vary
from the collateral characteristics of the statistical pool.


Any yields or weighted average lives shown in the Computational Materials are
based on prepayment assumptions and actual prepayment experience may
dramatically affect such yields or weighted average lives. In addition, it is
possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur at rates slower
or faster than the rates assumed in the attached Computational Materials.
Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials assume no
losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfall. The specific
characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying
assets and the hypothetical assets used in preparing the Computational
Materials. The principal amount and designation of any security described in
the Computational Materials are subject to change prior to issuance.

The Mortgage Loans
- ------------------

Description of
Mortgage Loans:                The Trust will consist of two groups of home equity revolving credit line loans made
                               or to be made in the future under certain home equity revolving credit line loan
                               agreements (the "Group 1 Mortgage Loans", "Group 2 Mortgage Loans", and each, a "Loan
                               Group"). The Group 1 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds of trust or
                               mortgages on primarily one-to-four family residential properties with conforming loan
                               balances based on maximum credit limits and will bear interest at rates that adjust
                               based on the prime rate. The Group 2 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds
                               of trust or mortgages on primarily one-to-four family residential properties and will
                               bear interest at rates that adjust based on the prime rate. The original principal
                               balance of each class of Notes will exceed the sum of the aggregate Cut-off Date
                               principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group transferred to the
                               Trust on the closing date and any funds deposited in the related Pre-Funding Account.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S>                            <C>
                               The actual pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on the Closing Date ("the
                               Closing Date Pool") is expected to have a Cut-off Date Balance of at least $689.5
                               million (subject to a variance of +/- 10%), but if such amount is smaller, then an
                               amount not greater than the shortfall (the "Pre-Funded Amount") shall be deposited in
                               the related Pre-Funding Account on the Closing Date as described in the following
                               paragraph. The information presented in these Computational Materials for the
                               Mortgage Loans, particularly in the collateral tables, which follow, reflects a
                               statistical pool of Mortgage Loans as of December 16, 2004. However, the
                               characteristics of the statistical pool are expected to be representative of the
                               Closing Date Pool.

Pre-funding:                   A deposit of not more than the Pre-Funded Amount related to each loan group will be
                               made to the related account of the two pre-funding accounts (the "Pre-Funding
                               Accounts"), each established with respect to a loan group, on the Closing Date. From
                               the Closing Date through January 15, 2005 (the "Funding Period"), the Pre-Funded
                               Amount will be used to purchase subsequent mortgage loans (the "Subsequent Mortgage
                               Loans"), which will be included in the Trust to create a final pool of Mortgage Loans
                               (the "Final Pool"). The characteristics of the Final Pool will vary from the
                               characteristics of the Closing Date Pool, although any such difference is not
                               expected to be material. It is expected that, after giving effect to the purchase of
                               Subsequent Mortgage Loans during the Funding Period, the Final Pool of Mortgage Loans
                               will be comprised of approximately $241,325,000 of Group 1 Mortgage Loans, and
                               approximately $448,175,000 of Group 2 Mortgage Loans. Any portion of the Pre-Funded
                               Amount remaining on the last day of the Funding Period will be distributed as
                               principal to the holders of the applicable class of Notes on the immediately
                               following Payment Date.

HELOC Amortization:            The Mortgage Loans are adjustable rate, home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") which
                               may be drawn upon generally for a period (the "Draw Period") of five (5) years
                               (which, in most cases, may be extendible for an additional five (5) years with
                               Countrywide's approval). HELOCs are generally subject to a fifteen (15) year
                               repayment period following the end of the Draw Period during which the outstanding
                               principal balance of the Mortgage Loan will be repaid in monthly installments equal
                               to 1/180 of the outstanding principal balance as of the end of the Draw Period. A
                               relatively small number of HELOCs are subject to a five (5), ten (10) or twenty (20)
                               year repayment period following the Draw Period during which the outstanding
                               principal balance of the loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments. None of
                               the Group 1 Mortgage Loans or the Group 2 Mortgage Loans in the statistical pool
                               require a balloon repayment at the end of the Draw Period.

Cut-off Date Balance:          The aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans comprising the Closing
                               Date Pool as of the Cut-off Date.

The Notes
- ---------

Description
of the Notes:                  The Class 1-A and Class 2-A Notes (together, the "Notes") will be issued by CWABS
                               Revolving Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2004-U (the "Trust"). As of the Closing
                               Date, the aggregate principal balance of both classes of the Notes will be
                               $700,000,000 (subject to a permitted variance of +/- 10%).

Federal Tax Status:            It is anticipated that the Notes will be treated as debt instruments for federal
                               income tax purposes.

Registration:                  The Notes will be available in book-entry form through DTC, Clearstream and the
                               Euroclear System.

Note Rate:                     Except as noted below, each class of Notes will accrue interest during each Interest
                               Accrual Period at a rate equal to the least of: (a) one-month LIBOR, plus [0.24]%,
                               (b) the Net WAC of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group, and (c) 16.00%. With
                               respect to the initial Interest Accrual Period only, the rate calculated in clause
                               (a) above will be based on an interpolated mid-point LIBOR (using the 1-month and
                               2-month LIBOR as benchmarks).

Net WAC:                       The "Net WAC" of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans shall mean the weighted
                               average of the loan rates of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans (as applicable),
                               weighted on the basis of the daily average balance of each Mortgage Loan in the
                               applicable Loan Group during the related billing cycle for the Collection Period
                               relating to the Payment Date, net of the Expense Fee Rate.

Expense Fee Rate:              For any Payment Date, the "Expense Fee Rate" shall be an amount equal to the sum of
                               (i) the servicing fee rate, (ii) the note insurer premium rate times a fraction, the
                               numerator of which is the Note principal balance of the applicable class of Notes and
                               the denominator of which is the sum of the related Loan Group Balance and any amount
                               in the related Pre-Funding Account, and (iii) commencing with the Payment Date in
                               February 2006, the Note Insurer Carve-out Rate. The "Note Insurer Carve-out Rate" for
                               any given Payment Date on and after the February 2006 Payment Date shall be equal to
                               0.50%.

Basis Risk Carryforward:       On any Payment Date the "Basis Risk Carryforward" for either Class of Notes will
                               equal, the sum of (x) the excess of (a) the amount of interest that would have
                               accrued on such Notes during the related Interest Accrual Period without giving
                               effect to the related Net WAC cap, over (b) the amount of interest that actually
                               accrued on such Notes during such period, and (y) any Basis Risk Carryforward
                               remaining unpaid from prior Payment Dates together with accrued interest thereon at
                               the Note Rate without giving effect to the related Net WAC cap. The Basis Risk
                               Carryforward will be paid to the related class of Notes to the extent funds are
                               available from the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group as set forth in "Group 1
                               Distributions of Interest" or "Group 2 Distributions of Interest" (as applicable),

                               3.   To the Class 1-A Notes in respect of Investor Loss Amounts allocable to such

                                    of Basis Risk Carryforward), that remains unpaid after taking into account the
                                    payments of Investor Interest Collections from the Group 2 Mortgage Loans;

                               14.  Any excess cash flow to the holder of the Transferor Interest.

                               In the circumstances described in the prospectus supplement, Investor Loss Amounts
                               for a Class of Notes may be funded or absorbed by the Allocated Transferor Interest
                               and Subordinated Transferor Collections for the unrelated Loan Group.

Distributions of Principal:    Collections of principal related to the Mortgage Loans in each Loan Group are to be
                               applied to the related class of Notes in the following order of priority:

                               1.   During the Managed Amortization Period (as described below), the amount of
                                    principal payable to the holder of a class of Notes for each Payment Date will
                                    equal, to the extent funds are available from the related Loan Group, the lesser
                                    of (a) the product of (i) the Investor Fixed Allocation Percentage (as defined
                                    below) for those Notes, and (ii) principal collections from the related Loan
                                    Group relating to such Payment Date (such product, the "Maximum Principal
                                    Payment"), and (b) principal collections from the related Loan Group for the
                                    related Payment Date less the sum of additional balances created from new draws
                                    on the Mortgage Loans in that Loan Group during the related Collection Period
                                    (but not less than zero).

                                    The "Managed Amortization Period" for each class of Notes shall mean the period
                                    beginning on the Closing Date and, unless a Rapid Amortization Event (i.e., certain
                                    events of default or other material non-compliance by the Sponsor under the terms of
                                    the related transaction documents) shall have earlier occurred, through and including
                                    the Payment Date in January 2010.

                                    The "Investor Fixed Allocation Percentage" for any Payment Date and each Class of
                                    Notes will be calculated as follows: (i) on any date on which the related Allocated
                                    Transferor Interest is less than the related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount,
                                    100%, and (ii) on any date on which the related Allocated Transferor Interest equals
                                    or exceeds the related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount, 98.60%.

                               2.   After the Managed Amortization Period, the amount of principal payable to the
                                    holders of each class of Notes will be equal to the related Maximum Principal
                                    Payment.

Optional Termination:          The Notes may be retired as a result of the owner of the Transferor Interest
                               purchasing all of the mortgage loans then included in the trust estate on any payment
                               date on or after which the aggregate principal balance of both classes of Notes is
                               less than or equal to 10% of the initial aggregate principal balance of the Notes of
                               both classes.

Credit Enhancement:            The Trust will include the following mechanisms, each of which is intended to provide
                               credit support for the Notes:

                               1.   Excess Interest Collections. For any Loan Group, its Excess Interest Collections
                                    are the related investor interest collections minus the sum of (a) the interest
                                    paid to the related class of Notes, (b) the servicing fee retained by the Master
                                    Servicer for the Mortgage Loans in that Loan Group, and (c) the premium paid to
                                    the Note Insurer allocable to that Loan Group. Investor Interest Collections
                                    from a Loan Group will be available to cover losses on the Mortgage Loans in the
                                    related Loan Group first and then, if necessary, in the unrelated Loan Group.

                               2.   Limited Subordination of Transferor Interest (Overcollateralization). A portion
                                    of the Allocated Transferor Interest related to each Loan Group will be
                                    available to provide limited protection against Investor Loss Amounts in such
                                    Loan Group (as defined below) up to the Available Transferor Subordinated Amount
                                    for such Loan Group and then, if necessary for the unrelated Loan Group. The
                                    "Available Transferor Subordinated Amount" for each Loan Group is, for any
                                    Payment Date, the lesser of the related Allocated Transferor Interest and the
                                    related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount. The "Allocated Transferor
                                    Interest" for any Payment Date, will equal (a) the related Loan Group Balance of
                                    the related Loan Group at the last day of the related Collection Period, any
                                    amounts otherwise payable on the Transferor Interest but retained in the Payment
                                    Account and any funds in the related Pre-Funding Account, minus (b) the Note
                                    Principal Balance of the class of Notes related to that Loan Group (after giving
                                    effect to the payment of all amounts actually paid on that class of Notes on
                                    that Payment Date). Subject to any step-down or step-up as may be permitted or
                                    required by the transaction documents, the "Required Transferor Subordinated
                                    Amount" for each Loan Group will be (i) prior to the date on which the step-down
                                    occurs, 1.40% of the Cut-off Date Balance of the related Mortgage Loans and
                                    funds in the related Pre-Funding Account on the closing date and (ii) on or
                                    after the date on which the step-down occurs and so long as a trigger event is
                                    not in effect, 2.80% of the then current unpaid principal balance of the related
                                    Loan Group (subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the sum of the Cut-off Date
                                    Balance of the related Loan Group and any amounts in the related Pre-Funding
                                    Account on the Closing Date). The Allocated Transferor Interest for each Loan
                                    Group will be less than zero on the Closing Date.

                                    The initial aggregate principal balance of each class of Notes will exceed the sum of
                                    the aggregate Cut-off Date principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related
                                    Loan Group included in the Closing Date Pool, and any funds in the related
                                    Pre-Funding Account on the Closing Date. This excess represents an
                                    undercollateralization of approximately 1.50% of the original principal balance of
                                    the Notes.

                                    timely payment of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal to the holders of
                                    the Notes. The policy does not cover payment of Basis Risk Carryforward.

Investor Loss Amounts:         With respect to any Payment Date and each Class of Notes, the amount equal to the
                               product of (a) the applicable Investor Floating Allocation Percentage (as defined
                               below) for such Payment Date and such Class of Notes, and (b) the aggregate of the
                               Liquidation Loss Amounts for such Payment Date from Mortgage Loans in the relevant
                               Loan Group. The "Investor Floating Allocation Percentage," for any Payment Date and
                               each Loan Group shall be the lesser of 100% and a fraction, the numerator of which is
                               the related Note Principal Balance and the denominator of which is the Loan Group
                               Balance of the related Mortgage Loans at the beginning of the related Collection
                               Period, plus any funds in the related Pre-Funding Account. The "Loan Group Balance"
                               for each Loan Group and any Payment Date is the aggregate of the
