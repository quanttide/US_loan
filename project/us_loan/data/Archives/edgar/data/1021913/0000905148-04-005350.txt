The attached tables and other statistical pool analyses, together with all other
information presented herein (the "Computational Materials") are privileged and
confidential and are intended for use by the addressee only. These Computational
Materials are furnished to you solely by Countrywide Securities Corporation
("Countrywide Securities") and not by the issuer of the securities or any of its
affiliates (other than Countrywide Securities). The issuer of these securities
has not prepared or taken part in the preparation of these materials. Neither
Countrywide Securities, the issuer of the securities nor any of its other
affiliates makes any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the
information herein. The information herein is preliminary, and will be
superseded by the applicable prospectus supplement, any related supplement and
by any other information subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The information herein may not be provided by the addressees to any
third party other than the addressee's legal, tax, financial and/or accounting
advisors for the purposes of evaluating said material.


Numerous assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which
may or may not be stated therein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
accuracy, appropriateness or completeness of the Computational Materials in any
particular context; or as to whether the Computational Materials and/or the
assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be construed
as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or accounting
advice.


Without limiting the foregoing, the collateral information set forth in these
Computational Materials, including without limitation the collateral tables
which follow, is based only on a statistical pool of Mortgage Loans expected to
be included in the Trust along with other Mortgage Loans on the Closing Date. In
addition, certain Mortgage Loans contained in this statistical pool may be
deleted from the final pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on the
Closing Date. This statistical pool may not necessarily represent a
statistically relevant population, notwithstanding any contrary references
herein. Although Countrywide Securities believes the information with respect to
the statistical pool will be representative of the final pool of Mortgage Loans,
the collateral characteristics of the final pool may nonetheless vary from the
collateral characteristics of the statistical pool.


 Any yields or weighted average lives shown in the Computational Materials are
based on prepayment assumptions and actual prepayment experience may
dramatically affect such yields or weighted average lives. In addition, it is
possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur at rates slower or
faster than the rates assumed in the attached Computational Materials.
Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials assume no
losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfall. The specific
characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying assets
and the hypothetical assets used in preparing the Computational Materials. The
principal amount and designation of any security described in the Computational
Materials are subject to change prior to issuance.


Although a registration statement (including the prospectus) relating to the
securities discussed in this communication has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is effective, the final prospectus supplement
relating to the securities discussed in this communication has not been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This communication shall not
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy nor shall
there be any sale of the securities discussed in this communication in any State
in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to
registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such State.
Prospective purchasers are referred to the final prospectus and prospectus
supplement relating to the securities discussed in this communication for
definitive Computational Materials on any matter discussed in this
communication. A final prospectus and prospectus supplement may be obtained by
contacting your Countrywide Securities account representative.


Please be advised that asset-backed securities may not be appropriate for all
investors. Potential investors must be willing to assume, among other things,
market price volatility, prepayments, yield curve and interest rate risk.
Investors should fully consider the risk of an investment in these securities.

If you have received this communication in error, please notify the sending
party immediately by telephone and return the original to such party by mail.





Recipients must read the information contained in the attached statement on page
2. Do not use or rely on this information if you have not received or reviewed
the statement. If you have not received the statement, call your Countrywide
Securities account representative for another copy. The collateral and other
information set forth in the Computational Materials supersedes any previously
distributed information relating to the securities discussed in this
communication and will be superseded by the information set forth in the final

The Mortgage Loans
- ------------------

Description of
Mortgage Loans:                The Trust will consist of two groups of home equity revolving credit line loans made or to be
                               made in the future under certain home equity revolving credit line loan agreements (the
                               "Group 1 Mortgage Loans", "Group 2 Mortgage Loans", and each, a "Loan Group"). The Group
                               1 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds of trust or mortgages on primarily
                               one-to-four family residential properties with conforming loan balances based on maximum
                               credit limits and will bear interest at rates that adjust based on the prime rate. The
                               Group 2 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds of trust or mortgages on primarily
                               one-to-four family residential properties and will bear interest at rates that adjust
                               based on the prime rate. The original principal balance of each class of Notes will
                               exceed the aggregate Cut-off Date principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related
                               Loan Group transferred to the Trust on the closing date.

                               The actual pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on the Closing Date is expected
                               to have a Cut-off Date Balance of at least $1,467.65 million (subject to a variance of
                               +/- 10%). The information presented in these Computational Materials for the Mortgage
                               Loans, particularly in the collateral tables, which follow, reflects a statistical pool
                               of Mortgage Loans as of October 29, 2004. However, the characteristics of the statistical
                               pool are expected to be representative of the final pool of Mortgage Loans actually
                               delivered to the Trust on the Closing Date.

HELOC Amortization:            The Mortgage Loans are adjustable rate, home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") which may
                               be drawn upon generally for a period (the "Draw Period") of five (5) years (which, in
                               most cases, may be extendible for an additional five (5) years with Countrywide's
                               approval). HELOCs are generally subject to a fifteen (15) year repayment period following
                               the end of the Draw Period during which the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage
                               Loan will be repaid in monthly installments equal to 1/180 of the outstanding principal
                               balance as of the end of the Draw Period. A relatively small number of HELOCs are subject
                               to a five (5), ten (10) or twenty (20) year repayment period following the Draw Period
                               during which the outstanding principal balance of the loan will be repaid in equal
                               monthly installments. None of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans require a balloon repayment at
                               the end of the Draw Period and approximately 0.04% of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans require
                               a balloon repayment at the end of the Draw Period.

Cut-off Date Balance:          The aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date.

The Notes
- ---------

Description
of the Notes:                  The Class 1-A and Class 2-A Notes (together, the "Notes") will be issued by CWABS
                               Revolving Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2004-R (the "Trust"). As of the Closing Date,
                               the aggregate principal balance of both classes of the Notes will be $1,490,000,000
                               (subject to a permitted variance of +/- 10%).

Federal Tax Status:            It is anticipated that the Notes will be treated as debt instruments for federal
                               income tax purposes.

Registration:                  The Notes will be available in book-entry form through DTC, Clearstream and the
                               Euroclear System.

Note Rate:                     Except as noted below, each class of Notes will accrue interest during each Interest
                               Accrual Period at a rate equal to the least of: (a) one-month LIBOR, plus 0.28%, (b) the
                               Net WAC of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group, and (c) 16.00%. With respect to
                               the initial Interest Accrual Period only, the rate calculated in clause (a) above will be
                               based on an interpolated mid-point LIBOR (using the 1-month and 2-month LIBOR as
                               benchmarks).

Net WAC:                       The "Net WAC" of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans shall mean the weighted average
                               of the loan rates of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans (as applicable), weighted on
                               the basis of the daily average balance of each Mortgage Loan in the applicable Loan Group
                               during the related billing cycle before the Collection Period relating to the Payment
                               Date, net of the Expense Fee Rate.

Expense Fee Rate:              For any Payment Date, the "Expense Fee Rate" shall be an amount equal to the sum of (i)
                               the servicing fee rate, (ii) the note insurer premium rate times a fraction, the
                               numerator of which is

                                    Transferor Interest is less than the related Required Transferor Subordinated
                                    Amount, 100%, and (ii) on any date on which the related Allocated Transferor
                                    Interest equals or exceeds the related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount,
                                    98.55% for the Class 1-A Notes and 98.10% for the Class 2-A Notes.

                               2.   After the Managed Amortization Period, the amount of principal payable to the
                                    holders of each class of Notes will be equal to the related Maximum Principal
                                    Payment.

Optional Termination:          The Notes may be retired as a result of the owner of the Transferor Interest purchasing
                               all of the mortgage loans then included in the trust estate on any payment date on or
                               after which the aggregate principal balance of both classes of Notes is less than or
                               equal to 10% of the initial aggregate principal balance of the Notes of both
                               classes.

Credit Enhancement:            The Trust will include the following mechanisms, each of which is intended to provide
                               credit support for the Notes:

                               1.   Excess Interest Collections. For any Loan Group, its Excess Interest Collections are
                                    the related investor interest collections minus the sum of (a) the interest paid to
                                    the related class of Notes, (b) the servicing fee retained by the Master Servicer
                                    for the Mortgage Loans in that Loan Group, and (c) the premium paid to the Note
                                    Insurer allocable to that Loan Group. Investor Interest Collections from a Loan
                                    Group will be available to cover losses on the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan
                                    Group first and then, if necessary, in the unrelated Loan Group.

                               2.   Limited Subordination of Transferor Interest (Overcollateralization). A portion of
                                    the Allocated Transferor Interest related to each Loan Group will be available to
                                    provide limited protection against Investor Loss Amounts in such Loan Group (as
                                    defined below) up to the Available Transferor Subordinated Amount for such Loan
                                    Group. The "Available Transferor Subordinated Amount" for each Loan Group is, for
                                    any Payment Date, the lesser of the related Allocated Transferor Interest and the
                                    related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount. The "Allocated Transferor Interest"
                                    for any date of determination, will equal (a) the related Loan Group Balance of the
                                    related Loan Group at the close of business on the prior day, minus (b) the Note
                                    Principal Balance of the class of Notes related to that Loan Group (after giving
                                    effect to the distribution of all amounts actually distributed on that class of
                                    Notes on that date). Subject to any step-down or step-up as may be permitted or
                                    required by the transaction documents, the "Required Transferor Subordinated Amount"
                                    (x) for the Group 1 Mortgage Loans will be (i) prior to the date on which the
                                    step-down occurs, 1.45% of the Cut-off Date Balance of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans
                                    and (ii) on or after the date on which the step-down occurs and so long as a trigger
                                    event is not in effect, 2.90% of the then current unpaid principal balance of the
                                    Group 1 Mortgage Loans (subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the Cut-off Date
                                    Balance of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans) and (y) for the Group 2 Mortgage Loans will
                                    be (i) prior to the date on which the step-down occurs, 1.90% of the Cut-off Date
                                    Balance of the Group 2

                               Mortgage Loans and (ii) on or after the date on which the step-down occurs and as long as
                               a trigger event is not in effect, 3.80% if the then current unpaid principal balance
                               of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans (subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the Cut-off Date
                               Balance of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans). The Allocated Transferor Interest for each
                               Loan Group will be less than zero on the Closing Date.

                               The initial aggregate principal balance of each class of Notes will exceed the aggregate
                               Cut-off Date principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group
                               transferred to the issuer on the closing date. This excess represents an
                               undercollateralization of approximately 1.50% of the original principal balance of
                               the Notes.

                               3.   Surety Wrap. XL Capital will issue a note insurance policy, which will guarantee the
                                    timely payment of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal to the holders of
                                    the Notes. The policy does not cover payment of Basis Risk Carryforward.

Investor Loss Amounts:         With respect to any Payment Date and each Class of Notes, the amount equal to the product of
                               (a) the applicable Investor Floating Allocation Percentage (as defined below) for such
                               Payment Date and such Class of Notes, and (b) the aggregate of the Liquidation Loss
                               Amounts for such Payment Date from Mortgage Loans in the relevant Loan Group. The
                               "Investor Floating Allocation Percentage," for any Payment Date and each Loan Group shall
                               be the lesser of 100% and a fraction, the numerator of which is the related Note
                               Principal Balance and the denominator of which is the Loan Group Balance of the related
                               Mortgage Loans at the beginning of the related Collection Period. The "Loan Group
                               Balance" for each Loan Group and any date is the aggregate of the principal balances of
                               the related Mortgage Loans as of such date. "Liquidation Loss Amounts" for any liquidated
                               Mortgage Loan and any Payment Date is the unrecovered principal balance of such Mortgage
                               Loan at the end of the Collection Period in which such Mortgage Loan became a liquidated
                               Mortgage Loan, after giving effect to its net liquidation proceeds.

ERISA Eligibility:             Subject to the considerations in the prospectus supplement, the Notes are expected to
                               be eligible for purchase by certain ERISA plans. Prospective investors must review the
                               related prospectus and prospectus supplement and consult with their professional advisors
                               for a more detailed description of these matters prior to investing in the Notes.

SMMEA Treatment:               The Notes will not constitute "mortgage related securities" for purposes of SMMEA.

The attached tables and other statistical pool analyses, together with all
other information presented herein (the "Computational Materials") are
privileged and confidential and are intended for use by the addressee only.
These Computational Materials are furnished to you solely by Countrywide
Securities Corporation ("Countrywide Securities") and not by the issuer of the
securities or any of its affiliates (other than Countrywide Securities). The
issuer of these securities has not prepared or taken part in the preparation
of these materials. Neither Countrywide Securities, the issuer of the
securities nor any of its other affiliates makes any representation as to the
accuracy or completeness of the information herein. The information herein is
preliminary, and will be superseded by the applicable prospectus supplement,
any related supplement and by any other information subsequently filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information herein may not be
provided by the addressees to any third party other than the addressee's
legal, tax, financial and/or accounting advisors for the purposes of
evaluating said material.


Numerous assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which
may or may not be stated therein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
accuracy, appropriateness or completeness of the Computational Materials in
any particular context; or as to whether the Computational Materials and/or
the assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be
construed as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or
accounting advice.


Without limiting the foregoing, the collateral information set forth in these
Computational Materials, including without limitation the collateral tables
which follow, is based only on a statistical pool of Mortgage Loans expected
to be included in the Trust along with other Mortgage Loans on the Closing
Date. In addition, certain Mortgage Loans contained in this statistical pool
may be deleted from the final pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on
the Closing Date. This statistical pool may not necessarily represent a
statistically relevant population, notwithstanding any contrary references
herein. Although Countrywide Securities believes the information with respect
to the statistical pool will be representative of the final pool of Mortgage
Loans, the collateral characteristics of the final pool may nonetheless vary
from the collateral characteristics of the statistical pool.


Any yields or weighted average lives shown in the Computational Materials are
based on prepayment assumptions and actual prepayment experience may
dramatically affect such yields or weighted average lives. In addition, it is
possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur at rates slower
or faster than the rates assumed in the attached Computational Materials.
Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials assume no
losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfall. The specific
characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying
assets and the hypothetical assets used in preparing the Computational
Materials. The principal amount and designation of any security described in
the Computational Materials are subject to change prior to issuance.


Although a registration statement (including the prospectus) relating to the
securities discussed in this communication has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is effective, the final prospectus supplement
relating to the securities discussed in this communication has not been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This communication shall not
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy nor shall
there be any sale of the securities discussed in this communication in any
State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to
registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such State.
Prospective purchasers are referred to the final prospectus and prospectus
supplement relating to the securities discussed in this communication for
definitive Computational Materials on any matter discussed in this
communication. A final prospectus and prospectus supplement may be obtained by
contacting your Countrywide Securities account representative.


Please be advised that asset-backed securities may not be appropriate for all
investors. Potential investors must be willing to assume, among other things,
market price volatility, prepayments, yield curve and interest rate risk.
Investors should fully consider the risk of an investment in these securities.

The Mortgage Loans
- ------------------

Description of
Mortgage Loans:                The Trust will consist of two groups of home equity revolving credit line loans made or
                               to be made in the future under certain home equity revolving credit line loan agreements
                               (the "Group 1 Mortgage Loans", "Group 2 Mortgage Loans", and each, a "Loan Group"). The
                               Group 1 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds of trust or mortgages on primarily
                               one-to-four family residential properties with conforming loan balances based on maximum
                               credit limits and will bear interest at rates that adjust based on the prime rate. The
                               Group 2 Mortgage Loans will be secured by second deeds of trust or mortgages on primarily
                               one-to-four family residential properties and will bear interest at rates that adjust
                               based on the prime rate. The original principal balance of each class of Notes will
                               exceed the aggregate Cut-off Date principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related
                               Loan Group transferred to the Trust on the closing date.

                               The actual pool of Mortgage Loans delivered to the Trust on the Closing Date is expected
                               to have a Cut-off Date Balance of at least $1,467.65 million (subject to a variance of
                               +/- 10%). The information presented in these Computational Materials for the Mortgage
                               Loans, particularly in the collateral tables, which follow, reflects a statistical pool
                               of Mortgage Loans as of October 29, 2004. However, the characteristics of the statistical
                               pool are expected to be representative of the final pool of Mortgage Loans actually
                               delivered to the Trust on the Closing Date.

HELOC Amortization:            The Mortgage Loans are adjustable rate, home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") which may
                               be drawn upon generally for a period (the "Draw Period") of five (5) years (which, in
                               most cases, may be extendible for an additional five (5) years with Countrywide's
                               approval). HELOCs are generally subject to a fifteen (15) year repayment period following
                               the end of the Draw Period during which the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage
                               Loan will be repaid in monthly installments equal to 1/180 of the outstanding principal
                               balance as of the end of the Draw Period. A relatively small number of HELOCs are subject
                               to a five (5), ten (10) or twenty (20) year repayment period following the Draw Period
                               during which the outstanding principal balance of the loan will be repaid in equal
                               monthly installments. None of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans require a balloon repayment at
                               the end of the Draw Period and approximately 0.04% of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans require
                               a balloon repayment at the end of the Draw Period.

Cut-off Date Balance:          The aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date.


The Notes
- ---------

Description
of the Notes:                  The Class 1-A and Class 2-A Notes (together, the "Notes") will be issued by
                               CWABS Revolving Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2004-R (the "Trust"). As of the Closing
                               Date, the aggregate principal balance of both classes of the Notes will be $1,490,000,000
                               (subject to a permitted variance of +/- 10%).

Federal Tax Status:            It is anticipated that the Notes will be treated as debt instruments for federal income
                               tax purposes.

Registration:                  The Notes will be available in book-entry form through DTC, Clearstream and the Euroclear
                               System.

Note Rate:                     Except as noted below, each class of Notes will accrue interest during each Interest
                               Accrual Period at a rate equal to the least of: (a) one-month LIBOR, plus 0.28%, (b) the
                               Net WAC of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group, and (c) 16.00%. With respect to
                               the initial Interest Accrual Period only, the rate calculated in clause (a) above will be
                               based on an interpolated mid-point LIBOR (using the 1-month and 2-month LIBOR as
                               benchmarks).

Net WAC:                       The "Net WAC" of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans shall mean the weighted
                               average of the loan rates of the Group 1 or Group 2 Mortgage Loans (as applicable),
                               weighted on the basis of the daily average balance of each Mortgage Loan in the
                               applicable Loan Group during the related billing cycle before the Collection Period
                               relating to the Payment Date, net of the Expense Fee Rate.

Expense Fee Rate:              For any Payment Date, the "Expense Fee Rate" shall be an amount equal to the sum of (i)
                               the servicing fee rate, (ii) the note insurer premium rate times a fraction, the
                               numerator of which is

Basis Risk Carryforward:       On any Payment Date the "Basis Risk Carryforward" for either Class of Notes will equal,

                                  described below) for previous Payment Dates, to the extent not covered by Investor
                                  Interest Collections related to the Group 1 Mortgage Loans and not previously

                              11. Payment to the Master Servicer of amounts for which the Master Servicer is entitled

                               1. During the Managed Amortization Period (as described below), the amount of principal
                                  payable to the holder of a class of Notes for each Payment Date will equal, to the
                                  extent funds are available from the related Loan Group, the lesser of (a) the product
                                  of (i) the Investor Fixed Allocation Percentage (as defined below) for those Notes,
                                  and (ii) principal collections from the related Loan Group relating to such Payment

                                  The "Managed Amortization Period" for each class of Notes shall mean the period beginning
                                  on the Closing Date and, unless a Rapid Amortization Event (i.e., certain events of
                                  default or other material non-compliance by the Sponsor under the terms of the related
                                  transaction documents) shall have earlier occurred, through and including the Payment
                                  Date in January 2010.

                                  The "Investor Fixed Allocation Percentage" for any Payment Date and each Class of Notes
                                  will be calculated as follows: (i) on any date on which the related Allocated
                                  Transferor Interest is less than the related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount,
                                  100%, and (ii) on any date on which the related Allocated Transferor Interest equals
                                  or exceeds the related Required Transferor Subordinated Amount, 98.55% for the Class
                                  1-A Notes and 98.10% for the Class 2-A Notes.

                               2. After the Managed Amortization Period, the amount of principal payable to the holders
                                  of each class of Notes will be equal to the related Maximum Principal Payment.

Optional Termination:          The Notes may be retired as a result of the owner of the Transferor Interest
                               purchasing all of the mortgage loans then included in the trust estate on any payment
                               date on or after which the aggregate principal balance of both classes of Notes is less
                               than or equal to 10% of the initial aggregate principal balance of the Notes of both
                               classes.

Credit Enhancement:            The Trust will include the following mechanisms, each of which is intended to provide
                               credit support for the Notes:

                               1. Excess Interest Collections. For any Loan Group, its Excess Interest Collections are
                                  the related investor interest collections minus the sum of (a) the interest paid to
                                  the related class of Notes, (b) the servicing fee retained by the Master Servicer for
                                  the Mortgage Loans in that Loan Group, and (c) the premium paid to the Note Insurer
                                  allocable to that Loan Group. Investor Interest Collections from a Loan Group will be
                                  available to cover losses on the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group first and
                                  then, if necessary, in the unrelated Loan Group.

                               2. Limited Subordination of Transferor Interest (Overcollateralization). A portion of the
                                  Allocated Transferor Interest related to each Loan Group will be available to provide
                                  limited protection against Investor Loss Amounts in such Loan Group (as defined below)
                                  up to the Available Transferor Subordinated Amount for such Loan Group. The "Available
                                  Transferor Subordinated Amount" for each Loan Group is, for any Payment Date, the
                                  lesser of the related Allocated Transferor Interest and the related Required
                                  Transferor Subordinated Amount. The "Allocated Transferor Interest" for any date of
                                  determination, will equal (a) the related Loan Group Balance of the related Loan Group
                                  at the close of business on the prior day, minus (b) the Note Principal Balance of the
                                  class of Notes related to that Loan Group (after giving effect to the distribution of
                                  all amounts actually distributed on that class of Notes on that date). Subject to any
                                  step-down or step-up as may be permitted or required by the transaction documents, the
                                  "Required Transferor Subordinated Amount" (x) for the Group 1 Mortgage Loans will be
                                  (i) prior to the date on which the step-down occurs, 1.45% of the Cut-off Date Balance
                                  of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans and (ii) on or after the date on which the step-down
                                  occurs and so long as a trigger event is not in effect, 2.90% of the then current
                                  unpaid principal balance of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans (subject to a floor equal to
                                  0.50% of the Cut-off Date Balance of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans) and (y) for the Group
                                  2 Mortgage Loans will be (i) prior to the date on which the step-down occurs, 1.90% of
                                  the Cut-off Date Balance of the Group 2

                               Mortgage Loans and (ii) on or after the date on which the step-down occurs and as long as
                               a trigger event is not in effect, 3.80% if the then current unpaid principal balance
                               of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans (subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the Cut-off Date
                               Balance of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans). The Allocated Transferor Interest for each
                               Loan Group will be less than zero on the Closing Date.

                               The initial aggregate principal balance of each class of Notes will exceed the aggregate
                               Cut-off Date principal balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group
                               transferred to the issuer on the closing date. This excess represents an
                               undercollateralization of approximately 1.50% of the original principal balance of the
                               Notes.

                               3. Surety Wrap. XL Capital will issue a note insurance policy, which will guarantee the
                                  timely payment of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal to the holders of
                                  the Notes. The policy does not cover payment of Basis Risk Carryforward.

Investor Loss Amounts:         With respect to any Payment Date and each Class of Notes, the amount equal to the product
                               of (a) the applicable Investor Floating Allocation Percentage (as defined below) for such
                               Payment Date and such Class of Notes, and (b) the aggregate of the Liquidation Loss
                               Amounts for such Payment Date from Mortgage Loans in the relevant Loan Group. The
                               "Investor Floating Allocation Percentage," for any Payment Date and each Loan Group shall
                               be the lesser of 100% and a fraction, the numerator of which is the related Note
                               Principal Balance and the denominator of which is the Loan Group Balance of the related
                               Mortgage Loans at the beginning of the related Collection Period. The "Loan Group
                               Balance" for each Loan Group and any date is the aggregate of the principal balances of
                               the related Mortgage Loans as of such date. "Liquidation Loss Amounts" for any liquidated
                               Mortgage Loan and any Payment Date is the unrecovered principal balance of such Mortgage
                               Loan at the end of the Collection Period in which such Mortgage Loan became a liquidated
                               Mortgage Loan, after giving effect to its net liquidation proceeds.

ERISA Eligibility:             Subject to the considerations in the prospectus supplement, the Notes are xpected to be
                               eligible for purchase by certain ERISA plans. Prospective investors must review the
                               related prospectus and prospectus supplement and consult with their professional advisors
                               for a more detailed description of these matters prior to investing in the Notes.

SMMEA Treatment:               The Notes will not constitute "mortgage related securities" for purposes of SMMEA.
