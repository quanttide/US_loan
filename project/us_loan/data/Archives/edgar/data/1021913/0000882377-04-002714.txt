                                             by the Underwriter to certain

Item 8.01                  Other Events.
                           ------------

         On or about December 27, 2004, the Registrant will cause the issuance
and sale of approximately $761,052,000 initial principal amount of Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-BC5 (collectively, the "Certificates") pursuant to a
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2004, among the
Registrant, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., as Seller, Countrywide Home Loans
Servicing LP, as Master Servicer and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.

         In connection with the sale of the Series 2004-BC5 Class A-1, Class
A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class
M-6, Class M-7, Class M-8 and Class B Certificates (the "Underwritten
Certificates"), the Registrant has been advised by Countrywide Securities
Corporation (the "Underwriter") that the Underwriter has furnished to
prospective investors certain yield tables and other computational materials
(the "Computational Materials") with respect to the Underwritten Certificates
following the effective date of Registration Statement 333-118926, which
Computational Materials are being filed as exhibits to this report.

         The Computational Materials have been provided by the Underwriter. The
information in the Computational Materials is preliminary and may be superseded
by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Underwritten Certificates and by
any other information subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

         The Computational Materials were prepared by the Underwriter at the
request of certain prospective investors, based on assumptions provided by, and
satisfying the special requirements of, such prospective investors. The
Computational Materials may be based on assumptions that differ from the
assumptions set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. The Computational Materials
may not include, and do not purport to include, information based on assumptions
representing a complete set of possible scenarios. Accordingly, the
Computational Materials may not be relevant to or appropriate for investors
other than those specifically requesting them.

         In addition, the actual characteristics and performance of the mortgage
loans underlying the Underwritten Certificates (the "Mortgage Loans") may differ
from the assumptions used in the Computational Materials, which are hypothetical
in nature and which were provided to certain investors only to give a general
sense of how the yield, average life, duration, expected maturity, interest rate
sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of a particular class of Underwritten
Certificates might vary under varying prepayment and other scenarios. Any
difference between such assumptions and the actual characteristics and
performance of the Mortgage Loans will affect the actual yield, average life,
duration, expected maturity, interest rate sensitivity and cash flow
characteristics of the Underwritten Certificates.
