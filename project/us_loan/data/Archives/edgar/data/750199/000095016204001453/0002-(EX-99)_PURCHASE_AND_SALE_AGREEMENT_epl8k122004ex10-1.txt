      with its principal office at 201 St. Charles Avenue, Suite 3400, New
      Orleans, Louisiana 70170 (collectively "Buyer").

     In consideration of the provisions below and other good and valuable cause
and consideration, the receipt, adequacy and validity of all of which are
acknowledged and confirmed, Seller and Buyer agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1.
                      Purchase and Sale; Purchase Price and
                            Adjustments; Accounting.

     1.1 Purchase and Sale. At the Closing, effective as of the Effective Time
and subject to the provisions herein, Seller shall sell and convey the Subject
Interests to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase, pay for and accept the Subject
Interests from Seller.

     1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Subject Interests is One
Hundred Fifty Million and No/100 United States Dollars ($150,000,000.00) (the
"Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment in accordance with this Agreement. Upon
executing this Agreement, Buyer shall pay by wire transfer in immediately
available funds delivered to the following account the sum of Five Million and
No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) (the "Deposit"). At Closing, Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid the remainder of the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment in

                           Acct. Holder       Castex Energy, Inc.

     1.3 Purchase Price Adjustment. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
follows (the Purchase Price as so adjusted, the "Adjusted Purchase Price").
Nonetheless, even if any single item of income or expense can be categorized
under more than one of the following categories, such item shall be counted only
once for purposes of making adjustments to the Purchase Price. The Purchase
Price shall be adjusted in accordance with this Section 1.3, but,

<PAGE>

notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, shall not be adjusted

interpretations of reserves and (iii) the condition of the Equipment.

          (a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following
     amounts:

               1) the amount of all expenditures actually paid by Seller in
          connection with the operation of the Assets which are, in accordance
          with GAAP, attributable to the period of time after the Effective
          Time, including without limitation royalties, rentals and other
          charges; ad valorem, property, production, excise, severance, and any
          other Taxes (other than income Taxes) based upon or measured by the
          ownership of property or the production of Hydrocarbons or the receipt
          of proceeds therefrom, in each case attributable to the Assets and not
          deducted or netted from proceeds under Section 1.3(b), as well as
          expenses properly incurred under applicable operating agreements,
          including any charges incurred by Seller as a non-operator, including
          without limitation geological and land costs and costs of drilling,
          testing, treating, completing, reworking, deepening, side-tracking,
          and plugging and abandoning wells;

               2) the amount of (i) gross proceeds actually received by Buyer,
          or offset by third parties against amounts owed by Buyer, from the
          sale of Hydrocarbons that are produced from or attributable to the
          Assets prior to the Effective Time, net of royalties that are owed to
          a Third Person, severance taxes, and marketing costs (including
          without limitation transportation, compression, gathering and
          processing fees) not reimbursed to Buyer or Seller by the purchaser of
          such Hydrocarbons, and (ii) any other income and proceeds actually
          received by Buyer, or offset by third parties against amounts owed by
          Buyer, with respect to the Assets, which are, in accordance with GAAP,
          attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time;

               3) the value of all Hydrocarbons in storage as of the Effective
          Time that is credited to the Assets, such value to be the actual price
          received for such Hydrocarbons upon the first sale thereof, or absent
          a sale, then such value shall be based upon the average market price
          posted in the area for Hydrocarbons of similar quality and grade in
          effect as of the Effective Time, in each case net of royalties that
          are owed to a Third Person, severance taxes, and marketing costs
          (including without limitation transportation, compression, gathering
          and processing fees) not reimbursed by the purchaser of such
          Hydrocarbons;

               4) all Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under Section 9.11,
          to the extent they are paid by or on behalf of Seller;

               5) the amount for any underproduced gas position of Seller as

               6) the amount of the Negative Balance Suspense Accounts as of the
          Effective Time;

               7) all additional amounts mutually agreed upon in writing by
          Buyer and Seller; and

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

               8) an amount equal to the sum of any Upward Adjustment provided
          for in Section 4.9.

     (b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts:

          1) all revenues and related receivables (i) paid to Seller before it
     submits its Final Accounting Settlement under Section 1.6(a) and (ii)
     related to or arising out of the ownership, operation or use of the Subject
     Interests at or after the Effective Time;

          2) all amounts due by Seller under any Contract that (i) are
     attributable to the ownership, operation or use of any Subject Interest
     before the Effective Time, (ii) are paid by Buyer and (iii) are identified
     by Buyer to Seller before Seller submits its Final Accounting Settlement
     under Section 1.6(a);

          3) the amount of any overproduced gas position of Seller as described
     in Section 1.4(a);

          4) the Downward Defect Adjustment (subject to the provisions of
     Section 4.7(b));

          5) the Allocated Amount of any Subject Interests deemed "Excluded
     Assets" under Section 4.10(a) (except as provided in and subject to Section
     4.10(b) or Section 4.11(c);

          6) any Purchase Price adjustment agreed to by the Buyer and Seller
     pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.2(b); and

          7) all additional amounts mutually agreed in writing to by Buyer and
     Seller.

          1.4 Gas Imbalances. To the best of Seller's Knowledge, the volume of
any gas imbalance of Seller with respect to the Subject Interests, Leases, Wells
and Units as of the Effective Time and whether at the wellhead, platform or
otherwise are set forth on Exhibit "M" hereto (collectively the "Imbalance").

     (a) If pursuant to the Imbalance any gas volumes are due and owing by
Seller to one or more underproduced Persons as of the Effective Time, Seller
shall pay to Buyer (or credit Buyer for) an amount equal to the product of the
Imbalance Price times such volume (in MMBtu's), net of any royalties, overriding
royalties or other burdens, in order to reflect the estimated value and
liability of such overproduction as of the Effective Time.

     (b) If pursuant to the Imbalance any gas volumes are due and owing to
Seller by one or more overproduced Persons as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to the product of the Imbalance Price times such
volume (in MMBtu's), net of any royalties, overriding royalties or other
burdens, in order to reflect the estimated value and liability of such
underproduction as of the Effective Time.

     The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Imbalance reflects the
estimated amount of any gas imbalance owed to or by Seller and (b) the Imbalance
Price reflects their estimated value of any underproduced or overproduced gas


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

position of Seller in connection with any Subject Interest as of the Effective
Time, net of royalties, Taxes, overriding royalties and other burdens.

     1.5 Preliminary Accounting Statement. At least three (3) Business Days
before the anticipated Closing, Seller shall prepare and present to Buyer a
"Preliminary Accounting Statement" reflecting all then-applicable upward and
downward adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided in Section 1.3,
determined in accordance with GAAP as used in the oil and gas industry and using
the best information then available. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disputes involving the Preliminary Accounting Statement. To
the extent that the parties do not agree to any such amounts at or before
Closing, such amounts shall be accounted for in, and in accordance with, the
Final Accounting Settlement.

     1.6 Final Accounting Settlement.

     (a) Within ninety (90) Days after Closing but not earlier than sixty (60)
days after Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Final
Accounting Settlement") setting forth (1) a detailed calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price and (2) the net amount owing by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to
Seller, as appropriate.

     (b) Within thirty (30) Days after Buyer receives the Final Accounting
Settlement, Buyer may submit to Seller a written notice (an "Objection Notice")
that (1) sets forth each item in Seller's Final Accounting Settlement that Buyer
contends does not comply with this Agreement, (2) provides the basis for each
such objection, (3) provides supporting documentation for each such objection
and (4) sets forth, based on all such objections, both the amount that Buyer
contends equals the Adjusted Purchase Price and the net amount that Buyer
contends is owing by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller, as appropriate. If
Buyer does not timely deliver an Objection Notice in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the Final Accounting Settlement, in the form delivered by
Seller, shall be deemed to be true and correct and shall be final and binding on
the parties.

     (c) If Buyer timely delivers an Objection Notice in accordance herewith,
the parties shall use reasonable efforts to meet as soon as reasonably
practicable to attempt to resolve all objections set forth in the Objection
Notice.

     (d) If the parties fail to amicably resolve each objection in a timely
Objection Notice, the disputed items in the Final Accounting Settlement shall be
resolved by submitting the same to the Referee in Houston, Texas. But no
objection shall be submitted to the Referee until at least twenty (20) Business
Days after the meeting prescribed in Section 1.6(c). Each party giving any
notice or submission to the Referee shall simultaneously provide a copy thereof
to the other party. The Referee shall resolve the dispute(s) within twenty (20)
Business Days after having the relevant materials submitted for review. The
Referee shall act as an arbitrator for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed matters submitted by either party and may not award damages or
penalties to either party with respect to any matter. The decision of the
Referee shall be binding on the parties and non-appealable. In determining the
proper amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Referee shall not fix the
Adjusted Purchase Price at an amount more than the amount proposed by Seller in
its Final Accounting Settlement nor at an amount less than the amount proposed


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

by Buyer in its Objection Notice. The Referee shall not consider any objection
to Seller's Final Accounting Settlement that is not set forth in a timely
Objection Notice. Each party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. The fees and expenses of the Referee shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller; each party shall
pay its proportionate share of the Referee's fees and expenses within ten (10)
Business Days of the later of (a) the date when the Referee's decision is issued
or (b) the receipt by such party of an itemized statement of such fees and
expenses.

     (e) Within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price (whether by agreement or deemed agreement between the
parties or by decision of the Referee), each party shall pay all net amounts
reflected in the Final Accounting Settlement as being due and payable to the
other party. Such net amounts shall bear legal interest from and after, but not
before, such due date.

     1.7 Allocation. The Allocated Amounts (which shall be mutually agreed upon
by the parties) are to be used solely (a) to adjust the Purchase Price in
accordance with Title Defects, Environmental Defects and Preferential Rights. To
the extent that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, the parties will confer and cooperate in the preparation and filing
of their respective federal and state tax reporting forms to reflect a
consistent reporting of the agreed upon allocation.

                                   ARTICLE 2.

     NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING IN THIS SECTION 4.4, BUYER IS EXPRESSLY
ENTITLED TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY SELLER EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN ARTICLE 2 AND THE SPECIAL AND LIMITED TITLE WARRANTY AND SHALL BE
ENTITLED TO ALL AVAILABLE RECOURSE SHOULD ANY OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES BE INACCURATE, SUBJECT, HOWEVER, TO APPLICABLE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH
IN ARTICLE 9 BELOW. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN ANY
PROVISION OF THIS SECTION 4.4 AND ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
PROVISION OF ANY ASSIGNMENT, SUCH OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR PROVISION
OF AN ASSIGNMENT SHALL CONTROL.

     4.5 Disclaimer Regarding Lands.

     (a) Buyer expressly acknowledges that Buyer is aware that the Lands are
largely marsh lands, and there are numerous water covered areas within the
boundaries of such lands, which may be susceptible to a claim by the State of
Louisiana that the beds of such water covered areas are owned by the State of
Louisiana as the beds of navigable waterbodies. Seller does hereby exclude any
contractual, implied or other warranty or representation regarding whether water
covered areas are navigable or not navigable, and whether the beds of such water
covered areas are owned by Seller or, alternatively, owned by the State of
Louisiana; provided, however, nothing contained in these statements is intended
to limit in any manner Buyer's right to dispute any claim of ownership which may
be asserted, in litigation or otherwise, by the State of Louisiana respecting
any claim to the ownership of the beds of water covered areas, and Buyer's right
to assert that the beds of such water covered areas are owned by Buyer because
such water covered areas are, in fact, not navigable.

     (b) Buyer further acknowledges that Seller has made no representations or
shall be making no warranties concerning the acreage content and/or depth
restrictions of Seller's interest in the Lands, regarding the location of the
boundaries of the Lands, concerning any encroachments upon the Lands, regarding
the existence of Seller's rights in the Lands (including but not limited to the
term(s) of Seller's rights) and the application of the laws of liberative
prescription thereto, and especially that Seller has made no representations or
warranties concerning whether portions of the Lands may have eroded into or
subsided beneath adjacent water covered areas (and hence such areas may have
become subject to a claim of ownership by the State of Louisiana).

     4.6 Title Defects. By written notice delivered to Seller during the period
commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at 11:59 p.m. Central Time
on January 8, 2005 (the "Objection Period") (each such timely notice, a "Title
Defect Notice"), Buyer may notify Seller of the existence of any matter that it
believes constitutes a Title Defect. To constitute a proper Title Defect Notice,
such notice must include with respect to each asserted Title Defect (1) the
nature of, and a detailed legal explanation with respect to, such Title Defect,
(2) a description of each Scheduled Interest affected, (3) the Allocated Amount
of each such Scheduled Interest, (4) the amount by which Buyer believes such
Allocated Amount has been reduced as a result of such Title Defect (which amount
must comply with Section 4.8), (5) the computations and information upon which
Buyer's belief is based and (6) supporting documentation necessary for Seller to
analyze Buyer's computations and the existence and amount of such Title Defect.


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

If and when Buyer believes that a Title Defect may exist, Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts to notify Seller of such possible Title Defect and furnish
available information concerning such possible Title Defect and, from time to
time thereafter as Buyer obtains more information, shall provide Seller, as soon
as practicable, with such additional information.

     4.7 Seller's Election to Cure. As to each Scheduled Interest for which
Buyer asserts an alleged Title Defect in a Title Defect Notice during the
Objection Period, the following provisions shall apply:

     (a) If Seller agrees to the existence of a Title Defect, Seller may elect
to cure any Title Defect. A Title Defect shall be deemed cured if Seller
delivers to Buyer curative material that, in Buyer's judgment, is sufficient to
cure the Title Defect. Such material delivered by 11:59 p.m. on January 13, 2005
shall be deemed sufficient and acceptable to Buyer unless by 5:00 p.m. on
January 17, 2005 Seller receives from Buyer written notice that the curative is
not acceptable.

     (b) If Seller fails to cure a Title Defect in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.7(a), notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Purchase Price shall not be reduced for a Title Defect (i) unless the
Downward Defect Adjustment (as determined in accordance with the provisions of
Section 4.8) for such Title Defect exceeds Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($50,000) or (ii) unless and until the aggregate of all such Downward Defect
Adjustments (which satisfy subpart (a)) exceeds $200,000.00 (which amount shall
be a threshold, not a deductible). As to any asserted Title Defect for which
there is no reduction of the Purchase Price by virtue of the preceding sentence,
for which Seller cures same, or for which there is a reduction in the Purchase
Price or, (x) Seller shall have no further obligation with respect to such Title
Defect, (y) Buyer shall be deemed to have waived such Title Defect and (z) the
Subject Interest shall be conveyed to Buyer subject to such Title Defect.

     (c) At Closing, Seller may add to Exhibit "D" and Exhibit "E" hereto any
assignments or other agreements or instruments obtained, and any textual changes
necessary, (a) to cure any Title Defect and (b) to reflect any additional
Excluded Assets under this Section.

     4.8 Downward Defect Adjustment. The value attributable to such uncured
Title Defects ("Downward Defect Adjustment") shall be determined as follows:

               1) Where Seller agrees with the value of the Title Defect as set
          forth in Buyer's Title Defect Notice, that value shall be the value of
          the Title Defect.

               2) If the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge
          upon the Scheduled Interest which is undisputed and liquidated in
          amount, then the Downward Defect Adjustment shall be the amount
          necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the Title Defect from
          Buyer's proportionate interest in the affected Scheduled Interest;
          provided, however, that if the Title Defect affects more than Seller's
          interest in the affected Scheduled Interest, then the value of the
          Title Defect will be reduced proportionately to the extent of Seller's
          interest in the affected Scheduled Interest.

               3) If the Title Defect represents a uniform discrepancy for the
          entire Scheduled Interest for the life of same from the net revenue
          interest for any Schedule Interest stated on Exhibit "H", then the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

          Downward Defect Adjustment for such Title Defect shall be the product
          of the Allocated Amount of such Scheduled Interest on Exhibit "H"
          multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue
          interest decrease and the denominator of which is the net revenue
          interest stated on Exhibit "H".

               4) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance,
          burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Scheduled
          Interest of a type not described in subsections (1), (2) or (3) above,
          the Downward Defect Adjustment for the Title Defect shall be
          determined by taking into account the Allocated Amount of the
          Scheduled Interest so affected, the portion of the Scheduled Interest
          affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
          the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
          affected Scheduled Interest, and such other factors as are necessary
          to make a proper evaluation.

     Buyer and Seller agree that in no event shall a Downward Defect Adjustment
for a Scheduled Interest exceed the Allocated Amount thereof.

     4.9 Upward Adjustments.

     (a) If, during the Review Period, either Seller or Buyer determines that
there is any inaccuracy that results in Seller conveying or assigning to Buyer
at Closing a net revenue interest in a Scheduled Interest which is higher than
that reflected on Exhibit "H", such party shall, as soon as practicable, notify
the other party of such inaccuracy (an "Additional Interest"). Such notice shall
include: (i) a description of the affected Scheduled Interest (or interest
therein or portion thereof); and (ii) a description of the Additional Interest
with supporting documentation. If Buyer agrees that the net revenue interest in
such Scheduled Interest is higher and desires to purchase such Additional
Interest, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: in the event of
the identification of an Additional Interest, Seller and Buyer shall endeavor in
good faith to agree upon the amount of such increase in value occasioned by such
inaccuracy which, for increases in net revenue interest, shall be based upon the
proportionate increase in the net revenue interest multiplied by the Allocated
Amount of such Scheduled Interests. The full amount of increased value
attributable to the sum of the Additional Interest is called an "Upward
Adjustment." If Buyer does not desire to purchase the Additional Interest, then
such Additional Interest shall be retained by Seller. If necessary, the parties
shall enter into such additional agreements and instruments as are required to
affect such exclusion of such Additional Interests from the transfer of the
Assets. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.9(a) to the contrary, no
Upward Adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price if the corresponding
Working Interest for the affected Scheduled Interest increases by an amount
greater than the Additional Interest.

     (b) The aggregate amount of Upward Adjustments under the preceding
subsection (a) shall be applied to increase the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 1.3(a)(7).

     4.10 Preferential Rights. Seller shall send to the holder of each right
listed in Exhibit "O" (each a "Preferential Right") written notice offering to
sell to such holder, in accordance with the contractual provisions applicable to
such Preferential Right, such Subject Interest on the terms of this Agreement
and for the total Allocated Amount for such Subject Interest. Seller shall
deliver to Buyer copies of all such notices and any responses thereto.





                                      -15-
<PAGE>

     (a) If, before Closing, a holder of a Preferential Right notifies Seller
that it intends to exercise its Preferential Right with respect to a Subject
Interest to which the Preferential Right applies (as determined in accordance
with the agreement in which the Preferential Right arises) or if the election
period for a Preferential Right has not expired before Closing, then subject to
Section 4.10(b), (i) the Subject Interest covered by the Preferential Right
shall be deemed to constitute an "Excluded Asset" and shall be excluded from the
Subject Interests to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and (ii) the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Amount of such Subject Interest.

     (b) If, with one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing, the
holder of the Preferential Right fails to exercise the Preferential Right within
the election period thereunder, or fails to purchase the Subject Interest
subject to the Preferential Right, Seller shall so notify Buyer. Within ten (10)
Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell to Buyer,
and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, such Subject Interest under the terms of
this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Amount thereof (and such
Subject Interest shall no longer constitute an "Excluded Asset" by virtue of
Section 4.10(a)).

     4.11 Consents to Assignment. As between Buyer and Seller, Seller shall be
responsible for exercising reasonable efforts to obtain those necessary consents
and approvals which must be obtained prior to Closing and for giving all
necessary notices of assignment of the Subject Interests from Seller to Buyer
(each a "Consent", which include but are not limited to those on Exhibit "P"
hereto which are customarily obtained prior to Closing). Nonetheless, before and
following Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts (which efforts
shall not require either to incur any monetary or non-monetary obligations) to
obtain these consents and approvals required for, and in giving all notices of,
the transfer of any Subject Interest to Buyer.

     (a) If, before Closing, a Consent has not been obtained, satisfied or
waived (if the parties mutually agree to such waiver), then subject to Sections
4.11(b) and (c), (i) the Subject Interest covered by the Consent shall be deemed
to constitute an "Excluded Asset" and shall be excluded from the Subject
Interests to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and (ii) the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Amount of such Subject Interest.

     (b) If, within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing, the
Consent is obtained or otherwise satisfied, Seller shall so notify Buyer. Within
ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell
to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, such Subject Interest under the
terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Amount thereof (and
such Subject Interest shall no longer constitute an "Excluded Asset" by virtue
of Section 4.11(a)).

     (c) If, before Closing, a Consent concerning an Asset in the South Bourg
Field (which is defined to include all Assets pertaining to the Leases and other
interests described on Exhibit "R" hereto) has not been obtained, satisfied, or
waived (if the parties mutually agree to such waiver) then (i) each and every
Asset pertaining to or covering the South Bourg Field shall be excluded from the
Subject Interests to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and (ii) the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Amount of such Subject Interests.



                                      -16-
<PAGE>

     (d) For any Subject Interest as to which Buyer waives the obtaining of a
Consent at or before Closing, (i) such Subject Interest shall not constitute an
"Excluded Asset"; (ii) the Purchase Price shall not be reduced for any reason
related to such Consent; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Buyer shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold Seller, each prior owner of the
Subject Interest and their Related Persons harmless from and against any Claim
arising out of or related to any failure to obtain such Consent.

     4.12 Casualty Loss. If a Casualty Loss exists at Closing (a) Buyer shall
purchase the Subject Interest affected by the Casualty Loss notwithstanding the
Casualty Loss and without any adjustment to the Purchase Price therefor and (b)
Seller shall at the Closing pay to Buyer any sums paid to Seller by reason of
the Casualty Loss and shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the
right, title and interest of Seller in and to any unpaid insurance proceeds,
awards and other payments for such Casualty Loss.

     4.13 Transfer of Operatorship. Seller makes no representations or
warranties to Buyer as to the transferability (or assignability) of the
operatorship of any Subject Interest or Asset. Buyer acknowledges that the
rights and obligations associated with such operatorship are governed by the
applicable Laws, regulatory authorities and agreement(s) and that such
operatorship following the Closing will be determined in accordance therewith.

                                   ARTICLE 5.
                             Environmental Matters.

     5.1 Environmental Review. Subject to the following provisions and until
5:00 p.m. on January 17, 2005, Buyer may inspect the Assets operated by Seller
and environmental data in Seller's files pertaining to the Assets and at Buyer's
request, Seller shall contact the operators of Assets not operated by Seller to
arrange for review and inspection of such Assets and of the data, information,
documentation, books, and records pertaining thereto (collectively,
"environmental data" for the purposes of this Section 5.1), at Buyer's sole
cost, risk and expense. Buyer specifically acknowledges that (a) any access to
Seller operated Assets or Seller's data is given as an accommodation only, at
Buyer's sole cost, risk and expense; (b) Seller makes no representations
whatsoever as to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any such
environmental data or information derived from Buyer's review and inspection, or
otherwise disclosed to or obtained by Buyer; and (c) Buyer relies and depends on
and uses any and all such environmental and information derived from Buyer's
review or inspection exclusively and entirely at its own risk and without any
recourse to Seller whatsoever. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to facilitate
the performance by Buyer of any environmental testing that Buyer wishes to
conduct at Buyer's sole cost and risk prior to Closing, which testing shall be
conducted in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Seller's or
operator's operation of the Assets, and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to
ensure that such testing is performed on an expedited and confidential basis
before Closing. Results of any such tests shall be treated as confidential,
except to the extent disclosure is required under applicable Law.

     (a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Related Persons from any and
all Claims caused by, occurring from or in association with, arising out of or
resulting from the activities of Buyer or any of its Related Persons in
connection with said site visits and physical investigations of the Assets

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

(including without limitation Claims for injury to or death of any individual or
for damage to or contamination of any property, natural resources or the
environment), even if such indemnified act, omission, event or occurrence is
caused in whole or in part by the negligence, fault or strict liability of any
Seller, but not to the extent that any such indemnified event or occurrence is
caused by or the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller.

     (b) In addition to the foregoing indemnification obligations, Buyer assumes
full responsibility for all damage to the Assets and/or to operations conducted
by Seller or other operators associated with the Assets that is caused by,
results from or arises from the activities of Buyer or its Related Persons in
connection with said site visits and physical investigations of the Assets
(including without limitation environmental remediation and response costs and
damage to natural resources located on, in, under or above any real property
that is part of or associated with the Assets), even if such damage is caused
by, results from or arises out of the negligence, fault or strict liability of
Seller, but not to the extent such damage is caused by, results from, or arises
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller. Upon Seller's
request, Buyer shall immediately reimburse Seller for all such damages.

     (c) Buyer shall provide Seller with at least two (2) Business Days written
notice before its desired date for testing the Assets and at least one (1)
Business Day written notice before its desired time for assessing the Assets and
will specify in the notice the desired locations to be tested or assessed.
Seller will have the right for itself or its designee(s) to be present during
any testing or other assessments and retains the right to prohibit Buyer from
conducting any such testing or assessment, which is not reasonable and customary
in a transaction such as the one contemplated hereby.

     (d) If Buyer undertakes an environmental assessment, both the consultant
(if any consultant is employed) and the scope of the proposed assessment,
including testing protocols, must be approved by Seller before the work may
begin, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and/or delayed. If
Buyer takes samples from the Assets, Seller may require Buyer to split any
sample so that Seller may retain a sufficient split of such sample for its own
testing or use. Buyer shall promptly furnish to Seller a copy of any assessment
resulting from such inspection, including without limitation any reports,
results, data, analyses, results and conclusions thereof (collectively with any
assessment, "Assessment Information").

     (e) Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of any preliminary report and
access to all drafts of all reports and other Assessment Information produced or
obtained by Buyer as a result of any environmental assessment or testing before
a final version of any report is issued. Before the final version of any report
is issued, Seller shall also have a reasonable opportunity to provide Buyer with
comments and additional information, which Buyer agrees to review and consider
before the final version of any report is issued. Upon completion of any final
report, Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such report and any other
written Assessment Information and shall also provide Seller access to all
Assessment Information produced or obtained by Buyer as a result of any
environmental assessment or testing.

     (f) Buyer shall not disclose (or permit any Related Person to disclose) any
Assessment Information, or any information reviewed during such assessment, to
any Third Person without the prior written consent of Seller, unless such
disclosure is required by a lawful subpoena or order of a Governmental

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Authority. In the event disclosure is sought pursuant to a subpoena or order of
a Governmental Authority, Buyer shall (a) notify Seller in writing at least five
(5) days before such disclosure (b) use commercially reasonably efforts to
undertake reasonable efforts to restrict any further disclosure in the form of a
protective order, confidentiality agreement or other similar device; and (c) use
reasonable efforts to assist Seller in any efforts to have, and shall not oppose
any efforts by Seller to have, any such subpoena quashed or any such order
vacated or modified.

If Buyer does not acquire the Assets for any reason, then upon request by Seller
it shall deliver to Seller all Assessment Information and all materials prepared
or obtained by Buyer or any Related Person that constitute or contain any
Assessment Information pertaining to the Assets.

     5.2 Environmental Defects.

     (a) By written notice delivered to Seller during the time period prior to 5
p.m. on January 17, 2005 ("Environmental Objection Period"), Buyer shall notify
Seller if Buyer believes that the environment associated with a Scheduled
Interest contains an "Environmental Defect", which is defined as a violation or
alleged violation of Environmental Laws or if Buyer believes there is an actual
or threatened exposure of any person or natural resource to Wastes to the
extent, as to each individual Environmental Defect, that: (a) prosecution, if
instituted, would be reasonably likely to result in a penalty, fine or damage
payment of One hundred thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) or more, or (b)
performance of corrective work in respect of such Environmental Defect required
by Environmental Laws would be reasonably likely to result in expenditures of
One hundred thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) or more. Such notification
(the "Environmental Defect Notice") shall include: (i) a description of such
Environmental Defect, (ii) a copy of any environmental data pertaining to such
Defect, and (iii) Buyer's calculation of the amount by which such Defects have
diminished the value of the Scheduled Interests, which amount shall be
determined by Buyer in good faith and in a reasonable manner ("Asserted Defect
Value"). The value of all Environmental Defects must exceed one percent (1%) of
the Purchase Price ("Environmental Defect Minimum Threshold") before there shall
be any Purchase Price Adjustment or further action required of Seller under
Section 5.3 with respect to an Environmental Defect.

     (b) As to any Environmental Defect for which there is no further action or
adjustment, (x) Seller shall have no further obligation with respect to such
Environmental Defect, (y) Buyer shall be deemed to have waived such
Environmental Defect and (z) the Subject Interest shall be conveyed to Buyer
subject to such Environmental Defect.

     (c) If and when Buyer believes that an Environmental Defect may exist,
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to notify Seller of such possible
Environmental Defect and furnish available information concerning such possible
Environmental Defect and, from time to time thereafter as Buyer obtains more
information, shall provide Seller, as soon as practicable, with such additional
information.

     5.3 Remedies for Environmental Defect. With respect to each Environmental
Defect asserted by Buyer in an Environmental Defect Notice, if Seller requests,
Seller and Buyer shall discuss and agree whether a particular matter constitutes
an Environmental Defect. As to each claim of an Environmental Defect made by

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

Buyer during the Environmental Objection Period (and upon satisfaction of the
Environmental Defect Minimum Threshold set forth in Section 5.2 above), Buyer
and Seller shall endeavor to agree upon one of the following three options, with
option 5.3(c) being the default selection (subject to Buyer's election to
proceed under Section 5.3(b)) in the event the parties are unable to agree upon
subparts (a) or (b) below:

     (a) Prior to or at Closing, Seller and Buyer may mutually agree in writing
separate and apart from this Agreement that Seller shall correct or make
arrangements for the correction of such Environmental Defect, and Closing shall
proceed without reduction of the Purchase Price and with Seller making such
correction and, subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 9.4 (including
without limitation the provisions limiting this indemnification to any Claims
for which Seller has received a proper Claim Notice in accordance with Section
9.4 within One (1) Year after the Effective Time, defending, indemnifying and
holding Buyer and its Related Persons harmless against all Claims made by a
Third Person attributable to such Environmental Defect; or

     (b) At Buyer's option, Buyer may elect to make corrections of or make
arrangements for the correction of such Environmental Defect after Closing, and
the parties shall proceed to Closing with a reduction of the Purchase Price in
an amount mutually agreed to by the parties and with Buyer defending,
indemnifying and holding Seller and its Related Persons harmless against all
Claims attributable to such Environmental Defect; or

     (c) Buyer shall accept the Assets subject to any such Environmental Defect,
the parties shall proceed to Closing without adjustment of the Purchase Price,
and Seller shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 9.4 (including
without limitation the provisions limiting this defense and indemnification to
any Claims for which Seller has received a proper Claim Notice in accordance
with Section 9.4 within one year after the Closing Date), defend, indemnify and
hold Buyer and its Related Persons harmless against all Claims asserted by a
Third Person with respect to such Environmental Defects, up to, but in no event
to exceed, five percent (5%) of the Adjusted Purchase Price (such amount being
cumulative for any and all claims of Environmental Defect made by Buyer). In the
event of a claim asserted by a Third Person attributable to an Environmental
Defect and a demand for indemnification by Buyer hereunder, Seller reserves the
right to jointly negotiate with Buyer and the agency or party, if any, making
such claim and the right of access to the affected site, the use of temporary
storage and resources at such site, to the full extent held by Buyer, and the
right to perform assessment, removal and remedial operations for such
Environmental Defect, at its cost and risk, and any sums so expended by Seller
shall be a credit against Seller's indemnity obligation, if any, under this
Section 5.3(c).

     Each party shall cooperate with the other party's reasonable corrective
work, and any operations unreasonably interfering with the corrective work shall
cease until correction is completed.

     5.4 Post-Closing Environmental Indemnification by Buyer. As of the Closing,
but subject to the provisions of Sections 5.3(a) and (c), Buyer specifically
assumes and shall be responsible for all environmentally-related duties and
obligations of Seller and its Related Persons with respect to the Assets and
shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller and the Seller's Related
Persons harmless from and against any and all Claims under any Environmental Law


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

(hereafter defined) with respect to the Assets, including without limitation any
environmentally-related duties, conditions and obligations existing prior to or
as of the Effective Time or relating to periods arising before the Effective
Time. The term "Environmental Law(s)" as used here and elsewhere in this
Agreement includes the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C.A. ss.
6901, et seq.; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.A. ss. 9601, et seq.; the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.A.
ss.1251 et seq.; the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.A. ss. 7401, et seq.; the Safe
Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C.A. ss.3001, et seq.; the Toxic Substances Control
Act, 15 U.S.C.A. ss. 2601 et seq.; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C.A.
ss.2701 et seq.; and all rules, regulations and orders adopted under the
foregoing statutes, applicable state statutes addressing similar matters, or
state or federal statutes enacted after the date of this Agreement applicable to
any waste material, produced water, tank bottoms, sludge, or constituents
thereof, radioactive materials (excluding NORM, as defined in Section 5.5), or
hazardous substances (individually or collectively, "Wastes") on or included
with the Assets or the presence, disposal, release or threatened release of all
Wastes on, included with, or emanating from or through the Assets into the
atmosphere or in or upon land or any water course or body of water, whether
above or below the ground, and all other federal, state and local environmental
and oil and gas laws and regulations, as well as all acts, laws, and regulations
amendatory or supplemental thereto.

     5.5 Condition of the Assets and Specific Buyer Indemnification with Respect
to NORM and Other Hazardous Substances. Except and to the extent as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, Buyer specifically assumes the risk of the condition
of the Assets and shall inspect the Assets prior to Closing, or hereby expressly
waives such inspection right, if not timely exercised. Any such inspection, if
made, shall cover, but not be limited to, the physical and environmental
condition, both surface and subsurface, of the Assets. It is expressly
recognized by Buyer that the lands and/or water bottoms, along with surface
facilities and production equipment located thereon, having been used in
connection with oil, gas, and water production, treatment, storage, and disposal
activities, may contain naturally occurring radioactive materials ("NORM"),
asbestos and other hazardous substances as a result of these operations. The
generation, formation, or presence of NORM, asbestos or other hazardous
substances in or on the Assets shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer, and
Buyer and successors of Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller and
Seller's Related Persons harmless from any and all Claims (except and to the
extent otherwise provided in this Agreement), including without limitation,
attorneys fees, court costs, and expenses associated with investigation of
claims, testing and assessment, whether based on any theory of negligence, tort,
breach of contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, regulatory liability
or statutory liability, regardless of the sole, joint or concurrent negligence,
breach of contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, regulatory liability,
statutory liability, or other fault or responsibility of Seller or any other
Person or party in any way arising from, resulting from or related to the
presence of NORM, asbestos or other hazardous substances, whether such NORM,
asbestos or other hazardous substance was in place before or after the Effective
Time. Additionally, Buyer agrees to comply with all provisions of such laws,
orders, rules or regulations applicable to Real Property Interests, such lands
and/or water bottoms, the Wells, and the Equipment.

     5.6 Waiver. Unless raised by proper notice within the applicable time
period set forth in Section 5.2, Buyer waives for all purposes all objections
associated with the environmental, physical, and other condition of the Assets

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

(including Environmental Defects), and Buyer (on behalf of itself and the
Buyer's Related Persons and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any
and all Claims, (except subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3 and
9.4, Claims covered under Seller's indemnities pursuant to Section 5.3 (a) and
(c)), that they may now or hereafter have asserted against Seller associated
with the same.

                                   ARTICLE 6.
                  Pre-Closing Obligations of Seller and Buyer.

     6.1 Pre-Closing Obligations of Seller.

     (a) Operations. During the Interim Period, Seller shall (except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement):

               1) maintain and keep (or in the case of any Subject Interests
          that are operated by a Third Person, use reasonable efforts (which
          efforts shall not require Seller to incur any monetary or non-monetary
          obligations) to cause the operator of such Subject Interests to
          maintain and keep) the Subject Interests in a condition and working
          order consistent with its past practices and fully and timely perform
          all obligations imposed upon Seller (or in the case of any Subject
          Interests that are operated by a Third Person, use reasonable efforts
          (which efforts shall not require Seller to incur any monetary or
          non-monetary obligations) to cause the operator of such Subject
          Interests to perform all obligations imposed on such operator) in
          respect of any Subject Interests, including without limitation payment
          of royalties, shut-in royalties and any and all other required
          payments accruing through the Closing;

               2) pay timely (or in the case of any Scheduled Interests that are
          operated by a Third Person, use all reasonable efforts (which efforts
          shall not require Seller to incur any monetary or non-monetary
          obligations) to cause the operator of such Scheduled Interests to pay
          timely) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
          Scheduled Interests, except to the extent such costs and expenses are
          contested in good faith;

               3) keep in full force and effect insurance (including without
          limitation producing well and producing facilities coverages)
          comparable in amount and scope of coverage to that maintained by
          Seller for the Scheduled Interests at the time of execution of this
          Agreement and in the event of a Casualty Loss to use reasonable
          efforts to pursue such Claim; and

               4) promptly notify Buyer of each Casualty Loss about which Seller
          obtains Knowledge during the Interim Period.

     (b) During the Interim Period, Seller as operator on Buyer's behalf shall
have no liability to Buyer for losses, Claims or damages sustained or
liabilities incurred as a result of such interim operations conducted by Seller
as operator, regardless of the sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict
liability, regulatory liability, statutory liability, breach of contract, breach
of warranty, or other fault or responsibility of Seller or any other person or
party, except only to the extent any such loss, Claim, damage or liability is
caused by, results from or arises out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller. Seller shall not be obligated for any expenditures after
the Effective Time, and shall be entitled to recover any charges and expenses

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

incurred in the course of such interim operations as part of the Final
Accounting Settlement, including without limitation those items set forth in
Exhibit "K" hereto.

     (c) Refrain from Certain Actions. During the Interim Period, and except as
provided on Exhibits "G-1", "G-2" and "K" Seller shall refrain from taking (or
in the case of any Subject Interests operated by a Third Person, use reasonable
efforts (which efforts shall not require Seller to incur any monetary or
non-monetary obligations) to prevent such operator from taking) any of the
following actions without the prior written consent of Buyer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld):

accept such substitute prospect(s). If by the close of business on January 17,
2005 Buyer has not agreed to accept such substitute prospect(s) then Buyer shall
provide written notice to Seller of Termination.

     8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect
except as follows:

     (a) the provisions of this Article 8, and Sections 2.5, 3.5, 5.1 and 6.2(c)

     (d) if Seller terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(d)
or for failure of the conditions stated in Section 7.1(a) or 7.1(b), then (1)

     9.4 Procedure for Claims. The following provisions shall apply for a party
(a "Claimant") to assert a Claim under or arising out of this Agreement or any
Assignment (whether for protection, indemnity, defense, warranty, breach of this
Agreement or otherwise) against the other party (the "Respondent"). The
following provisions shall also apply for a Related Person of a party (also, a
"Claimant") to assert a Claim under or arising out of this Agreement or any
Assignment for protection, indemnity or defense.

     (a) To assert a Claim, the Claimant shall give to the Respondent a written
notice (a "Claim Notice") that includes (1) the specific details of the Claim
and (2) specific basis under this Agreement for the Claim. In the event that the
Claim is by a Third Person against the Claimant (a "Third Person Claim"), the
Claimant shall submit its Claim Notice promptly after the Claimant has actual
knowledge of the Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served or otherwise received with respect to the Third Person Claim.
Nonetheless, the failure of a party or any of its Related Persons to give notice
of a Third Person Claim as required by this Section 9.4(a) shall not relieve the
other party of its defense and indemnity obligations under this ARTICLE 9 except
to the extent such failure materially prejudices the other party's ability to
defend effectively against the Third Person Claim.

     (b) In the case of a Claim based upon a Third Person Claim, the Respondent
shall notify the Claimant within ten (10) Business Days from Respondent's
receipt of the Claim Notice whether the Respondent admits or denies its
obligation to indemnify and defend the Claimant against the Third Person Claim.
If the Respondent does not notify the Claimant within such ten (10) Business Day
period whether the Respondent admits or denies its obligation, the Claims for
which the Claimant is seeking indemnity and defense shall be conclusively deemed
an obligation of the Respondent hereunder. The Claimant is authorized, prior to
and during such ten (10) Business Day period, to file any paper (and take any
action) that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests.

     (c) If the Respondent admits, or is deemed to have admitted, its obligation
to indemnify and defend the Claimant against the Third Person Claim, it shall
defend diligently, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Person Claim and
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including without
limitation any compromise or settlement thereof, [subject, however, to the
limitations set forth below in this Section 9.4(c)]. If requested by the
Respondent, the Claimant shall cooperate with any actions reasonably necessary
to contest any Third Person Claim that the Respondent elects to contest
(provided, however, that no Claimant shall be required to bring any counterclaim
or cross-complaint against any Person). A Claimant may at its sole cost and
expense participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third
Person Claim controlled by the Respondent. Without the written consent of the
Claimant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Respondent shall
not settle any Third Person Claim against a Claimant or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto that (1) does not result in a final resolution
of the Claimant's liability with respect to the Third Person Claim (including
without limitation, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written
release of the Claimant), (2) imposes on the Claimant any material non-financial
obligation, or any financial obligation outside the scope of the Respondent's
indemnity obligations under this Agreement or (3) imposes on the Claimant a
financial obligation that the Respondent is unable or unwilling to immediately
satisfy.

<PAGE>

     (d) If the Respondent does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim, then
the Claimant shall have the right to defend against the Third Person Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Respondent, with counsel of the Claimant's
choosing, reserving to the Claimant all rights granted hereunder or otherwise
against the Respondent, but subject to the right of the Respondent to admit its
obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person Claim at any time prior to
settlement or final determination thereof. If the Respondent has not yet
admitted its obligation for indemnity and defense with respect to a Third Person
Claim, the Claimant shall send written notice to the Respondent of any proposed
settlement and the Respondent shall have the option for five (5) Business Days
following receipt of such notice to (1) admit in writing its obligation for
indemnity and defense with respect to such Third Person Claim and (2) if its
obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Third Person Claim,
including without limitation the power to reject the proposed settlement. If the
Claimant settles any Third Person Claim over the objection of the Respondent
after the Respondent has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed
the defense of the Third Person Claim, the Claimant shall be deemed to have
waived any right to indemnity therefor.

     (E) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION, A CLAIM (LESS AND EXCEPT ANY CLAIM
ARISING OUT OF RETAINED LIABILITIES) AGAINST SELLER (WHETHER FOR INDEMNITY,
DEFENSE, BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT BE VALID OR
ENFORCEABLE IF SELLER DOES NOT RECEIVE A PROPER CLAIM NOTICE FOR SUCH CLAIM
WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME.

     9.5 Waiver and Limitation of Indemnities and Certain Damages.

     (a) In no event shall Respondent have any obligations to indemnify or
defend a Claimant if the Claim for which indemnity or defense is sought was
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Claimant. Nor shall
any indemnity provisions in this Agreement apply to matters affecting properties
(real, personal or mixed) and appurtenant rights (contractual or otherwise)
other than those that are covered by this Agreement.

     (b) Each party (for itself and its Related Persons), along with any Person
asserting a Claim under this Agreement, waives and agrees not to seek indirect,
consequential, punitive, incidental, special or exemplary damages of any kind
with respect to any Claim based on, related to or arising out of (in whole or in
part in any way) this Agreement, any transaction contemplated hereby or any
breach hereof or thereof (whether arising before, at or after any Closing).
However, this provision does not diminish or otherwise affect the parties'
rights and obligations to be indemnified against, and provide indemnity for,
indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive or exemplary damages
awarded to any Third Person for which indemnification is provided in this
Agreement or Seller's right to receive liquidated damages, including without
limitation the Deposit, pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2(d).

     9.6 Records. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but
in no event later than thirty (30) Days thereafter, Seller shall furnish to
Buyer all Records. Nonetheless, Seller shall have the right, at its expense
before delivery of such Records to Buyer, to make and retain copies of such
Records. Buyer shall maintain the Records received from Seller for a period of
at least seven (7) years after the Closing and at reasonable times shall afford
Seller full access to the Records as reasonably requested by Seller for review

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

and for making and retaining copies thereof at Seller's expense. If any portion
of the Records is desired to be destroyed, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to
provide Seller with written notice and the reasonable opportunity to take
possession of any or all of the same before such destruction.

     9.7 Confidentiality. The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
effective as of the Closing only as to the Assets conveyed to Buyer.

     9.8 Transfer of Operatorship. Except as prohibited by Law or applicable
Contracts, Buyer shall, upon and after Closing, assume operatorship of (a) the
Assets (or portions thereof) operated by Seller (or its designee) at 7:00 a.m.
on February 1, 2005. Seller shall use reasonable efforts (which efforts shall
not require Seller to incur any monetary or non-monetary obligations) to assist
and cooperate with Buyer in connection with its efforts to secure operatorship
of all Assets (or portions thereof). As promptly as practicable, Buyer shall
file with all pertinent Governmental Authorities all pertinent
change-of-operatorship forms and similar applications and instruments.

     (a) Strictly as an accommodation to Buyer, Seller agrees to operate the
Subject Interests (limited to those for which either Buyer or Seller is the
designated operator) for the account of the Buyer for a period not to extend
past February 1, 2005, or such earlier date as may be mutually agreed to by
Seller and Buyer. The date when Seller ceases to assist in the operation of the
Subject Interests shall be referred to hereafter as the "Termination Date".
While acting as operator on Buyer's behalf, Seller shall make good faith efforts
to operate the Subject Interests in a manner substantially similar as they were
being operated prior to Closing and in material compliance with all applicable
laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, orders, terms of permits and
authorizations by any Governmental Authority which may have jurisdiction over
the Subject Interests. Seller's duties as operator for Buyer during this period
shall include marketing (and applicable production reporting for the subject
period) of produced oil and gas consistent with past field practices. In the
case of an oil spill, blowout, explosion, fire, storm, hurricane or any other
emergency situation, Seller shall have the right to make any necessary decisions
or expenditures it deems appropriate in good faith as a prudent operator to
operate the Subject Interests, and in addition to any other expenditures
attributable to the period of time subsequent to the Effective Time, Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for any such expenditures. In addition, from the date of
Closing to the Termination Date, Seller shall endeavor to (i) assist Buyer in
the training of personnel in the operation of the Subject Interests, and (ii)
attempt to retain existing contract staff familiar with the operation of the
Subject Interests (which endeavors shall not require Seller to incur any
monetary or non-monetary obligations).

     (b) Seller further agrees to perform the accounting functions for the
Subject Interests in a manner consistent with the performance of such accounting
functions prior to the Effective Time for a period ending February 28, 2005, or
such earlier date mutually agreed to by the Parties, at which date Buyer shall
assume all accounting functions (the "Accounting Closing Date"). In order for
Seller to perform the functions set forth in this Section, Buyer shall ensure
that all revenues, proceeds and joint interests billings attributable to all
production prior to 11:59 pm on the Accounting Closing Date shall continue to be
made to Seller. From the date of Closing to the Accounting Closing Date, Seller
shall endeavor to make royalty payments that are due, pay appropriate rental
payments and handle revenue and expenditure accounting, as to the Subject



                                      -34-
<PAGE>

Interests. For purposes of this section, revenue accounting functions shall
include disbursement of revenue proceeds to all working interest, royalty and
overriding royalty owners as well as all rental and right of way payments.
Seller will complete revenue accounting for hydrocarbons produced during the
period between the Closing and the Accounting Closing Date, it being further
understood that this will entail the Seller performing revenue settlement
functions for such period after the Accounting Closing Date, but no longer than
ninety (90) days after Closing, unless mutually agreed to by the parties.
Expenditure accounting functions will include the payment of all expenditures
and subsequent billing of same to all working interest owners. Seller will
complete expenditure accounting functions for the calendar months falling
between the Closing and Accounting Closing Date. With regard to Buyer's interest
in the Subject Interests, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a detailed
monthly statement of operating revenues and expenditures, including but not
limited to operating costs, capital expenditures, production and ad valorem
taxes (hereinafter referred to as "Net Cash Flow"). The form and content of such
statement will be determined by the parties and will be issued as soon as
practicable. From the Closing through Accounting Closing Date, Seller shall
remit to Buyer the Net Cash Flow from the Subject Interests on a monthly basis.
Such payments will be made by wire transfer as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) days following the month of production.

     (c) The Parties hereby further agree that Seller shall have no liability to
Buyer, or any third party or Governmental Authority and Buyer shall release,
defend, and indemnify Seller from, any Claims, actions, suits, proceedings,
loss, costs, expenses, liability, property or environmental damage, or other
damages to or incurred by Buyer, Seller, any Third Person or Governmental
Authority which are attributable to, caused by or related to the use, ownership,
operatorship or Seller's operation of the Subject Interests from the Closing to
the Termination Date or accounting or other activities conducted by Seller from
Closing to the Accounting Closing Date, and with respect to the revenue
settlement functions after the Accounting Closing Date, regardless of the sole,
joint or concurrent negligence (ordinary or gross, sole or partial), strict
liability, regulatory liability, statutory liability, breach of contract, breach
of warranty, or other fault or responsibility of Seller or any other person or
party, except to the degree caused by the willful misconduct of Seller.

     (d) Seller shall not be obligated for any expenditures after the Effective
Time, and shall be entitled to recover any charges and expenses incurred in the
course of such operations or accounting efforts. Buyer, as of the Effective
Time, assumes responsibility for all costs and expenses associated with
ownership and operation of the Subject Interests, including but not limited to
operations, maintenance, repairs, recompilations, reconditioning, modifications,
capital expenditures, abandonments and salvage. As payment, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to (on an 8/8ths basis)all COPAS overheads for all wells
to cover for Seller's general and administrative overhead hereunder for the
month of January 2005. Subsequent to the month of January 2005 Buyer shall pay
$15,000.00 per month to Seller for Seller's performance of accounting functions
as described in subsection (b). This payment shall be made to Seller for each
month in which Seller performs the functions set forth above in Section 9.8(b)
until completion of the revenue settlement functions. Except as provided in this
subsection (d), Seller shall not be entitled to any compensation for its
operation of the Subject Interests pursuant to this Section.



                                      -35-
<PAGE>

     9.9 Conveyance Costs. Buyer shall pay all transfer, sales and use Taxes, if
any, from or arising out of the sale of the Subject Interests. Buyer is
obligated to obtain and shall be solely responsible for filing and recording
documents, and obtaining all necessary consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities or other Third Persons that are customarily obtained post-closing
related to the transfer of the Subject Interests from Seller to Buyer (including
without limitation IRS Form 1099-S and State Mineral Board Form B and for the
transfer of operatorship of any Assets (or portions thereof) from Seller or its
designee to Buyer or its designee) and for all costs, fees, obligations and
liabilities associated therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall
file each Assignment for recordation in the conveyance records of each Louisiana
parish in which any Leases or Units subject to such Assignment are located and
shall make all necessary filings with any Governmental Authority. Buyer shall
file and record all such documents as promptly as practicable after the Closing
and, as promptly as practicable after such recording or filing, shall furnish
Seller with all recording data and a certified copy (or other evidence
acceptable to Seller) of all such filings.

     9.10 Revenues, Expenses and Capital Expenditures.

     (a) Except for the Imbalance, Seller shall be entitled to all revenues,
credits, refunds, deposits and accounts receivable attributable to, or arising
out of, the ownership, operation or use of, the Subject Interests before the
Effective Time, no matter when received.

     (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.1(b), Buyer shall be
responsible for, and shall pay or cause to be paid when due, all costs,
expenses, expenditures, payments and payables (including without limitation
capital expenditures, royalties, rentals, Taxes, deposits, advanced billings
paid under an operating agreement and all prepaid insurance premiums, utility
charges, processing, gathering or transportation charges) and Claims
attributable to, or based on, related to or arising out of (in whole or in part
in any way) (i) the ownership, operation or use of any Subject Interest at or
after the Effective Time and (ii) the Imbalance, no matter when such arises,
whether before, at or after the Effective Time.

     9.11 Taxes.

     (a) Subject to Sections 9.1, 9.3 and 9.11(d), Seller shall be responsible
for, and shall pay or cause to be paid when due, all Taxes related to or arising
out of the ownership, operation or use of the Subject Interests before the
Effective Time.

     (b) Subject to Section 9.11(d), Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall
pay or cause to be paid when due, all Taxes related to or arising out of the
ownership, operation or use of the Subject Interests at or after the Effective
Time (excluding Seller's income Taxes from its sale of the Subject Interests
hereunder).

     (c) Buyer shall be solely responsible for, and shall pay or cause to be
paid when due, all transfer, sales, use or similar Taxes resulting from or
associated with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and all
documentary, filing and recording fees required in connection with the filing,
recording and approval of the Assignments.



                                      -36-
<PAGE>

     (d) Ad valorem and other property Taxes due in respect of the Subject
Interests for the tax period covering the Effective Time shall be prorated
between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective Time. To the extent that Seller has
paid any such Taxes before Closing, Buyer will reimburse Seller for the portion
of such Taxes that is attributable to the period after the Effective Time. Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid prior to delinquency, and shall be responsible
for, all such Taxes not paid before Closing, and Seller will reimburse Buyer for
the portion of such Taxes that is attributable to the period before the
Effective Time.

     (e) The party responsible for a particular Tax shall be entitled to all
deductions, credits and refunds pertaining to such Tax, no matter when received.

     9.12 Further Assurances. From and after Closing, at the request of Seller,
but without further consideration, Buyer shall execute and deliver or use
reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered such other instruments
of conveyance and take such other actions as Seller reasonably may request to
more effectively put Seller in possession of any property that was not intended
by the parties to be conveyed, or should not have been conveyed, to Buyer
(including without limitation reassignment from Buyer to Seller of any Subject
Interests that were conveyed in violation of a valid Preferential Right or
consent to assignment). From and after Closing, at the request of Buyer but
without further consideration, Seller shall execute and deliver or use
reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered such other instruments
of conveyance and take such other actions as Buyer reasonably may request to
more effectively put Buyer in possession of the Subject Interests intended to be
conveyed. If any of the Subject Interests are incorrectly described, the
description shall be corrected upon proof of the proper description. From and
after the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver
to the other such further instruments and take such further actions as may be
reasonably requested by the other party in order to more effectively assure to
the other party the full beneficial use and enjoyment of the Subject Interests
and otherwise to accomplish the purposes of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

     9.13 Transfers. The parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer's obligations
under this Agreement and under each Assignment are real obligations and run with
the land and with each subsequent Transfer of the Subject Interests. Any
Transfer by Buyer (or any successor or assign thereof) of any right, title or
interest in or to any or all portions of the Subject Interests or any Assignment
shall be void and unenforceable unless such Transfer specifically references,
and is made subject to, this Agreement and such Assignment and specifically
provides that each Person acquiring under such Transfer expressly assumes (to
the extent of the interest acquired) Buyer's obligations under this Agreement
and such Assignment. The parties understand and agree that neither any such
Transfer nor any delegation of any or all portions of Buyer's obligations
hereunder shall relieve or release Buyer (or any successor or assign thereof) of
any obligations to Seller under this Agreement unless Buyer (or any successor or
assign thereof) is expressly relieved or released thereof in writing by Seller
in its sole and absolute discretion.

     9.14 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Obligations. THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY SELLER HEREUNDER AND ALL OBLIGATIONS,
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF SELLER (OTHER THAN IN SECTIONS 4.2 AND 9.11), SHALL
TERMINATE ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME AND THEREAFTER NO ACTION MAY BE

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

COMMENCED (EITHER IN COURT, IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON A BREACH OF
THOSE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OBLIGATIONS, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. All
other representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants and agreements and the
disclaimers and waivers contained in this Agreement shall, except as expressly
provided herein, survive the Closing indefinitely. The parties have made and
make no representations or warranties except those expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

     9.15 Reservation of Claims Against Third Parties. Except to the extent
otherwise reimbursed to Seller under this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to
all amounts included or described within the Excluded Assets, including without
limitation the claims or disputes described on Exhibit "I".

     9.16 Default. Seller shall notify Buyer in the event that Seller becomes
aware that Buyer or Buyer's successors or assigns have failed to satisfy one or
more post-Closing obligations assumed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Assignments, and/or any amendments thereto (any such failures
hereinafter referred to as a "Default"). Buyer shall correct or redress or
respond to or begin to correct or redress or respond to any Default within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such written notice or such lesser or greater
time as may be dictated by any emergency situation or as required by applicable
agreements or any Law.

     (a) Failure to Respond. If (i) within such time as defined hereinabove,
Buyer does not correct or redress or respond to or begin to correct or redress
or respond to any Default, or (ii) after beginning such efforts Buyer does not
correct or redress such Default within a reasonable amount of time and within
the time required by any applicable agreements or any Law, or (iii) Seller is
unable to locate Buyer in order to notify Buyer after reasonable efforts to do
so, Seller, at its option, may endeavor to and shall be authorized to plug and
abandon well(s), remove facility(ies) or equipment or restore the surface
area(s), or otherwise correct such Default, or cause such to be done. Seller
shall exercise reasonable discretion and endeavor to accomplish only that
necessary to remedy such Default, all at the entire cost, risk and expense of
Buyer. Compliance with the notice requirements under this Agreement shall be
considered as sufficient notice to Buyer under this Section 9.16(a).

     (b) Seller Not Obligated to Remedy Buyer's Defaults. Seller shall in no
event be obligated to satisfy any Default by Buyer or its successors or assigns.

     (c) Invoicing and Recoupment by Seller. Within a reasonable period of time
after any such efforts by Seller to correct or redress such Defaults, Seller
shall furnish Buyer at its last known address with detailed invoices and
supporting documentation for expenses incurred by Seller in the efforts to
correct such Defaults, including without limitation appropriate charges for
overhead, salaries, legal costs, permits, penalties, interest, and other losses
and expenses incurred for or by Seller for the purpose of correcting or
redressing such Defaults. In the event that Buyer does not pay Seller within 15
days after the mailing of said invoices and supporting documentation, Seller
shall be entitled to [recover the relevant amount from Buyer together with
interest thereon from the date due to, but not including, the date paid at five
percent (5%) per annum on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five (365)
or three hundred sixty six (366) days, as the case may be.]



                                      -38-
<PAGE>

     (d) Other Remedies Reserved. Seller's right to proceed in the manner above
described to correct or redress Defaults of Buyer or its successors or assigns
is not intended to be, nor shall it limit or be, exclusive of any other right or
remedy, whether personal or in "rem", available to Seller under this Agreement,
the Assignments, and/or any amendments thereto, or otherwise by Law, all of
which remedies are expressly and fully ratified, granted to and reserved to
Seller.

     9.17 Conflict of Interest. Conflicts of interest related to this Agreement
are strictly prohibited. Each party, for itself and for its respective
directors, partners, employees, and agents warrants, covenants and represents to
the other that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its directors, employees, partners or agents has given to
or received from the other party, or such party's directors, partners, employees
or agents, any commission, fee, rebate, gift or other thing or service in
connection with this Agreement. Likewise, neither Buyer nor any director,
employee or agent of Buyer shall enter into any material business relationship
with any director, employee or agent of Seller (or of any affiliate of Seller),
unless such Person is acting for and on behalf of Seller, without prior written
notification thereof to Seller. Buyer and Seller each agree that their
respective books and records shall be subject to reasonable audit by the other
as may be required to verify compliance with this provision.

     9.18 Nominations and Accounting Responsibilities. From the first day of the
first production month following Closing, Seller is relieved of all
responsibility for, and Buyer will (a) bear, and commence payment of, all
burdens, fees and Taxes on or relating to the Assets (other than as described
herein), and (b) perform all nomination, marketing, accounting, royalty payment,
reporting, and other administrative responsibilities relating to the Assets.

     9.19 Reasonable Access. Seller shall assist Buyer in Buyer's preparation of
a statement of revenues and direct operating expense (including exploration and
dry hole costs) for the assets to be sold for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2003 for the sole purpose of determining the significance of the acquisition to
Buyer under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. Seller shall also
afford Buyer and its counsel, internal and independent accountants and any other
authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
necessary internal documents (including, without limitation, to their financial
accounting, books, records and accountant work papers relating to their assets
to be sold, including, without limitation, all accountants work papers) and key
employees such that Buyer and its accountants can perform the required audit of
the revenues and direct operating expenses of the assets to be sold pursuant to
SEC Regulation S-X 210.3-05. Such audit must be completed within 60 days of
Closing. If the parties can mutually agree upon the contents of same, then
Seller shall provide a signed representative letter to the independent auditor.
In no event, however, shall Seller be required to submit any statement or letter
hereunder as to the value, amount or existence of any hydrocarbon reserves.
Further, in no event shall this Section 9.19 alter the disclaimers and waivers
in Sections 4.3-4.5; in the event of any conflict between this Section 9.19 on
the one hand and Sections 4.3-4.5 on the other hand, the provisions in Sections
4.3-4.5 shall control.

this Agreement or any Assignment is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other provisions of this
Agreement and any Assignment shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
and this Agreement and any Assignment shall be construed as if the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included. Upon a determination
that any provision is illegal, invalid or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or any applicable
Assignment so as to effect the parties' intent as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner so that the transaction contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest possible extent.

<PAGE>
thirty (30) days after delivery of the initial notice, the executives of both
parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter
continue to meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to
resolve the dispute. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential

provided herein within sixty (60) days after delivery of the initial notice of
negotiation described in Section 10.19(b), or if the parties failed to meet

initiate arbitration as the exclusive means to finally resolve such dispute.
Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the CPR Rules for
Non-Administered Arbitration ("CPR Rules") then currently in effect and shall be
presided over by a tribunal consisting of three arbitrators. Pursuant to the CPR
Rules, each party shall have the right to appoint an arbitrator, and the two

(one of whom must be an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of

matters pertaining to the subject matter of the dispute. The venue of the
arbitration hearing shall be Houston, Texas. In resolving the dispute, the
arbitrators are not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory

consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary or similar damages. The
arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ss.ss.

Agreement, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
