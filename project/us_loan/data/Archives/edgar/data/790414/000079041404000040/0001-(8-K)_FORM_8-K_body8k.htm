<B><P>Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</P>

</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On December 15, 2004 Gottschalks Inc. (the "Company") entered into the First Amendment to the
Stockholder's Agreement (the "Amendment").  The original Stockholder's Agreement, by and among the Company, El Corte
Ingles ("ECI"), Joseph Levy and Bret Levy (the "Stockholder's Agreement"), was entered into on August 20, 1998, in
connection with the acquisition by the Company of substantially all of the assets of The Harris Company ("Harris"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of ECI.  As a result of the acquisition, Harris became a significant stockholder of the Company,
and both Harris and ECI became affiliates of the Company.  Joseph Levy is Chairman of the Company and Bret Levy is his son.

The Stockholder's Agreement contained transfer restrictions upon stock of the Company owned by ECI and Harris which expired
according to their terms in August 2003.  The Amendment deleted reference to those transfer restrictions.  The Amendment also
changed the term of the Stockholder's Agreement, which originally terminated upon termination of the standstill agreement
described below, to run until such time as ECI is no longer entitled pursuant to the Stockholder's Agreement to a representative
to the Board of Directors of the Company.</P>

<B><P>Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.</P>

</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Concurrently with the Amendment of the Stockholder's Agreement the Company and ECI terminated the
Standstill Agreement dated August 20, 1998 by and between the Company and ECI (the "Standstill Agreement"), which was
entered into in connection with the amendment to the Stockholder's Agreement described above.  Pursuant to the Standstill
Agreement ECI had agreed not to increase its ownership in the Company or to initiate or encourage certain transactions
relating to a change in control of the Company.  The Agreement automatically renewed every August 20, commencing August 20, 2003.
ECI had the right to terminate the Standstill Agreement upon 120 day's notice prior to the renewal date, which it had not
exercised prior to the date the Standstill Agreement was terminated.   There were no material early termination penalties on
the Company.</P>
