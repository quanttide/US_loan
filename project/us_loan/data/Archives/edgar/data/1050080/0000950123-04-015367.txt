YEAR AND ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.

On December 29, 2004, Vornado Operating Company (the "Company") announced that
it filed a Certificate of Dissolution to dissolve, and closed its stock transfer
books. Previously, the Company had announced that it expected to pay a
liquidating cash distribution of approximately $2.85 per share upon approval of
the settlement of a litigation in Delaware. That distribution was expected to
consist of approximately $2.00 per share from the assets of the Company and
approximately $0.85 per share as a result of the settlement. The settlement
hearing took place on December 28th at which the judge determined to postpone
his decision until mid-January of 2005. Accordingly, the Company's exchange
agent will pay a liquidating cash distribution of $2.00 per share to
stockholders upon surrender of their stock certificates and delivery to the
exchange agent of any other required documentation. The exchange agent is
mailing instructions for surrendering certificates to stockholders and
recommends they take no action until they have received and read those
instructions. If the settlement is approved in mid-January, the Company expects
to distribute the settlement proceeds less the then applicable litigation
expenses promptly thereafter.

A copy of the Certificate of Dissolution and the press release issued by the
Company on December 29, 2004 regarding the filing of the Certificate of
Dissolution are being filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K and
