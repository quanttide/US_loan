FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - December 29, 2004

                         VORNADO OPERATING COMPANY FILES
                           CERTIFICATE OF DISSOLUTION

PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY...VORNADO OPERATING COMPANY (OTC BB: VOOC) announced that it
has filed a Certificate of Dissolution to dissolve, and has closed its stock
transfer books. Previously, VOOC had announced that it expected to pay a
liquidating cash distribution of approximately $2.85 per share upon approval of
the settlement of a litigation in Delaware. That distribution was expected to
consist of approximately $2.00 per share from the assets of VOOC and
approximately $0.85 per share as a result of the settlement. The settlement
hearing took place yesterday at which the judge determined to postpone his
decision until mid-January of 2005. Accordingly, VOOC's exchange agent will pay
a liquidating cash distribution of $2.00 per share to stockholders upon
surrender of their stock certificates and delivery to the exchange agent of any
other required documentation. The exchange agent is mailing instructions for
surrendering certificates to stockholders and recommends they take no action
until they have received and read those instructions. If the settlement is
approved in mid-January, VOOC expects to distribute the settlement proceeds less
the then applicable litigation expenses promptly thereafter.
