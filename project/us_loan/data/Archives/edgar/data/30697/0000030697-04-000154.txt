ordinance or right  affecting the Property and the Demised  Premises,  provided,
however,  that same do not prohibit the use of the Demised  Premises for general
and executive office use in accordance with the provisions of this Lease.

     B. The Demised  Premises  are demised  and leased unto  Lessee,  for a term
("Term")  commencing  on the  Commencement  Date (as  hereinafter  defined)  and

effectiveness of any of the provisions of this Lease.

                            ARTICLE 2 - RENT

     SECTION 2.01. Lessee shall pay to Lessor, or to such other person as Lessor

     A. During and in respect of the period from the Rent  Commencement  Date to
the day preceding the Second (2nd ) Anniversary  of the Rent  Commencement  Date
(both dates inclusive) an amount each year equal to One Million, Six Hundred and
Fifty-Five  Thousand,  Eight Hundred and Ninety-Two  and 48/100  ($1,655,892.48)

     C. During and in respect of the period from the Fourth (4th) Anniversary of
the Rent  Commencement  Date to the day preceding the Sixth (6th) Anniversary of

One Million, Eight Hundred and Fourteen Thousand,  Seven Hundred and Seventy-Two
and 48/100  ($1,814,772.48)  Dollars  (exclusive  of electric)  payable in equal

payable as aforesaid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall pay the first
(1st) monthly installment of Fixed Rent upon execution of this Lease which shall
be applied against the first month's Fixed Rent after the free rent period.

     B. In the event that Lessor is unable or fails to provide Critical Services
(as  hereinafter  defined)  which it is  obligated  to provide  under this Lease

days, or if such  condition is caused by any other reason other than as provided
for herein and such condition  continues for thirty (30)  consecutive  days, and
the Demised  Premises  are in fact not used for the purposes for which they were
leased,  during such period,  then in such event,  Lessee shall be entitled to a
pro rata abatement of Rent (as  hereinafter  defined)  commencing with the sixth
(6th) consecutive  business day, or the thirty-first (31st) consecutive day that
same are unusable,  as the case may be; provided however,  that Lessee shall not
be entitled to any  abatement of Rent if such  unusability  is (a) caused by any
act or omission of Lessee or any of Lessee's  servants,  employees,  agents,  or
licensees;  or (b) where such condition arises in connection with work performed
by Lessor at the request of Lessee to make a decoration, alteration, improvement
or  addition;  or (c) where the repair in  question  are those  which  Lessee is
obligated  to make or furnish  under any of the  provisions  of this Lease.  The
provisions  of this  paragraph  B shall not  apply in the  event of a  condition
caused by fire or other casualty or  condemnation as provided for in Articles 12
and 18, respectively.

     C. As used herein the term  "Critical  Services"  shall mean  electricity,
heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and elevators to the Demised Premises.

     SECTION  2.03. If Lessee shall fail to pay as and when due under this Lease
any  Additional  Rent (as  hereinafter  defined),  and such failure shall not be

     C.1. If Lessor  shall  purchase  any item of capital  equipment or make any
capital  expenditure  intended to result in savings or  reductions in the Common
Area  Maintenance  Charges and which Lessor  reasonably  believes  shall provide
Lessee  with  the  benefit  of a  savings  or  reduction  in  such  common  area
maintenance  charges  based upon the advice of  Lessor's  consultants,  then the
costs for same shall be included in the Common Area Maintenance  Charges, to the
extent hereinafter set forth. Lessor shall deliver to Lessee, promptly following
Lessee's request, a copy of any concluded studies conducted by Lessor which show
anticipated  savings or reductions in such Common Area Maintenance  Charges as a
result of any planned capital expenditure or purchase of capital equipment.  The
costs of capital equipment or capital  expenditures are so to be included in the
Common  Area  Maintenance  Charges  in which the costs are  incurred  and in any
subsequent  years, on a  straight-line  basis, to the extent that such items are
amortized over such period of time as reasonably can be estimated at the time in
which such savings or  reductions  in such Common Area  Maintenance  Charges are
expected  to  equal  Lessor's  costs  for  such  capital  equipment  or  capital
expenditure,  with an  interest  factor  equal to two  percent  (2%)  above  the
interest rate payable on United  States  Treasury  securities  having a maturity
comparable to the period of amortization at the time Lessor incurred said costs.
If Lessor shall lease any such item of capital  equipment  designed to result in
savings or reductions in any common area maintenance  charges,  then the rentals
and other costs paid  pursuant to such leasing  shall be included in such common
area maintenance charges for the year in which they were incurred.

     2. If Lessor shall purchase any item of capital equipment or make any other
capital  expenditure  in order to  comply  with  Legal  Requirements,  Insurance
Requirements or Environmental  Laws (as those terms are hereinafter  defined) or
in order to benefit or  increase  the safety and  security  of the  Building  or
Property tenants and/or  invitees,  then the costs for same shall be included in
common area maintenance charges for the year in which the costs are incurred and
subsequent  years, on a straight-line  basis,  amortized over the useful life of
such items, with an interest factor equal to two percent (2%) above the interest
rate payable on United States Treasury  securities having a maturity  comparable
to the useful life of such items at the time  Lessor  incurred  said  costs.  If
Lessor  shall  lease any such item of  capital  equipment  to comply  with Legal
Requirements,  Insurance Requirements,  Environmental Laws or to increase safety
and  security  then the rentals and other  costs paid  pursuant to such  leasing
shall be included in common area maintenance  charges for the year in which they
were  incurred.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in no event  shall the amount
included  in  Common  Area  Maintenance  Charges  for any year  pursuant  to the
provisions of Section 3.01.C hereof exceed the projected savings for such year.

     D. If during all or part of any year,  including  calendar  year 2006,  (i)
less than  ninety-five  percent  (95%) of the leasable  space in the Building is
occupied by tenants or  occupants or (ii) Lessor  shall  furnish any  particular
item(s) of work or service  (which would  constitute  a common area  maintenance
charge  hereunder)  to less  than  ninety-five  percent  (95%)  of the  leasable
portions of the Building or to only a portion of the  Property,  due to the fact
that  less  than  ninety-five  percent  (95%) of the  leasable  portions  of the
Building are  occupied,  or because such item of work or service is not required
or desired by the tenant of such portion, or such tenant is itself obtaining and
providing  such item of work or service,  or for other  reasons,  then,  for the
purposes of  computing  the  Additional  Rent payable  hereunder,  the amount of
Common Area  Maintenance  Charges or the amount of the expenses  attributable to
such item,  as the case may be, for such period  shall be deemed to be increased
by an amount equal to the additional  costs and expenses which would  reasonably
have been incurred during such period had the Building been at least ninety-five
percent (95%) occupied or had Lessor  furnished such item of work or services to
such other portions of the Building or the Property.

     E. Lessor  shall have the absolute  right,  at all times during the Term to
increase,  reduce, alter or otherwise modify the way in which it uses, operates,
repairs,  or maintains  the Building  and/or the Property and the cost  thereof.
Nothing contained herein shall require Lessor to incur or provide any particular
service or charge in connection with its use,  operation,  repair or maintenance
of the Building and/or Property,  except as otherwise provided in this Lease, it
being agreed and understood that the items  described in Section 3.01.B.  are by
way of  illustration  only and shall not obligate  Lessor  thereto,  except that
Lessor  shall  maintain  the  Building  and  Property  in such  condition  as is
otherwise provided for herein.

     F. The  term  "Taxes"  shall  mean all  such  taxes,  assessments,  use and
occupancy taxes in respect of this Lease and any subleases made hereunder, water
and sewer charges, rates and rents, water and other meter charges (to the extent
not otherwise  included in Common Area  Maintenance  Charges or reimburseable by
tenants) and all such other  similar  charges,  taxes,  levies and sums of every
kind  or  nature  whatsoever,  general  and  special,  extraordinary  as well as
ordinary,  whether or not now within the contemplation of the parties,  as shall
or may during or in  respect  of the Term (or any  period  prior to the Term for
which Fixed Rent is payable) be assessed, levied, charged or imposed upon by any
Governmental Authority (as hereinafter defined) or become a lien, imposed by any
Governmental Authority,  on the Property,  Building, or Demised Premises, or any
part thereof,  or anything  appurtenant  thereto,  or the sidewalks,  streets or
roadways in front of,  adjacent to or appurtenant  to the Property,  Building or
Demised  Premises  (and which have a basis  related in any way to the  Property,
Building,  or  Demised  Premises  and/or the use or manner of use  thereof),  or
which,  if imposed on Lessee or in respect of the Property,  Building or Demised
Premises and if not paid by Lessee,  would be collectible from Lessor,  or which
have been so assessed, levied, charged or imposed prior to the Term (but, in the
last-mentioned  case,  only with respect to a period  falling  within the Term);
provided,  however,  that, except if and to the extent otherwise provided in the
succeeding  sentence,  "Taxes"  shall not mean  federal,  state or local  income
taxes, franchise,  excise, gift, transfer,  capital stock, estate, succession or
inheritance  taxes or  penalties  or  interest  for late  payment  of any tax in
respect of which  Lessee  shall have duly made  payment  of  Additional  Rent as
herein  provided,  or any increase in Taxes  directly  attributable  to Lessor's
Initial  Building  Renovation.  If, at any time during the Term,  the methods of
taxation prevailing at the commencement of the Term shall be altered so that, in
lieu of or as a  substitution  in whole or in part for the  taxes,  assessments,
levies,  impositions or charges now or hereafter levied,  assessed or imposed on
real estate and the improvements thereon,  shall be levied,  assessed or imposed
any tax or other  charge  on or in  respect  of the  Property,  Building  and/or
Demised  Premises or the rents,  income or gross  receipts  of Lessor  therefrom
(including any county, town, municipal, state or federal levy), then such tax or
charge  shall be  deemed a Tax,  but only to the  extent  that such Tax would be
payable if the Property,  Building or Demised  Premises,  or the rent, income or
gross receipts received  therefrom,  were the only property of Lessor subject to
such Tax,  and Lessee  shall pay and  discharge  the same as herein  provided in
respect of the payment of Taxes.

     G. The term  "School/Village  Tax Base"  shall  mean the amount of Taxes as
hereinabove defined, imposed, levied, assessed and/or collected on the Property,
for the 2006/2007 School Tax and "Town/County Tax Base" shall mean the amount of
Taxes as hereinabove defined,  imposed, levied, assessed and/or collected on the
Property for the 2006 Town and County Tax.

     H. The term "School/Village Tax Year" shall mean each period of twelve (12)
consecutive  months  commencing  as of the first day of July of each such period
for the School Tax and each twelve (12) consecutive  months commencing as of the
first of June of each such  period for the Village  Tax;  and  "Town/County  Tax
Year" shall mean each period of twelve (12) consecutive  months commencing as of
the first day of January of each such  period,  in which any part of the term of
this Lease shall  occur,  or such other  periods of twelve (12) months as may be
adopted as the fiscal year for real estate tax purposes.

     SECTION 3.02.A.  Lessee shall pay to Lessor,  as Additional Rent, during or
in  respect  of the  period  from  the  First  (1st)  Anniversary  of  the  Rent
Commencement  Date to the  Expiration  Date  (both  dates  inclusive)  for  each
School/Village   Tax  Year  and  Town/County  Year  or  portion   thereof,   its
proportionate share ("Lessee'  Proportionate  Share," as hereinafter defined) of
increases in Taxes which will be imposed,  levied,  assessed or collected on the
Property,  and/or  Building of which the Demised  Premises are a part,  for such
School/Village  Tax Year and/or  Town/County  Tax Year, as the case may be, over
the  respective  tax bases based  solely upon an increase in the tax rate or any
other tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that as
of the Commencement  Date, the Property is assessed on less than full occupancy.
Commencing in the Assessment  Year (as hereinafter  defined),  Lessee shall also
pay its  Proportionate  Share of  increases in the Taxes which are the result of
increases in the assessed  value of the Property  over the  Assessment  Base (as
hereinafter  defined).  Reasonable  fees  and  expenses,  if  any,  incurred  in
obtaining any reduction in assessed  valuation from the tentative  assessment to
the final  assessment  shall also be  considered  an  increase  in Taxes for the
purpose of this  provision.  Such payments shall be made by Lessee as Additional
Rent in equal monthly  installments during the applicable tax year together with
the payment of Fixed Rent. Copies of tax bills applicable to the  School/Village
Tax Base  and the  Town/County  Tax  Base,  as the case may be,  and to any such
applicable  tax year shall be made  available by Lessor for inspection by Lessee
during normal  business  hours. In the event of any reduction in Taxes by reason
of a reduction in the assessed value of the Property  after the Assessment  Year
and with  respect  to which  Lessee  has  paid  its  proportionate  share of any
increases in Taxes by reason of such increase in assessed  value of the Property
after the Assessment Year, any such reduction,  less fees and expenses  incurred
to obtain such reduction shall be refunded in proportionate amounts to Lessee.

     B. As used  herein the  "Assessment  Year" shall mean the tax year in which
tenants for at least Ninety-Five (95%) percent of the rentable square footage of
the Building have executed  leases and the Building has been fully assessed as a
fully  completed  and occupied  Building  with tenants  having paid a full years
rent. As used herein the "Assessment  Base" shall mean the assessed value of the
Property for tax year  immediately  following the Assessment  Year regardless of
whether or not the  Governmental  Authority (as  hereinafter  defined)  actually
increases the assessed value of the Property for that tax year.

     SECTION 3.03.A.  Lessee shall pay to Lessor,  as Additional Rent, during or
in  respect  of the  period  from  the  First  (1st)  Anniversary  of  the  Rent
Commencement  Date to the  Expiration  Date  (both  dates  inclusive)  for  each
calendar year or portion thereof,  Lessee's Proportionate Share of the increases
in the  Common  Area  Maintenance  Charges  over the over the Base  Common  Area
Maintenance  Charges (as  hereinafter  defined).  Such payments shall be made by
Lessee as Additional  Rent in equal monthly  installments  during the applicable
calendar year together with the payment of Fixed Rent.

     B. The term "Base Common Area  Maintenance  Charges" shall mean the greater
of: (x) the actual  Common Area  Maintenance  Charges in effect for the calendar
year ending  December  31, 2006 or (y) the Common  Area  Maintenance  Charges in
effect  for  the  calender  year  ending  December  31,  2006 as  grossed  up in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01.D of this Lease.

     SECTION  3.04.A.  At any time  hereafter and from time to time,  Lessor may
furnish to Lessee a  Lessor's  Statement,  which  shall be  reasonably  detailed
setting  forth  specific  items of Common Area  Maintenance  Charges and setting
forth (i) Lessor's  actual Common Area  Maintenance  Charges (or any one or more
items thereof) and/or actual Taxes for a period which shall have expired only if
a final  statement  has not  been  previously  rendered,  and/or  (ii)  Lessor's
reasonable  estimate  of Common  Area  Maintenance  Charges  and/or  Taxes for a
succeeding period. Within Thirty (30) days next following rendition of each such
Lessor's Statement,  Lessee shall pay to Lessor the entire amount, if any, shown
on such  Lessor's  Statement as being due with respect to any period which shall
have expired. In addition,  Lessee shall pay to Lessor, on the first day of each
month  following  rendition of each such Lessor's  Statement,  on account of the
estimated  Additional Rent thereafter  payable, a proportionate sum of the total
Additional Rent shown upon such Lessor's Statement as being Lessor's  reasonable
estimate  for a  succeeding  period on an annual  basis  (it being  agreed  that
Lessor's  estimate  shall in any  event be deemed  reasonable  if it is based on
actual Common Area Maintenance Charges (or any one or more items thereof) and/or
actual Taxes for a period which shall have expired immediately prior thereto, so
that one month prior to the end of such period,  Lessee's Proportionate Share of
the increase  shall be paid in full, and Lessee shall continue to pay Additional
Rent on such  basis  until  receipt of a  subsequent  Lessor's  Statement.  Such
Additional  Rent  shall  be due and  payable  at the same  time as each  monthly
installment of Fixed Rent.

     B. A reconciliation  shall be made upon each Lessor's Statement as follows:
Lessee shall be debited with any Common Area  Maintenance  Charges  and/or Taxes
payable as shown on such Lessor's Statement,  and credited with the aggregate of
the total amount,  if any, paid by Lessee in accordance  with the  provisions of
the preceding  paragraph on account of the estimated  Additional  Rent,  for the
period  or item in  question,  and,  within  thirty  (30)  days  next  following
rendition of such Lessor's Statement,  Lessee shall pay Lessor the amount of any
net debit  balance  shown thereon or Lessor shall apply against the next ensuing
installments of Fixed Rent the net credit balance shown thereon.

     C.  Without  limiting  the  preceding  provisions  of Section  3.04,  it is
understood  that Lessor shall  furnish a Lessor's  Statement,  for each calendar
year falling wholly or partially within the Term.

     SECTION  3.05.  A.  Lessor's  failure to render  Lessor's  Statements  with
respect to any period shall not  prejudice  Lessor's  right to render a Lessor's
Statement with respect to that or any subsequent period, provided, however, that
failure to provide such Lessor's  Statement  within two (2) years after any such
period shall be deemed a waiver thereof, except for any item for which Lessor is
billed  after such two (2) year  period.  The  obligations  of Lessor and Lessee
under the  provisions  of this  Article with  respect to  Additional  Rent shall
survive the expiration or any sooner  termination of the Term.  Lessor agrees to
use  reasonable  efforts to furnish  Lessor's  Statement  within One Hundred and
Twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar year.

     B. Each  Lessor's  Statement  shall be  conclusive  and binding upon Lessee
unless  within two (2) years after receipt of such  Lessor's  Statement,  Lessee
shall  notify  Lessor that it disputes  the  reasonableness  or  correctness  of
Lessor's  Statement,  specifying  to the extent  known by Lessee the respects in
which Lessor's  Statement is claimed to be unreasonable or incorrect,  which may
be a statement  that  Lessee  simply  desires to verify such costs.  Pending the
determination  of such  dispute by  agreement  or  otherwise,  Lessee  shall pay
Additional Rent in accordance with the applicable Lessor's  Statement,  and such
payment will be without prejudice to Lessee's position.  If the dispute shall be
finally  determined  in  Lessee's  favor by a court of  competent  jurisdiction,
Lessor  shall  forthwith  pay  Lessee  the  amount of  Lessee's  overpayment  of
Additional Rent resulting from compliance with Lessor's  Statement together with
interest  thereon at the legal rate,  or Lessee  may,  on ten (10) days  written
notice to Lessor, offset such overpayment from the Rent next accruing hereunder.

     C. Provided that Lessee substantially  complies with the provisions of this
Section  3.05,  Lessee shall have the right,  at its sole cost and  expense,  to
retain  an  independent  firm  of  certified  public  accountants,  or  Lessee's
employees or other firms retained by Lessee ("Lessee's Accountants"),  to review
supporting data and/or  documentation for any portion of Lessor's Statement that
Lessee disputes. Lessee's right under the provisions of this Section 3.05 may be
exercised  only  once  for  any  Lessor's  Statement  and  if  Lessee  fails  to
substantially satisfy all of the conditions contained in this Section 3.05, then
in  such  event,  Lessee's  rights  as  provided  herein  with  respect  to that
particular Lessor's Statement shall be deemed waived.

     D.1. Lessee acknowledges that Lessor maintains its records for the Property
at the offices of its  managing  agent as it may change  from time to time,  and
Lessee  agrees that any review of records as provided  for in this  Section 3.05
shall take place at the offices of  Lessor's  managing  agent,  which may change
from time to time.  Lessee  acknowledges and agrees that any records reviewed by
it shall  constitute  confidential  information  of  Lessor  which  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Lessee's  Accountants  and the  principals of
Lessee who receive the results of the review and disclosure or  dissemination of
such  information  shall be deemed a  material  breach of this  Lease and Lessor
shall be entitled to all its remedies at law or in equity.

     2. In the  event  that  Lessee's  Accountants  find an  error  in  Lessor's
Statement,  such error shall be: (i) promptly corrected in the event that Lessor
agrees with Lessee's  Accountant,  or (ii) resolved by agreement  between Lessor
and Lessee in the event that Lessor does not agree with Lessee's Accountants. In
the event that Lessor and Lessee are unable to resolve such error,  then in such
event the error shall be determined by  arbitration  pursuant to the  provisions
hereof.  If the Disputed Item (as hereinafter  defined) is agreed upon by Lessor
and Lessee, or found by the arbitrators, to be greater or lesser than the amount
set forth in Lessor's Statement,  then in such event: (i) if Lessee has overpaid
its obligations for a preceding period,  the amount of such overpayment shall be
credited  against  Lessee's  subsequent  installments  obligations  to  pay  its
Proportionate  Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs or Rent; or (ii) if Lessee
has  underpaid  its  obligations  for a  preceding  period,  the  amount of such
underpayment  shall be paid to Lessor with Lessee's next installment  obligation
of Common Area Maintenance Costs. If the dispute shall be determined in Lessee's
favor by  arbitration  or otherwise and Lessee's  Proportionate  Share of Common
Area Maintenance Charges increases as charged by Lessor is more than one hundred
and ten (110%) percent of Lessee's Proportionate Share as determined by Lessee's
audit after arbitration,  as the case may be, then in such event,  Lessor agrees
to reimburse Lessee for all reasonable  actual out of pocket audit fees incurred
by Lessee in connection therewith,  provided, however, that same does not exceed
the amount that it has been  determined  that  Lessor  owes Lessee and  provided
further,  that Lessor shall have no obligation to reimburse  Lessee for the cost
of its in-house certified public accountants.

     3.A.  In the event  that  Lessor and Lessee are unable to resolve a dispute
concerning  the  reasonableness  and/or  correctness  of any  specific  item  on
Lessor's Statement (hereinafter referred to as the "Disputed Item"), then either
Lessor or Lessee  (hereinafter  referred to as the "Initiating  Party") may give
the other party (hereinafter called the "Responding Party") a notice designating
the name and address of the arbitrator designated by the Initiating Party to act
on its behalf in the  arbitration  process  hereinafter  described  (the "Review
Notice").

     B. If the Initiating  Party gives a Review Notice,  then within twenty (20)
days after giving of such Review Notice,  the Responding Party shall give notice
to  Initiating  Party  specifying  in such  notice  the name and  address of the
arbitrator designated by the Responding Party to act on its behalf. In the event
the Responding  Party shall fail to give such notice within such twenty (20) day
period, then the appointment of such arbitrator shall be made in the same manner
as  hereinafter  provided for the  appointment  of a third  arbitrator in a case
where two  arbitrators  are  appointed  hereunder  and the parties are unable to
agree to such  appointment.  The two  arbitrators  so chosen  shall meet  within
thirty (30) days after the second  arbitrator  is appointed  and shall  exchange
sealed envelopes each containing such arbitrator's  written  determination as to
the  reasonableness  and/or correctness of the Disputed Item. The reasonableness
and/or  correctness of any Disputed Item submitted by Lessor's  arbitrator shall
be called the "Lessor's  Submitted Value" and reasonableness  and/or correctness
of any  Disputed  Item  submitted  by  Lessee's  arbitrator  shall be called the
"Lessee's Submitted Value". Copies of such written determinations shall promptly
be sent to both Lessor and Lessee. Any failure of either such arbitrator to meet
and  exchange  such  determinations  shall be  acceptance  of the other  party's
arbitrator's  determination as to the  reasonableness  and/or correctness of the
Disputed  Item if, and only if, such  failure  persists  for five (5) days after
notice to the party for whom such arbitrator is acting,  and, provided that such
five (5) day period shall be extended by reason of any Unavoidable Delay. If the
higher determination as to the reasonableness and/or correctness of the Disputed
Item is not  more  than  one  hundred  and  five  (105%)  percent  of the  lower
determination as to the reasonableness  and/or correctness of the Disputed Item,
then the reasonableness  and/or correctness of the Disputed Item shall be deemed
to  be  the  average  of  the  two  determinations.   If,  however,  the  higher
determination  is more than one  hundred  and five  (105%)  percent of the lower
determination,  then within ten (10) days of the date the arbitrators  submitted
their  respective  determinations,  the two  arbitrators  shall  appoint a third
arbitrator.  In the event of their being  unable to agree upon such  appointment
within  ten (10) days after the  exchange  of the  sealed  envelopes,  the third
arbitrator shall be selected by the parties themselves if they can agree thereon
within a further  period of ten (10) days. If the parties do not so agree,  then
either party, on behalf of both and on notice to the other,  may request such an
appointment  by  the  American   Arbitration   Association   (or  any  successor
organization)  in accordance  with its rules then  prevailing or if the American
Arbitration  Association (or any successor  organization)  shall fail to appoint
said third arbitrator  within fifteen (15) days after such request is made, then
either  party may apply for such  appointment,  on notice to the  other,  to the
President of the Westchester  County Bar  Association  (who may consult with the
Chairman  of the Real  Property  Law  Committee  of the  Westchester  County Bar
Association).  Within  ten  (10)  days  after  the  appointment  of  such  third
arbitrator,  the Lessor's  arbitrator  shall submit Lessor's  Submitted Value to
such  third  arbitrator  and  the  Lessee's  arbitrator  shall  submit  Lessee's
Submitted Value to such third arbitrator.  Such third arbitrator  shall,  within
thirty (30) days after the end of such  fifteen  (15) day  period,  make his own
determination as to the reasonableness  and/or correctness of the Disputed Item,
and  send  copies  of his  determination  promptly  to both  Lessor  and  Lessee
specifying  whether  Lessor's  Submitted  Value or Lessee's  Submitted Value was
closer to the  determination by such third  arbitrator as to the  reasonableness
and/or  correctness of the Disputed Item.  Whichever of Lessor's Submitted Value
or Lessee's  Submitted Value shall be closer to the  determination by such third
arbitrator shall conclusively be deemed correct.

     C. In no event shall the arbitrators  enlarge upon, or alter or amend, this
Lease or  Lessor's  or  Lessee's  rights as  provided  in this  Lease,  it being
understood that the sole issue for determination by the arbitrators shall be the
single issue of fact as to the reasonableness and/or correctness of the Disputed
Item.  The   arbitrators   shall  be  certified   public   accountants  who  are
disinterested and are currently  practicing in the Westchester  County, New York
area with at least ten (10) years  experience in evaluating and auditing  common
area maintenance charges.

     D. Except as otherwise  provided in the  following  sentence,  the fees and
expenses of an arbitration proceeding shall be borne by the parties equally. The
fees of  respective  counsel  engaged by the  parties  the fees and  expenses of
expert witnesses and other witnesses called and the cost of transcripts shall be
borne by the parties  engaging  such counsel or calling such witness or ordering
such transcripts.

     SECTION  3.06.  Lessee  shall  pay and  discharge,  or cause to be paid and
discharged,  the following  items,  regardless  of to whom or how incurred,  all
taxes and  assessments,  if any,  which shall or may during the Term be charged,
levied,  assessed or imposed upon, or become a lien upon, the personal  property
of Lessee used in the operation of the Demised  Premises and which,  if not paid
by Lessee, would be collectible from Lessor.

                    ARTICLE 4 - USE OF DEMISED PREMISES

     SECTION  4.01.A.  Subject to the  provisions of this Article,  Lessee shall
have the right to use the Demised  Premises  for general  and  executive  office
purposes,  for a trading floor and executive  kitchen and dining room and for no
other purposes,  provided,  however,  that with respect to the trading floor and
executive  kitchen and dining room,  Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense,
be required to comply with all Legal  Requirements,  Insurance  Requirement  and
Environmental Laws with respect to such use (the "Permitted Use").

     B.1. From and after the  Commencement  Date,  Lessor does hereby grant unto
Lessee  the  privilege  and a license  to One  Hundred  and  Thirty-Eight  (138)
non-reserved  parking  spaces in the parking  area located on the Property for a
period  to be  coterminous  with  the  Term of this  Lease  for a  period  to be
coterminous  with the Term of this Lease.  Lessee  agrees that Lessor shall have
the right,  in its sole and absolute  discretion,  upon thirty (30) days written
notice to Lessee,  to change the location of all non-reserved  parking spaces in
the event  that  Lessor  determines  to change  the area,  level,  location  and
arrangement of parking areas and other facilities;  to build multistory  parking
facilities;  to temporarily restrict parking by lessees, their officers,  agents
and  employees;  and to close all or any portion of said areas or  facilities to
such extent as may be legally  sufficient to prevent a dedication thereof or the
accrual of any right to any person or the public therein;  to close  temporarily
all or any portion of the parking areas or  facilities to discourage  non-tenant
parking,  provided,  however,  that in the event such  closure is during  Normal
Working Hours (as hereinafter  defined) Lessor shall provide Lessee with no less
than the number of  non-reserved  parking  spaces  required to be provided under
this Lease at a location  within a reasonable  distance of the Demised  Premises
and at no charge to Lessee. The license and privilege hereby granted shall apply
only to those duly registered and operating  private  passenger motor vehicle(s)
owned and operated by Lessee or Lessee's employees, invitees and contractors and
shall  not be  transferable  to any other  person or used for any other  purpose
other than as herein  provided.  Lessee and its employees,  officers,  partners,
directors,  agents,  and  contractors,  covenant  and agree that they shall park
their vehicles in legal parking spaces  designated by Lessor on the Property and
shall not park their vehicles in any other  location on the Property,  or on any
roadway or property adjacent to the Property.

     B.1. From and after the  Commencement  Date,  Lessor does hereby grant unto
Lessee the privilege and a license to Twenty-One (21) reserved parking spaces in
the parking area located on the Property as shown on EXHIBIT "F" annexed  hereto
and made a part hereof,  which shall be identified as exclusive to Lessee, for a
period to be coterminous with the Term of this Lease.  Lessee agrees that Lessor
shall have the right,  upon thirty (30) days written notice to Lessee, to change
the location of all reserved parking spaces in the event that Lessor is required
to do so by reason  of any Legal  Requirements,  Insurance  Requirements  and/or
Environmental  Laws.  Lessee  further agrees that Lessor shall have the right to
change the  location  of all  reserved  parking  spaces in the event that Lessor
determines to change the area, level,  location and arrangement of parking areas
and other facilities or build multistory parking facilities,  provided, however,
that Lessor  shall not make such  change to  accommodate  another  tenant in the
Building  and  such  alternate  area  for  the  reserved  parking  spaces  is as
reasonably close the main elevator bank as the previous reserved parking spaces;
to  temporarily  restrict  parking  by  lessees,  their  officers,   agents  and
employees;  and to close all or any portion of said areas or  facilities to such
extent as may be  legally  sufficient  to  prevent a  dedication  thereof or the
accrual of any right to any person or the public therein;  to close,  other than
during Normal Working Hours, temporarily all or any portion of the parking areas
or facilities to discourage non-tenant parking. The license and privilege hereby
granted  shall  apply  only to  those  duly  registered  and  operating  private
passenger motor vehicle(s)  owned and operated by Lessee or Lessee's  employees,
invitees and  contractors  and shall not be  transferable to any other person or
used for any  other  purpose  other  than as  herein  provided.  Lessee  and its
employees, officers, partners, directors, agents, and contractors,  covenant and

in any  manner,  or do or suffer or permit  anything  to be done in the  Demised
Premises,  or bring  anything  into the  Demised  Premises  or  suffer or permit

insurance with extended coverage, or rental,  liability or boiler insurance,  or
other insurance provided for in Section 11.01 or otherwise may be required to be
furnished  by Lessor  under the terms of the  Mortgage  or  Superior  Lease with
respect to the Demised Premises (Lessor acknowledges that the use of the Demised

     SECTION 4.03. If any  governmental  license or permit shall be required for
the proper and lawful  conduct of Lessee's  business in the Demised  Premises or
any part thereof, then Lessee, at its sole cost and expense,  shall duly procure
and thereafter maintain such license or permit and submit the same to inspection
by Lessor.  Lessee shall, at all times,  comply with the terms and conditions of
each such  license  or permit,  but in no event  shall  failure  to procure  and
maintain same by Lessee affect Lessee's obligations hereunder.  Lessee shall not

the Demised  Premises,  in violation of any certificate of occupancy  issued for
the Building or Property.

     SECTION 4.04. Lessee shall obtain the appropriate  certificate(s)  required

blacktopping thereon.

     SECTION  4.07.  A. Lessee  shall not  release,  discharge or dispose of, or
permit, or suffer any release,  discharge or disposal of any Hazardous  Material
at the Demised  Premises in violation of any  Environmental  Law (as hereinafter

Demised Premises in violation of any Environmental Law.

     B. Lessee shall: (i) promptly,  upon learning thereof, notify Lessor of any

Environmental  Laws, and to the extent the presence thereof is caused by Lessor,
or a third party (other than Lessee,  its agents,  contractors,  subcontractors,
invitees  or  licensees),  or is a  pre-existing  condition,  Lessor  shall,  at
Lessor's sole cost and expense,  promptly  take all actions  necessary to comply

approved in writing by Lessor and shall be installed where  designated by Lessor
and maintained in good condition,  repair and appearance at all times, according
to Lessor's standards and the laws of the municipality  having jurisdiction over
such signs.  If Lessor  shall deem it  necessary  to remove any sign in order to
paint or to make any repairs, alterations or improvements in or upon the Demised

in violation  of this  paragraph  and to charge  Lessee the cost of such removal
without liability to Lessee for such removal.

     B. Subject to the  provisions of Section 10.03 of this Lease,  in the event

Building,  then in such event, Lessor agrees that Lessee herein named shall have
the right to have their name  installed on or above the entrance to the Building
or in the lobby of the Building.

     SECTION 4.09 No property, other than such as might normally be brought upon

in the Demised Premises.

             ARTICLE 5- POSSESSION AND CONDITION OF DEMISED PREMISES

     SECTION 5.01.  Lessee has  inspected the Demised  Premises and the state of
title thereto and Lessee accepts the Demised Premises in their "AS IS" state and
condition on the Commencement  Date and without any  representation  or warranty
(except as expressly set forth herein),  express or implied,  in fact or by law,
by Lessor,  and without  recourse to Lessor,  as to title  thereto,  the nature,
condition or usability  thereof or as to the use or occupancy  which may be made
thereof.

     SECTION 5.02.A. If delivery of possession to the Demised Premises to Lessee
is delayed by reason of Unavoidable Delays (as hereinafter  defined),  then this
Lease and the validity  thereof  shall not be affected  thereby and Lessee shall
not be  entitled  to  terminate  this  Lease,  to claim  actual or  constructive
eviction,  partial or total, or to be compensated for loss or injury suffered as
a result thereof, nor shall the same be construed in any way to extend the Term,
provided,  however,  that,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Article 1, the
Commencement  Date shall be deemed to occur only if and when  possession  of the
Demised Premises is made available to Lessee.

     B. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except for Lessee Delays, in the event
that the Demised  Premises are not  delivered to Lessee on or before May 1, 2005
(the "Delivery  Date") time being of the essence with respect to said date, then
in such event, and in lieu of any other remedies at law or in equity, Lessee may
serve notice on Lessor of its intention to terminate  this Lease on May 31, 2005
(the  "Termination  Date")  and if by the  Termination  Date,  Lessor  shall not
delivered  possession of the Demised  Premises to Lessee in accordance  with the
provisions of this Lease,  this Lease shall terminate on the Termination Date as
if such  termination  date were the  Expiration  Date,  and the  Fixed  Rent and
Security  Deposit  paid by Lessee  upon the  execution  of this  Lease  shall be
refunded  by  Lessor  to  Lessee.  Lessee  hereby  agrees  that in the  event it
exercises it right to terminate  this Lease,  then in such event,  Lessee hereby
agrees  that  Lessee's  right  to  terminate  this  Lease  shall be its sole and
exclusive  remedy.  Lessor and  Lessee  agree that this  Section  8.02.C.  is an
express  provision  to the  contrary  as to the time when Lessor  shall  deliver
possession of the Demised Premises.

     C. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except for Lessee Delays, in the event
that  Lessor's  Lobby   Renovation   Work  (as   hereinafter   defined)  is  not
substantially  complete June 1, 2005 (the "Lobby Renovation  Completion  Date"),
then in such  event,  and in lieu of any  other  remedies  at law or in  equity,
Lessee  shall be entitled to a credit  against  Fixed Rent in the amount of: (i)
One Thousand,  One Hundred and  Thirty-Four and 17/100  ($1,134.17)  Dollars for

damages (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Rent Credit").

     SECTION 5.03. The provisions of this Article shall be considered an express
provision to the contrary pursuant to New York Real Property Law Section 223-(a)
governing  delivery of possession of the Demised  Premises and any law providing

enacted shall have no application is such case to the extent  inconsistent  with

consumption  and Lessee  shall pay for water  consumed as shown on said meter as

perimeter  fan coils that total Ten Thousand,  Four Hundred and Twenty  (10,420)
cubic feet per minute and Twelve Thousand  (12,000) cubic feet per minute to the
Seventh  (7th)  floor  atrium and center  areas;  and (ii)  Forty-Five  Thousand
(45,000) cubic feet per minute at 62-64 degrees F for heat.

     2.  If due  to  use of the  Demised  Premises  in a  manner  exceeding  the
aforementioned  occupancy and electrical load criteria,  or due to rearrangement
of  partitioning  after  the  initial   preparation  of  the  Demised  Premises,
interference  with normal  operation of the  Building's AC System  servicing the
Demised  Premises  results,  necessitating  changes in the  Building's AC System
servicing  the  Demised  Premises,  such  changes  shall be made by Lessor  upon
written  notice to Lessee and Lessee's  sole cost and expense.  Lessee agrees to
keep all windows closed,  and to lower and close window coverings when necessary
because of the sun's position  whenever the said air  conditioning  system is in
operation,  and Lessee agrees at all times to cooperate fully with Lessor and to
abide by all the regulations and requirements which Lessor may prescribe for the
proper functioning and protection of the said air conditioning  system.  Lessor,
throughout the Term, shall have free and unrestricted  access to any and all air
conditioning facilities in the Demised Premises.

     E. It is agreed and understood that Lessee is responsible for designing and
building the heating,  air  conditioning  and  ventilating  distribution  system
within the Demised  Premises  (the "HVAC  Distribution  System") and that Lessor
makes no representation that the HVAC Distribution System will be able to comply
with the foregoing  specifications,  provided,  however,  that Lessor represents
that the  Building's  AC System  will be  capable  of  delivering  the  required
performance  specifications to Lessee's point of distribution within the Demised
Premises.  If due to use of the  Demised  Premises  in a  manner  exceeding  the
aforementioned  occupancy and electrical load criteria,  or due to rearrangement
of partitioning of the Demised  Premises by reason of Lessee's Work, or the HVAC
Distribution  System,  interference  with normal  operation of the Building's AC
System in the Demised Premises results,  necessitating changes in the Building's
AC System servicing the Demised  Premises,  such changes shall be made by Lessee
at its sole cost and expense.

     SECTION  6.02.  During the Term hereof and any Renewal  Term,  Lessor shall
furnish to Lessee  cleaning  services for the Demised  Premises,  Monday through
Friday, in accordance with the Cleaning Specifications annexed hereto as EXHIBIT
"D."

     SECTION 6.03.A. If Lessee requests air cooling,  heat or ventilation in the
Demised Premises outside Normal Working Hours (the "Overtime Services"),  Lessee
agrees to pay to Lessor the Overtime  Charge (as  hereinafter  defined) to cover
Lessor's  expenses for  providing  such Overtime  Services.  Except as otherwise
specifically  provided for in the Lease,  Lessor  agrees that  Electric  Service
shall be furnished to the Demised  Premises in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.04 of this Lease twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.

     B.1 Lessor shall furnish such Overtime Services to Lessee provided that (i)
Lessee  pays to  Lessor as  Additional  Rent the  hourly  Overtime  Charges  (as
hereinafter defined) for each hour that Lessee requests Overtime Services, which
Overtime  Charges  will be billed to Lessee  along with  Lessee's  next  monthly
installment  of Fixed Rent if such service  shall have been  furnished to Lessee
prior to the  fifteenth  (15th)  day of the month or along  with the  subsequent
monthly  installment  of Fixed Rent if such service shall have been furnished to
Lessee after the fifteenth  (15th) day of the month,  (ii) that Lessee's request
shall be  received  by Lessor by not later  than 2:00 P.M.  on the day for which
after  hours  service is  requested  (and by not later than 2:00 P.M. on the day
preceding  any  requested  before-hours  service),  and (iii) the  Building's AC
system is not then producing chilled water for future.  Notwithstanding anything
contained to the contrary in this Article 6, Lessee shall not be required to pay
Overtime  Charges for  intermittent  use of the Demised  Premises outside Normal
Working  Hours,  unless  such use  shall be on a scale  and  frequency  so as to
constitute  the regular  operation of Lessee's  business  outside Normal Working
Hours. In no event, however,  shall Lessor be obligated to supply heating or air
conditioning outside of Normal Working Hours unless Lessee shall request and pay
for the same as  provided  in this  Article 6. In the event that  Lessee and any
other tenant in the Building  shall  request  Overtime  Services,  then,  to the
extent that the Building  Equipment  permits same, Lessee and such other tenants
shall pay their proportionate share of the Overtime Charges.

     2. As used herein,  the "Overtime  Charges" shall be an amount equal to the
sum of:  (i) One  Hundred  and 00/100  ($100.00)  Dollars  and (ii) the  Utility
Consumption  Charges (as  hereinafter  defined).  As used  herein,  the "Utility
Consumption  Charges"  shall be  determined  by adding  Lessor's  actual cost of
providing all electric  service,  natural gas service and/or oil consumed in the
Building, as the case may be, during the month in which such Overtime Service is
requested and dividing  that total amount by the total number of Normal  Working
Hours during the month in which such Overtime Service is requested.

     3.  Lessee  agrees that the  Overtime  Charges,  may from time to time,  be
increased by Lessor, with not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Lessee, if the rates at which Lessor purchases electrical energy from the public
utility  corporation  supplying  electrical current to the Building of which the
Demised  Premises  are a part shall be  increased,  or any tax is  imposed  upon
Lessor's  receipt from the sale or resale of  electrical  energy by any Federal,
State or Municipal Authority, or any charges incurred or taxes payable by Lessor
in  connection  therewith  shall be  increased.  The Overtime  Charges  shall be
increased by an amount equal to the product of the respective  hourly rate times
the percentage increase in the rates at which Lessor purchases electrical energy
from the public utility corporation as aforesaid.

     SECTION 6.04.A.  During the Term hereof,  or any Renewal Term, Lessor shall
also  provided  Lessee  with the  necessary  facilities  to furnish  electricity
("Electric  Service")  to  the  Demised  Premises,  including  any  supplemental
heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems.

     B. Lessee agrees that it shall  purchase or receive such  Electric  Service
directly  from Lessor and to pay  directly  to Lessor all  charges for  Electric
Service rendered or supplied to the Demised Premises throughout the Term hereof,
or any Renewal Term.

     C. Lessee's  consumption of Electric  Service shall be measured by means of
separate  flow meters  (hereinafter  referred to as the  "Meters")  installed by
Lessee as part of Lessee's Work, and Lessee shall pay, during the entire Term of
this Lease,  or any Renewal Term, all costs and expenses  including the payments
of any taxes and/or  penalties in connection  therewith for all Electric Service
used,  consumed or provided to the Demised Premises,  including  electricity for
any auxiliary  heating,  ventilating and air conditioning  systems servicing the
Demised  Premises.  All such costs and expenses for Electric Service shall be at
the same rates that the  utility  company  servicing  the  Building  is charging
Lessor for consumption of electricity in the Building.

     D. Lessee shall pay for all Electric Service consumed,  used or provided to
the  Demised  Premises as  hereinabove  provided  within  twenty (20) days after
rendition of a bill for same by Lessor (the "Utility  Statement").  Lessor shall
bill Lessee at Lessor's cost for all Electric  Service and there shall be no fee
payable to Lessor to read the Meters and  prepare  the  Utility  Statement.  All
Electric  Service  billed by Lessor to Lessee shall be deemed  Additional  Rent.
Each Utility Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon Lessee unless within
thirty (30) days after  receipt of such Utility Bill Lessee shall notify  Lessor
that it disputes the  reasonableness  or correctness  of the Utility  Statement,
specifying  the  respects  in which  the  Utility  Statement  is  claimed  to be
unreasonable  or  incorrect.  Pending  the  determination  of  such  dispute  by
agreement or otherwise, Lessee shall pay for Electric Service in accordance with
the applicable Utility Statement,  and such payment will be without prejudice to
Lessee's position.

     E. Lessee shall make no substantial alterations or additions to the initial
lighting,  electrical appliances or office equipment if the connected electrical
load,  when  combined  with the load of all lighting  fixtures and all occupancy
factors  (excluding  any  supplemental  HVAC system  installed  by Lessee in the
Demised  Premises as part of Lessee's  Work)  exceeds  seven and one-half  (7.5)
watts of connected  per square foot of installed  ceiling  area,  without  first
obtaining written consent from Lessor in each instance. Lessor warrants that the
electrical  facilities  servicing the Demised Premises are in good working order
and  can  accommodate  a  normal  office  installation  with  associated  office
machinery and equipment,  provided,  however, that the connected electrical load
(excluding  any  supplemental  HVAC  system  installed  by Lessee in the Demised
Premises as part of Lessee's Work) , when combined with the load of all lighting
fixtures  and all  occupancy  factors  does  not  exceed  seven  (7.5)  watts of
connected load per square foot of installed  ceiling area. Lessee agrees that at
all times its use of Electric  Service shall not exceed the capacity or overload
any of the central and appurtenant installations for Electric Service including,
but not  limited to all wires,  feeders,  risers,  electrical  boxes,  switches,
outlets,  connections,  and cables located in the Property, Building, or Demised
Premises or any other mechanical equipment spaces located therein.  Lessee's use
of Electric  Service shall not interfere with the use thereof by other occupants
of the  Property,  or Building and shall be of such a nature,  as  determined by
Lessor in its  reasonable  judgment and  discretion,  so as not cause  permanent
damage or injury to the Demised  Premises  or the  Building of which the Demised
Premises are a part,  or cause or create a dangerous  or hazardous  condition or
entail excessive or unreasonable  alterations,  repairs or expense, or interfere
with or disturb other tenants or occupants.

     SECTION  6.05.A.  Provided  that  Lessee  substantially  complies  with the
provisions of this Section 6.05,  Lessee shall have the right,  at its sole cost
and expense, to retain an independent  engineering firm or electrical contractor
("Lessee's  Engineers"),  to review supporting data and/or documentation for any
portion of the  Utility  Statement  that  Lessee  disputes.  If Lessee  fails to
satisfy substantially all of the conditions contained in this Section 6.05, then
in  such  event,  Lessee's  rights  as  provided  herein  with  respect  to that
particular Utility Statement shall be deemed waived.

     B. Lessee  acknowledges  and agrees  that any records  reviewed by it shall
constitute  confidential  information  of Lessor which shall not be disclosed to
anyone  other  than the  Lessee's  Engineers  and the  principals  of Lessee who
receive  the  results of the  review and  disclosure  or  dissemination  of such
information  shall be deemed a material breach of this Lease and Lessor shall be
entitled to all its remedies at law or in equity.

     C. In the event  that  Lessee's  Engineers  find an error in the  amount of
Electric  Service  consumed by Lessee in the  Demised  Premises as stated in the
Utility  Statement  (hereinafter  referred to as "Electric  Consumption"),  such
error shall be: (i)  promptly  corrected  in the event that  Lessor  agrees with
Lessee's  Engineers,  or (ii) resolved by agreement between Lessor and Lessee in
the event that Lessor does not agree with Lessee's Engineers.  In the event that
Lessor and Lessee are unable to resolve  such  error,  then in such  event,  the
error shall be determined by  arbitration  as provided for in this Section 6.05.
If the amount of Electric  Consumption  is agreed upon by Lessor and Lessee,  or
found by the  arbitrators,  to be greater or lesser than the amount set forth in
the  Utility  Statement,  then in such  event:  (i) if Lessee has  overpaid  its
obligations  for a preceding  period,  the amount of such  overpayment  shall be
credited against Lessee's subsequent  obligation to pay its Utility Statement or
Rent; or (ii) if Lessee has underpaid its  obligations  for a preceding  period,
the  amount of such  underpayment  shall be paid to Lessor  with  Lessee's  next
Utility Statement or Rent.

     D. In the event  that  Lessor  and  Lessee  are unable to resolve a dispute
concerning  the amount of Electric  Consumption  in the Demised  Premises,  then
either Lessor or Lessee (hereinafter  referred to as the "Initiating Party") may
give the  other  party  (hereinafter  called  the  "Responding  Party") a notice
designating the name and address of the arbitrator  designated by the Initiating
Party to act on its behalf in the arbitration process hereinafter described (the
"Review Notice").

     E. If the Initiating  Party gives a Review Notice,  then within twenty (20)
days after giving of such Review Notice,  the Responding Party shall give notice
to  Initiating  Party  specifying  in such  notice  the name and  address of the
arbitrator designated by the Responding Party to act on its behalf. In the event
the Responding  Party shall fail to give such notice within such twenty (20) day
period, then the appointment of such arbitrator shall be made in the same manner
as  hereinafter  provided for the  appointment  of a third  arbitrator in a case
where two  arbitrators  are  appointed  hereunder  and the parties are unable to
agree to such  appointment.  The two  arbitrators  so chosen  shall meet  within
thirty (30) days after the second  arbitrator  is appointed  and shall  exchange
sealed envelopes each containing such arbitrator's written  determination of the
amount of Electric Consumption. The amount of the Electric Consumption specified
by Lessor's  arbitrator  shall be called the "Lessor's  Submitted Value" and the
amount of Electric Consumption  specified by Lessee's arbitrator shall be called
the "Lessee's  Submitted  Value".  Copies of such written  determinations  shall
promptly  be sent to  both  Lessor  and  Lessee.  Any  failure  of  either  such
arbitrator to meet and exchange such  determinations  shall be acceptance of the
other party's arbitrator's determination as to the Electric Consumption, if, and
only if, such  failure  persists for five (5) days after notice to the party for
whom such  arbitrator  is acting,  and,  provided  that such five (5) day period
shall  be  extended  by  reason  of  any   Unavoidable   Delay.  If  the  higher
determination  of the Electric  Consumption for the Demised Premises is not more
than one  hundred  and five  (105%)  percent of the lower  determination  of the
Electric  Consumption,  then the Electric  Consumption for the Demised  Premises
shall be deemed to be the average of the two  determinations.  If, however,  the
higher  determination  is more than one hundred  and five (105%)  percent of the
lower  determination,  then  within  ten (10)  days of the date the  arbitrators
submitted  their  respective  Electric  Consumption   determinations,   the  two
arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator. In the event of their being unable
to agree upon such  appointment  within ten (10) days after the  exchange of the
sealed  envelopes,  the  third  arbitrator  shall  be  selected  by the  parties
themselves if they can agree thereon  within a further  period of ten (10) days.
If the  parties do not so agree,  then  either  party,  on behalf of both and on
notice to the other, may request such an appointment by the American Arbitration
Association  (or any successor  organization)  in accordance with its rules then
prevailing  or  if  the  American  Arbitration  Association  (or  any  successor
organization)  shall fail to appoint said third  arbitrator  within fifteen (15)
days  after  such  request  is  made,  then  either  party  may  apply  for such
appointment,  on notice to the other, to the President of the Westchester County
Bar  Association  (who may consult  with the  Chairman of the Real  Property Law
Committee of the Westchester County Bar Association). Within ten (10) days after
the appointment of such third arbitrator,  the Lessor's  arbitrator shall submit
Lessor's  Submitted Value to such third  arbitrator and the Lessee's  arbitrator
shall  submit  Lessee's  Submitted  Value to such third  arbitrator.  Such third
arbitrator shall, within thirty (30) days after the end of such fifteen (15) day
period,  make his own  determination of the Electric  Consumption in the Demised
Premises,  and send  copies of his  determination  promptly  to both  Lessor and
Lessee specifying  whether Lessor's  Submitted Value or Lessee's Submitted Value
was  closer  to the  determination  by such  third  arbitrator  of the  Electric
Consumption in the Demised  Premises.  Whichever of Lessor's  Submitted Value or
Lessee's  Submitted  Value  shall be closer to the  determination  by such third
arbitrator  shall  conclusively be deemed to be the Electric  Consumption in the
Demised Premises.

     F. In no event shall the arbitrators  enlarge upon, or alter or amend, this
Lease or  Lessor's  or  Lessee's  rights as  provided  in this  Lease,  it being
understood that the sole issue for determination by the arbitrators shall be the
single issue of fact of the Electric  Consumption in the Demised  Premises.  The
arbitrators  shall be  licensed  engineers  or  electrical  contractors  who are
disinterested and are currently  practicing in the Westchester  County, New York
area with at least ten (10) years experience in evaluating and auditing electric
consumption.

     G. Except as otherwise  provided in the  following  sentence,  the fees and
expenses of an arbitration proceeding shall be borne by the parties equally. The
fees of  respective  counsel  engaged by the  parties  the fees and  expenses of
expert witnesses and other witnesses called and the cost of transcripts shall be
borne by the parties  engaging  such counsel or calling such witness or ordering
such transcripts.

     SECTION 6.06.  Lessor reserves the right to stop,  interrupt and/or suspend
Utility Service and/or Electric  Service when necessary by reason of accident or
for repairs, alterations, replacements or improvements necessary or desirable in
the  judgement  of Lessor for as long as may be  reasonably  required  by reason
thereof.  The repairs,  alterations,  replacements or improvements shall be done
with a minimum of inconvenience  to Lessee and upon reasonable  notice to Lessee
(except  that no notice  shall be  required  in the event of an  emergency)  and
Lessor shall pursue same with due diligence.

     SECTION 6.07. The Lessor shall in no way be liable for any loss, damage, or
expense  which Lessee may incur as a result of the change,  at any time,  of the
character or quality of Electric Service or Utility Service or any failure of or
defect in Electric Service or Utility Service by reason of any public or private
utility  company then  supplying  such service to the Property,  Building or the
Demised  Premises and Lessee agrees to hold the Lessor harmless and to indemnify
it from and  against  any loss,  liability  or damage  in  connection  therewith
resulting  from Lessee's  negligent or wilful acts or omissions.  This indemnity
shall survive the expiration or other termination of this Lease.

                        ARTICLE 7- REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

     SECTION  7.01.A.  Subject to the provisions of Section 7.02 hereof,  Lessee
shall, during the Term of this Lease and any Renewal Term, at Lessee's sole cost
and  expense,  take good care of,  maintain  and make all  repairs,  (other than
structural) in the Demised Premises,  and the fixtures and equipment therein and
appurtenances  thereto,  including  but  not  limited  to,  internal  doors  and
entrances, door checks, internal signs, floor covering,  interior walls, columns
and  partitions;  and  lighting,  heating,  hot  water,  plumbing  and  sewerage
facilities  located  within the Demised  Premises  and serving  only the Demised
Premises,  the portion of the sprinkler  system and sprinkler heads serving only
the Demised Premises;  and supplemental air conditioning  units, if any, located
within the Demised Premises and serving only the Demised Premises.

     B. If Lessee  refuses or  neglects to clean,  maintain  or make  repairs or
otherwise  fails to perform any of Lessee's  repairs or maintenance  obligations
hereunder, Lessor shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to make such
repairs or perform on behalf of and for the account of Lessee.  All sums so paid
by Lessor in  connection  with the  payment or  performance  by it or any of the
obligations of Lessee  hereunder and all actual and reasonable  costs,  expenses
and  disbursements  paid in connection  therewith or enforcing or endeavoring to
enforce any right under or in  connection  with this Lease,  or pursuant to law,
together  with interest  thereon at the maximum  legal rate from the  respective
dates of the making of such payment, shall constitute Additional Rent payable by
Lessee  under  this Lease and shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor  upon  demand by
Lessor.  The  provisions of this Section  shall survive the  expiration or other
termination of this Lease.

     SECTION  7.02.  Except to the  extent  caused by the acts or  omissions  of
Lessee, or Lessee's agents, contractors, subcontractors, employees, or invitees,
Lessor shall be required to make all necessary structural repairs to the Demised
Premises  and/or  Building,  repairs to the Building  Equipment (as  hereinafter
defined)  and for  damage  caused by a  casualty  or  Lessor's  negligent  acts,
excluding Lessee's property.  Lessor shall during the Term of this Lease and any
Renewal Term, operate, maintain and repair all common areas and other facilities
in or about the  Property  and/or the  Building,  exclusive  of interior  doors,
interior door frames, interior door checks, interior windows and interior window
frames.  Lessor  shall  construct,  maintain and operate the common areas of the
Building and Property as a first class office  building in  Westchester  County,
New York, and Lessor shall have full right and authority to employ and discharge
all personnel  with respect  thereto.  If Lessor shall  designate an employee or
lessee parking area or areas, Lessee and its employees shall use only such areas
for parking and Lessee  shall  cooperate  fully with  Lessor in  enforcing  this
covenant.

     SECTION   7.03.   "Repairs"   as  used  herein   shall  mean  all  repairs,
replacements,  renewals,  alterations,  additions and betterments. All contracts
between  Lessee and others  for  installations,  maintenance,  and  repairs  and
alterations involving the Demised Premises,  including  maintenance  agreements,
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lessor, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

     SECTION  7.04.  Lessor  shall  not be  required  to  make  any  repairs  or
replacements to the common areas  occasioned by the act or negligence of Lessee,
its agents, employees, invitees, customers, licensees, or contractors, except to
the extent  that Lessor is  reimbursed  therefor  under any policy of  insurance
permitting waiver of liability and containing a waiver of subrogation, except as
otherwise provided in this Article and Article 12 of this Lease.

     ARTICLE 8- LESSEE'S WORK; ALTERATION FUND; SUPPLEMENTAL ALTERATION FUND

     SECTION  8.01.  Lessee  acknowledges  that Lessor shall have no  obligation
whatsoever  to perform any  build-out or similar work to Demised  Premises,  and
Lessee  agrees to accept same in "AS IS"  physical  order and  condition  on the
respective  commencement  dates and  without  any  representation  or  warranty,
express or  implied,  in fact or by law,  by Lessor,  and  without  recourse  to
Lessor,  as to the nature,  condition or  usability  thereof or as to the use or
occupancy which may be made thereof.

     SECTION 8.02.A. Following the Commencement Date, Lessee shall build-out and
fully  equip with all trade and  operating  fixtures  and  equipment,  plumbing,
lighting  and  other  fixtures  and  equipment,  furniture,  furnishings,  floor
covering,  and any and all other items  necessary  for the proper  operation  of
Lessee's business in the Demised Premises  ("Lessee's  Work").  All fixtures and
equipment  permanently  affixed  to the  Demised  Premises  in  connection  with
Lessee's  Work  shall not be  subject  to liens,  conditional  sales  contracts,
security  agreements or chattel mortgages.  Lessee shall complete or cause to be
completed  all of Lessee's Work required on Lessee's part to be performed in and
at  the  Demised  Premises  under  this  Lease  pursuant  to  Lessor's  Standard
Requirements  For  Alterations  To Be Performed By Lessees,'  annexed  hereto as
EXHIBIT "G."

     B.1.  Lessee  agrees that  Lessor's  designated  general  contractor  shall
perform the Demolition  Portion (as hereinafter  defined) of Lessee's Work only,
provided that such general contractor can perform the same within the time frame
reasonably  requested by Lessee. As used herein "Demolition  Portion" shall mean
the demolition of the entire Demised  Premises,  including,  but not limited to;
(x)  removal of all high  voltage  and low  voltage  electric  wires,  conduits,
sockets,   transformers,   etc.;  (y)  the   requirements  of  all  Governmental
Authorities  having  jurisdiction  over Lessee's  Work; and (z) carting away all
debris form the Demised Premises,  Building and/or Property, as the case may be.
The cost of the Demolition Portion of Lessee's Work performed by Lessor shall be
at competitive  rates and mutually  agreed upon by Robert P. Weisz, on behalf of
Lessor, and either Peter May or Nelson Peltz, on behalf of Lessee.

     2. Lessee hereby agrees that Lessor shall be entitled to a supervision  fee
equal to Sixty  Thousand  and  00/100  ($60,000.00)  Dollars  to  supervise  and
coordinate the Base Building  Portion (as hereinafter  defined) of Lessee's Work
("Lessor's Supervision Fee"),  provided,  however, that Lessee agrees to use one
of Lessor's  recommended  subcontractors  for the heating,  ventilating  and air
conditioning,  electrical,  sprinkler and fire alarm portion of Lessee's Work as
more  particularly  set forth on  EXHIBIT  "H"  annexed  hereto  and made a part
hereof,  provided that the  recommended  sub  contractors  can perform such work
within a time frame reasonably requested by Lessee and are competitively priced.
Lessor's  Supervision Fee shall be payable upon  substantial  completion of that
portion of Lessee's Work giving rise to Lessor's  Supervision  Fee as Additional
Rent. Any and all  supervision  and/or  coordination  by Lessor of Lessee's Work
shall in no way  obligate  Lessor in any  manner  whatsoever  in  respect to the
finished product designed and/or constructed by Lessee. Any deficiency in design
or construction in Lessee's Work, shall be solely the  responsibility of Lessee.
Except for Lessor's  Supervision  Fee,  Lessor  agrees not to charge  Lessee for
security persons, hoists, freight elevators, or access to the Building's loading
docks, or moving into the Demised  Premises during Normal Working Hours.  Lessee
agrees that it shall be  responsible  for payment of all  Electric  Service used
and/or  consumed in the Demised  Premises  during Lessee's Work in the amount of
Twelve Thousand,  One Hundred and Thirty-Six and 67/100 ($12,136.67) Dollars per
month or portion  thereof,  payable  in  advance on the first  (1st) day of each
month  commencing  on the  Commencement  Date.  As used herein,  "Base  Building
Portion"  shall mean all  portions of Lessee's  Work,  other than the  finishes,
cabinetry, wall coverings and flooring. In the event that Lessee requires Lessor
to provide  supervision and/or  construction  management fees for other than the
Base  Building  Portion  of  Lessee's  Work,  Lessee  agrees to pay  Lessor  its
reasonable  and  customary  fee to provide such services to other tenants in the
Building.

     C.  All  construction  and  transportation  of  construction   material  in
connection  with the  performance of Lessee's  Work,  shall be performed only by
contractors and/or  subcontractors  having collective bargaining agreements with
unions  affiliated with the Building and Construction  Trades  Department of the
AFL-CIO.  Thirty (30) days prior to commencement of Lessee's Work,  Lessee shall
provide Lessor with a list of names of the general contractor and subcontractors
for  submission  by the  holder of the  Mortgage  to the local  Building  Trades
Council for  verification  as to their current  status with the Building  Trades
Department.  All  construction  contracts in connection  with Lessee's Work must
require that the contractor and all  subcontractors  affirmatively  agree to pay
prevailing wages and fringe benefits to the appropriate employee benefit plan in
accordance with the collective bargaining agreement in force on the construction
site.

     SECTION  8.03.A.1.  Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.03,  Lessor
shall  contribute an amount not to exceed Two Million,  One Hundred and Eighteen
Thousand,  Four Hundred and 00/100  ($2,118,400.00)  Dollars towards the cost of
the  performance  of Lessee's Work,  including  fees of  architects,  engineers,
expediters,  consultants  and other soft costs  incurred by Lessee in connection
with the performance of Lessee's Work (the "Alteration Fund").

     2. In addition to the Alteration Fund, Lessor agrees to provide Lessee with
an additional sum not to exceed One Million,  Fifty-Nine  Thousand,  Two Hundred
and 00/100 ($1,059,200.00) Dollars (the "Supplemental  Alteration Fund") towards
the cost of the  performance of Lessee's Work,  exclusive of fees of architects,
engineers,  expediters,  consultants  and other soft costs incurred by Lessee in
connection with the performance of the Lessee's Work.

     B. Lessor shall make Proportionate  Disbursements (as hereinafter  defined)
from Alteration Fund and  Supplemental  Alteration  Fund, as the case may be, to
Lessee from time to time, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the items set
forth in Section 8.03.C.  hereof,  provided that such request is received by the
Lessor by the tenth  (10th) day of the calendar  month in which Lessor  receives
such request, and further provided that on the date of a request and on the date
of disbursement  from the respective  alteration fund, no Event of Default shall
have  occurred or be  continuing.  Disbursements  from the  Alteration  Fund and
Supplemental  Alteration  Fund,  shall not be made more frequently than monthly,
and shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate  amounts  theretofore  paid (as
certified by Lessee's chief financial officer and Lessee's  independent licensed
architect) to Lessee's  contractors,  subcontractors  and materialman which have
not been the  subject of  previous  disbursement  from the  Alteration  Fund and
Supplemental Alteration Fund, as the case may be. As used herein, "Proportionate
Disbursement"  shall  mean  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is the  amount
requested from the Alteration Fund and Supplemental Alteration Fund, as the case
may be, and the denominator of which is the total cost of Lessee's Work.

     C. Lessor's obligation to make disbursements from the respective alteration
funds shall be subject to receipt of: (a) a request for such  disbursement  from
the specified fund from Lessee signed by the chief financial  officer of Lessee,
together with the certification  required by Section 8.03.C.  hereof; (b) copies
of all  receipts,  invoices  and  bills  for the work  completed  and  materials
furnished in connection  with Lessee's  Work and  incorporated  into the Demised
Premises;  (c)  copies of all  contracts  (to the extent  not  already  given to
Lessor),  work orders, change orders and other documents relating to the work or
materials;  (d) a certificate of Lessee's independent licensed architect stating
(i) that, in his opinion, the portion of the Lessee's Work theretofore completed
and for  which  the  disbursement  is  requested  was  performed  in a good  and
workmanlike   manner  in   accordance   with  the  final   detailed   plans  and
specifications  for Lessee's Work as approved by Lessor;  (ii) the percentage of
completion  of Lessee's Work as of the date of such  certificate,  and (iii) the
estimated  total cost to complete the performance of Lessee's Work; and (e) lien
waivers, to the extent permitted by law, from each contractor, subcontractor and
materialmen  who  performed  work in  connection  with the Lessee's  Work to the
extent of the  amount  theretofore  paid to such  contractor,  subcontractor  or
materialman.

     D. In no event shall the  aggregate  amount paid by Lessor to Lessee  under
this  Section  8.03 exceed the amount of the  Alteration  Fund and  Supplemental
Alteration  Fund,  as the  case  may be.  Upon the  disbursement  of the  entire
Alteration  Fund and  Supplemental  Alteration  Fund, as the case may be, Lessor
shall have no further  obligation or liability  whatsoever to Lessee for further
disbursement of any portion of the Alteration Fund and  Supplemental  Alteration
Fund, as the case may be, to Lessee. It is expressly  understood and agreed that
Lessee shall complete at its sole cost and expense,  Lessee's  Work,  whether or
not the Alteration Fund and Supplemental Alteration Fund, as the case may be, is
sufficient  to fund such  completion.  Any costs to  complete  Lessee's  Work in

<PAGE>

excess of the Alteration Fund shall be the sole responsibility and obligation of
Lessee.

     E. Within  forty-five  (45) days after  completion  of the  Lessee's  Work,
Lessee  shall  deliver to Lessor  final  waivers  of lien from all  contractors,
subcontractors and materialmen  involved in performance of the Lessee's Work and
supply of material  furnished in connection  therewith,  and a certificate  from
Lessee's  independent  licensed architect certifying that (i) in his opinion the
Lessee's Work has been performed in a good and workmanlike  manner and completed
in accordance with the final detailed plans and specifications for such Lessee's
Work as approved by the Lessor,  and (ii) all  contractors,  subcontractors  and
materialmen have been paid for the Lessee's Work and materials furnished through
such date.

     F. Prior to the commencement of the Lessee's Work, (i) Lessee shall provide
Lessor with copies of all contracts with contractors, subcontractors who will be
performing  the Lessee's  Work,  and (ii) Lessor shall approve  (which  approval
shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld)  the  schedule  of  payments  to be  made
thereunder.

     G. Lessee  shall  maintain  comprehensive  records and copies of all plans,
specifications,  budgets and other appropriate  documentation in connection with
any and all  Lessee's  Work,  copies of which shall be  furnished to Lessor upon
demand.

     H.  Lessor  hereby   acknowledges  that  Lessee  may  elect,  in  its  sole
discretion,  to use all or any  portion  of the  Supplemental  Alteration  Fund,
provided,  however,  that  Lessee  shall  notify  Lessor in writing on or before
November  15, 2005,  time being of the essence with respect to said date,  as to
what portion of the  Supplemental  Alteration  Fund that Lessee  intends to use.
Lessor  hereby  agrees that on the Rent  Commencement  Date,  to the extent that
Lessee does not use all of the  Supplemental  Alteration  Fund for Lessee's Work
(the  portion of the  Supplemental  Alteration  Fund not being used  hereinafter
called the "Unused Supplemental Alteration Fund"), then in such event, the Fixed
Rent provided for in Section 2.01 of this Lease shall be reduced each year by an
amount equal to the product of: (i) the Unused Supplemental Alteration Fund; and
(ii) No  Dollars  and  1384/10000  ($0.1384)  Dollars  (the  "Annual  Alteration
Credit").  Lessee  hereby  acknowledges  and agrees that from and after the Rent
Commencement  Date,  Lessee  shall not be  entitled  to the Unused  Supplemental
Alteration Fund.

     SECTION  8.04.  Other than as  specifically  provided  for in Section  8.03
hereof, Lessee shall not do any construction, work or alterations to the Demised
Premises,  nor shall Lessee install any items other than Lessee's trade fixtures
without first: (1) obtaining  Lessor's written consent,  which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed, and (2) complying with all of
the terms,  covenants and conditions contained in Lessor's Standard Requirements
For  Alterations To Be Performed by Lessees',  annexed hereto as EXHIBIT "G," as
may be amended from time to time.

                         ARTICLE 9- COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

     SECTION 9.01. Lessor represents that the Demised Premises, the Building and
Property  will  comply  with  all  Legal  Requirements,  Environmental  Laws and
Insurance  Requirements as of the Commencement  Date,  provided,  however,  that
Lessor shall not be required to make any  modifications  or  alterations  to the
Demised Premises, Building and/or Property required by reason of Lessee's Work.

     SECTION  9.02.  Throughout  the Term of this Lease,  Lessee shall  promptly
comply  with  all  Legal   Requirements,   Environmental   Laws  and   Insurance
Requirements,  with  respect  to the  Demised  Premises,  whether  or  not  such
compliance  involves  structural repairs or changes or be required on account of
any  particular  use to which the Demised  Premises,  or any part, may be put by
Lessee,  other  than  general  office  use,  and  whether  or not any such Legal
Requirements, Environmental Laws, or Insurance Requirements be of a kind not now
within the contemplation of the parties hereto.  Compliance by Lessee with Legal
Requirements,  Environmental  Laws,  and  Insurance  Requirements  shall  be  at
Lessee's  sole cost and  expense.  Lessee shall not contest the  application  or
validity  of any such  Legal  Requirements,  Environmental  Laws,  or  Insurance
Requirements  without the prior written consent of Lessor in each such instance,
which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned  or  delayed,
provided,  however,  that (i) such  contest  shall not result in Lessor being in
default under any Superior  Mortgages or Leases;  (ii) does not impose any civil
or criminal liability on Lessor's officers, directors, shareholders or partners;
(iii) Lessee agrees to pay any and all fines and/or penalties incurred, assessed
or levied in connection with such contest; and (iv) Lessee shall and does hereby
indemnify and hold harmless Lessor,  and Lessor's agents,  officers,  directors,
and  employees,  from and against  any and all loss,  liability,  fines,  suits,
claims,  obligations,  damages,  penalties,  demands and actions,  and costs and
reasonable expenses of any kind or nature (including reasonable  architects' and
attorneys'  fees) due to or arising  out of such  contest.  Any repair or change
required under this Section shall be deemed a repair for the purposes of Article
7. With  respect  to  actions  necessary  to  comply  with  Legal  Requirements,
Insurance  Requirements and  Environmental  Laws which due to their nature,  can
only be taken by Lessor, Lessor, at Lessee's expense, will cooperate with Lessee
in facilitating such compliance.

                      ARTICLE 10- RIGHTS RESERVED TO LESSOR

     SECTION  10.01.  Lessee  shall  permit  Lessor,  Lessor's  agents,  and its
invitees to enter the Demised Premises,  or any part thereof,  at all reasonable
times provided same does not unreasonably interfere with Lessee's business and a
representative of Lessee is present for the purposes of (a) inspecting the same,
(b) curing  Events of Default of Lessee  (after Ten (10) days  notice to Lessee,
except that no notice  shall be required in case of an  emergency),  (c) showing
the same to  mortgagees,  appraisers,  or  prospective  lenders,  purchasers  or
showing the same to  prospective  lessees  during the last six (6) months of the
Term or any  Renewal  Term,  (d)  observing  the  performance  by  Lessee of its
obligations  under this Lease,  (e) performing any act or thing which Lessor may
be obligated or have the right to do under this Lease or otherwise,  and (f) any
other reasonable purpose.  Lessor and any providers of Utility Services or other
services  shall  have  the  right  to  maintain  existing  utility,  mechanical,
electrical and other systems and to enter upon the Demised Premises to make such
repairs and alterations  therein or in or to the Demised Premises as may, in the
reasonable opinion of Lessor, be deemed necessary or advisable. Lessor shall not
be liable for  inconvenience,  annoyance,  disturbance  or loss of  business  to
Lessee or any  sublessee by reason of making any repairs or the  performance  of
any work,  or on account of bringing  materials,  tools,  supplies and equipment
into  or  through  the  Demised  Premises  during  the  course  thereof  and the
obligations of Lessee under this Lease shall not be affected thereby. The rights
provided in this Article shall be exercised so as to minimize  interference with
the use and  occupancy  of the Demised  Premises by Lessee and all work shall be
diligently prosecuted to completion by Lessor. Nothing contained in this Article
shall  impose,  or shall be  construed  to impose on Lessor  any  obligation  to
maintain  the  systems  referred to in this  Article or the Demised  Premises or
anything  appurtenant  thereto,  or to make  repairs or  alterations  thereof or
thereto, or to create any liability for any failure to do so.

     SECTION 10.02.A.  Without  abatement or diminution in rent, Lessor reserves
and shall have the following additional rights: (a) to change the street address
and/or the name of the Building of which the Demised  Premises are a part and/or
the Property and/or the locations of entrances,  passageways,  doors,  doorways,
corridors,  elevators,  stairs,  toilets,  or other public parts of the Building
and/or Property without  liability to Lessee provided that access to the Demised
Premises is not adversely affected thereby, (b) to reasonably approve in writing
all sources  furnishing  construction  work,  painting,  decorating,  repairing,
maintenance and any other work in or about the Demised  Premises,  (c) to erect,
use and maintain pipes and conduits in and through the Demised Premises provided
that they are behind the walls or above the dropped  ceilings,  (d) to charge to
Lessee any expense including  overtime cost incurred by Lessor in the event that
repairs, alterations,  decorating or other work in the Demised Premises are made
or done after ordinary business hours at Lessee's  request,  and (e) to grant to
anyone the exclusive right to conduct any particular  business or undertaking in
the Building of which the Demised Premises are a part.

     B. Lessor may exercise any or all of the foregoing  rights hereby  reserved
to Lessor without being deemed guilty of an eviction, actual or constructive, or
disturbance  or  interruption  of Lessee's use or  possession  and without being
liable in any manner toward  Lessee and without  limitation or abatement of rent
or other compensation, and such acts shall have no effect on this Lease.

     SECTION  10.03.A.  Lessor  hereby agrees that it will not name the Building
for any of Lessee's herein named, or its successors by merger, sale of assets or
otherwise,  direct  competitors  on the date  that  Lessor  notifies  Lessee  in
writing,  pursuant  to  Article  21 of this  Lease,  that it  seeks  to name the
Building. Lessee herein named shall, within ten (10) business days after receipt
of the notice from Lessor that it intends to name the Building,  provide  Lessor
with names of its direct  competitors(time  being of the essence with respect to
said ten (10)  business day  period).  Lessee's  herein named  failure to notify
Lessor within the ten (10) business day period shall be deemed Lessee's  consent
to Lessor to name the Building.

     B. Subject to the  provisions of Section  10.03.A.,  Lessor hereby  further
agrees  that it will not name the  Building  for any tenant who has less  square
footage  than  Lessee  and does not  occupy  at least  one  third or more of the
rentable square footage of the Building.

                              ARTICLE 11- INSURANCE

     SECTION  11.01.  A. Lessee  shall  obtain and keep in full force and effect
during the Term,  and during any earlier  period of time when Lessee or Lessee's
agents,  employees,  or contractors  may enter the Demised  Premises and/or Roof
Deck (as hereinafter defined) at its own cost and expense:

     (1) commercial  general liability  insurance (with a contractual  liability
endorsement  covering  the  matters  set forth in Article  16) having a combined
single limit of not less than Three Million  ($3,000,000.00)  Dollars protecting
Lessor,  any  Lessor's  agent  which is acting  as a  property  manager  for the
Property,  the holder of any  Mortgage,  or lessor under any Superior  Lease and
Lessee as insureds  (and  naming  each such person as an insured  party or as an
additional  insured)  against  any and all claims for  bodily  injury,  death or
property damage occurring, during the Term and during any earlier period of time
when Lessee or Lessee's agents,  employees, or contractors may enter the Demised
Premises and/or Roof Deck;

     (2) insurance  (herein  sometimes  referred to as "Lessee's fire (casualty)
insurance")  against loss or damage by any and all risks and hazards to Lessee's
Property  (as  hereinafter  defined)  for the  full  replacement  value  thereof
(including  coverages  which are currently  sometimes  referred to as "all risk"
with coverage written on a replacement cost basis);

     (3) workers'  compensation and employees  liability insurance in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York and all Governmental  Authorities  having
jurisdiction over the Demised Premises, Roof Deck and/or the Property; and

     (4) If there is a steam boiler,  steam generator,  or any other combustible
device,  mechanism  or  appliance  in,  on,  adjoining  or beneath  the  Demised
Premises,  for the  exclusive  use of the Lessee,  Lessee  shall insure and keep
insured in the name of Lessee, with the name of Lessor included as an additional
insured,  at Lessee's  expense a broad form boiler insurance in the amount of at
least Five Hundred Thousand ($500,000.00) Dollars.  Lessee shall further insure,
at Lessor's  request,  against any other peril  generally  insured  against by a
business of Lessee's type.

     B.  Said  insurance  is to be  written  in form  and  substance  reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor by an insurance  company,  licensed to do business in the
State of New York,  which shall be rated by Best's Insurance Rating Service with
at least a rating  equal to A-:VIII.  Lessee shall  procure,  maintain and place
such insurance and pay all premiums and charges  therefor and upon failure to do
so Lessor may, but shall not be obligated to,  procure,  maintain and place such
insurance  or make such  payments,  and in such event  Lessee  agrees to pay the
amount  thereof  plus  interest at the maximum  legal rate then  prevailing,  to
Lessor on demand as Additional  Rent. If Lessee has other locations that it owns
or leases,  said policy  shall  include an aggregate  per location  endorsement.
Lessee shall cause to be included in all such insurance policies (i) a provision
to the  effect  that the same  will not be  canceled  except  upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Lessor, and (ii) a provision to the
effect that the naming of any person  other than Lessee as an insured  shall not
obligate  such person to pay any premium.  Each such  Lessee's  fire  (casualty)
insurance  policy  shall  contain an  agreement  by the insurer  that the act or
omission of one insured will not  invalidate the policy as to any other insured.
Not  less  than ten  (10)  days  prior  to the  Commencement  Date the  original
insurance  policies or  appropriate  certificates  and paid  receipts  therefor,
(together  with a photocopy of the policy,  if Lessor shall so request) shall be
deposited  with  Lessor.  Any  renewals or  endorsements  thereto  shall also be
deposited with Lessor,  not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration date
of the  policy  being  renewed,  replaced  or  endorsed,  to the end  that  said
insurance shall be in full force and effect at all times during the Term.

     SECTION 11.02.  Lessee agrees to use reasonable  efforts to include in each
of its insurance  policies  (insuring the Demised Premises and Lessor's property
therein,  against  loss  occasioned  by fire or other  casualty) a waiver of the
insurer's right of subrogation  against the Lessor,  or if such waiver should be
unobtainable or  unenforceable,  (a) an express agreement that such policy shall
not be  invalidated  if the insured waives or has waived before the casualty the
right of recovery  against any party  responsible for a casualty  covered by the
policy,  or (b) any other form of permission for the release of the other party,
or (c) the  inclusion  of the  Lessor as an  additional  insured.  Lessee,  upon
request from Lessor from time to time,  will  furnish  evidence of the nature of
the insurance arrangements made concerning the subject matter of this Section.

     SECTION 11.03. As long as both parties' fire (casualty)  insurance policies
then in force  include the waiver of  subrogation  or agreement or permission to
release  liability  referred  to in Section  11.02 or name the other party as an
additional  insured,  each party  hereby  waives  (and agrees to cause any other
permitted  occupants of the Demised Premises to execute and deliver to the other
party  written  instruments  waiving)  any right of  recovery  against the other
party,  the  holder  of the  Mortgage,  or  Superior  Lease,  and any  servants,
employees,  agents or contractors  of the other party,  or of any such lessor or
holder,  or of any such other tenants or occupants,  for any loss  occasioned by
fire or other  casualty,  that is an insured risk under Lessee's fire (casualty)
insurance policies. In the event that at any time either party's fire (casualty)
insurance  carriers  shall not include such or similar  provisions  in the other
party's  fire  (casualty)  insurance  policies,  the  waivers  set  forth in the
foregoing  sentence  shall be deemed of no further force and effect.  During any
period when either party fails to maintain such fire (casualty)  insurance,  for
the purposes of the first  sentence of this Section  there shall be deemed to be
in effect  such fire  (casualty)  insurance  meeting  the  requirements  of such
sentence.

     SECTION 11.04.  Nothing contained in this Lease shall (i) relieve Lessee of
any liability to Lessor or to its insurance carriers which Lessee may have under
law or the provisions of this Lease in connection with any damage to the Demised
Premises by fire or other casualty;  (ii) impose upon Lessor any duty to procure
or maintain any kinds of insurance  or any  particular  amounts or limits of any
such kinds of insurance.

     SECTION  11.05.  Lessor shall insure the Building  with all risk  insurance
coverage in such amounts so as to avoid co-insurance and Lessor agrees that such
policies shall contain a waiver of subrogation in favor of Lessee.

                       ARTICLE 12 - DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION

     SECTION 12.01. If the Demised Premises or any part thereof shall be damaged
by fire or other casualty, Lessee shall give prompt notice thereof to Lessor and
Lessor shall proceed (subject to the provisions of this Article) with reasonable
diligence  to repair or cause to be repaired  such  damage,  including,  without
limitation  all  Building  systems  located in the Demised  Premises  and all of
Lessee's  improvements  to the Demised  Premises.  Except as provided in Section
12.05,  the Fixed Rent shall be abated  proportionately  to the extent  that the
Demised Premises shall have been rendered Untenantable (as hereinafter defined),
such abatement to be from the date of such damage or destruction to the date the
Demised Premises shall no longer be Untenantable.

     SECTION 12.02. If the Demised Premises,  including,  without limitation all
Building   systems  located  in  the  Demised   Premises  and  all  of  Lessee's
improvements to the Demised  Premises shall be rendered  Untenantable by fire or
other  casualty,  and Lessor has not  terminated  this Lease pursuant to Section
12.03 and  Lessor  has not  completed  the making of the  required  repairs  and
restored and rebuilt the Demised  Premises  and/or access thereto within one (1)
year from the date of such damage or  destruction  to the  condition the Demised
Premises  were in on the date  preceding  such  casualty  (except  for  Lessee's
Property),  and such  additional  time  after  such  date,  as shall  equal  the
aggregate period Lessor may have been delayed in doing so by Unavoidable  Delays
or adjustment  of insurance,  Lessee may serve notice on Lessor of its intention
to terminate this Lease and if within thirty (30) days thereafter,  Lessor shall
not have substantially completed the making of the required repairs and restored
and rebuilt the Demised  Premises to the condition the Demised  Premises were in
on the date preceding such casualty (except for Lessee's Property), then in such
events,  this Lease shall  terminate on the  expiration  of such thirty (30) day
period as if such  termination date were the Expiration Date, and the Fixed Rent
and Additional  Rent shall be apportioned as of such date of sooner  termination
and any prepaid  portion of Fixed Rent and Additional  Rent for any period after
such date shall be refunded by Lessor to Lessee.

     SECTION  12.03.A.  If more than  sixty  (60%)  percent of  rentable  square
footage of the Building shall be rendered Untenantable by fire or other casualty
that  substantial  alteration or  reconstruction  shall, in Lessor's  reasonable
opinion,  be  required,  then and in such  events  Lessor  may,  at its  option,
terminate this Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted by giving Lessee not
less than  thirty  (30) days,  nor more than  sixty  (60)  days,  notice of such
termination,  within  ninety (90) days after the date of such damage,  provided,
however,  that Lessor terminates the leases of all other tenants in the Building
who are similarly  situated.  In the event that such notice of termination shall
be given,  this Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted shall  terminate as
of the date  provided  in such  notice of  termination  (whether or not the Term
shall have commenced) with the same effect as if that were the Expiration  Date,
and the Fixed Rent and  Additional  Rent shall be apportioned as of such date of
sooner  termination,  and any prepaid  portion of Fixed Rent and Additional Rent
for any period after such date shall be refunded by Lessor to Lessee.

     B. If the  Demised  Premises  shall  be  totally  damaged  or the  whole or
substantially all of the Demised Premises shall be rendered untenantable by fire
or other  casualty,  and Lessor has not  terminated  this Lease as  provided  in
Section 12.03.A., Lessor shall notify Lessee, within ninety (90) days after such
fire or other casualty, as to the estimated period of time necessary to complete
the  required  repairs and  restore  and  rebuild  the  Demised  Premises to the
condition  the Demised  Premises  were in on the date  preceding  such  casualty
(except for Lessee's Property).  If such Lessor's estimate exceeds one (1) year,
from the date of such casualty,  or if Lessor falls to deliver such notice, then
in such  events,  Lessee may serve on  Lessor,  within  thirty  (30) days of its
receipt of Lessor's notice, or the expiration of the ninety (90) days after such
fire or other  casualty,  as the case may be,  (time being of the  essence  with
respect  thereto),  notice of its  intention to  terminate  this Lease on a date
which shall be not more than thirty (30) days from the date of Lessee's  notice.
If Lessee gives notice of its intention to cancel this Lease as provided herein,
then in such events, this Lease shall terminate on the expiration of such thirty
(30) day period as if such  termination  date were the Expiration  Date, and the
Fixed Rent and  Additional  Rent shall be  apportioned as of such date of sooner
termination  and any prepaid  portion of Fixed Rent and Additional  Rent for any
period after such date shall be refunded by Lessor to Lessee.  Lessee's  failure
to notify  Lessor  within the thirty (30) day period shall be deemed a waiver of
the right to terminate this Lease.

     SECTION  12.04.  Lessor  shall  not be  liable  for  any  inconvenience  or
annoyance  to Lessee or injury to the  business of Lessee  resulting  in any way
from such damage by fire or other casualty or the repair thereof.

     SECTION  12.05.  Except as otherwise  specifically  provided for in Section
12.01 of this Lease, Lessee shall restore all improvements made by Lessee to the
Demised  Premises,  at Lessee's sole cost and expense.  Nothing herein contained
shall  relieve  Lessee from any  liability  to the Lessor or to its  insurers in
connection with any damage to the Property, Building or Demised Premises by fire
or other  casualty  if Lessee  shall be  legally  liable in such  respect to the
extent same is not covered by Lessee's insurance required to be maintained under
this Lease.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article, if
by  reason  of some  action  or  inaction  on the part of  Lessee  or any of its
employees, agents, officers,  directors or contractors,  Lessor or the holder of
the Mortgage or Superior  Lease shall be unable to collect all of the  insurance
proceeds (including rent insurance proceeds) applicable to damage or destruction
of the Demised Premises by fire or other cause,  then,  without prejudice to any
other remedy which may be available against Lessee,  the abatement of Fixed Rent
provided  for in this  Article  shall  not be  effective  to the  extent  of the
uncollected insurance proceeds.

     SECTION 12.06.  This Lease shall be considered an express  agreement to the
contrary  pursuant to New York Real  Property Law Section 227 governing any case
of damage to or destruction of the Demised  Premises or any part thereof by fire
or other  casualty,  and any law providing for such a contingency in the absence
of such express agreement,  now or hereafter enacted,  shall have no application
in such case to the extent inconsistent with this Lease.

     SECTION  12.07.  Lessee shall,  at its own cost and expense,  remove all of
Lessee's  property from the Demised Premises as Lessor shall require in order to
repair and restore the Demised  Premises  and Lessor  shall not be  obligated to
commence  repairs or restoration of the Demised Premises until such property has
been removed by Lessee from the damaged portion of the Demised Premises.  Should
Lessee neglect,  fail, or refuse to remove its aforesaid  property within thirty
(30) days after such damage or  destruction,  the  provisions  for  abatement of
Fixed  Rent  contained  herein  shall be  suspended  and of no force and  effect
whatsoever until Lessee has completed such removal. In no event shall the Lessor
be  required  to  repair  or  replace  Lessee's  merchandise,   trade  fixtures,
furniture, furnishings, inventory and equipment.

                 ARTICLE 13 - CURING DEFAULTS; FEES AND EXPENSES

     SECTION 13.01.  If Lessee shall default in the full and prompt  performance
of any covenant  contained herein and to be performed on Lessee's part,  Lessor,
after all applicable notice and cure periods as otherwise  specifically provided
for herein (except that a lesser notice  appropriate to the circumstances  shall
be required in case of an  emergency),  without being under any obligation to do
so and without  thereby  waiving such default may perform such  covenant for the
account and at the expense of Lessee and may enter upon the Demised Premises for
any such purpose and take all action thereon as may be necessary  therefor.  All
sums so paid by Lessor in connection  with the payment or  performance  by it of
any of the obligations of Lessee hereunder and all actual and reasonable  costs,
expenses  and  disbursements  paid  in  connection  therewith  or  enforcing  or
endeavoring  to enforce any right  under or in  connection  with this Lease,  or
pursuant to law,  together with interest  thereon at the maximum legal rate from
the  respective  dates of the  making of each  such  payment,  shall  constitute
Additional  Rent  payable by Lessee under this Lease and shall be paid by Lessee
to Lessor upon demand by Lessor.  The  provisions  of this Section shall survive
the expiration or other termination of this Lease.

                         ARTICLE 14 - DEFAULT PROVISIONS

     SECTION 14.01.  A. If any one or more of the following  events shall happen
and shall  not have  been  cured  within  any  applicable  grace  period  herein
provided:

     (1) if default shall be made in the due and punctual  payment of Fixed Rent
or Additional Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease when and as the same shall
become due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of ten (10)
days after written notice  thereof from Lessor to Lessee  (provided that no such
notice  shall be  required  if,  during the  period of one (1) year  immediately
preceding the date of default,  there shall have been three (3) or more defaults
in the due and  punctual  payment of Fixed Rent or  Additional  Rent  payable by
Lessee  under this Lease when and as the same shall have been due and  payable);
or

     (2) if default  shall be made by Lessee in  performance  of, or  compliance
with, any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained in this Lease and
either  (i) in the  case of a  default  or a  contingency  which  can  with  due
diligence be cured within thirty (30) days,  such default  shall  continue for a
period of thirty (30) days after written  notice  thereof from Lessor to Lessee,
or  (ii) in the  case of a  default  or a  contingency  which  cannot  with  due
diligence be cured within  thirty (30) days,  Lessee shall fail,  after  written
notice  thereof from Lessor,  to proceed  promptly and with all due diligence to
commence to cure the same and thereafter to prosecute the curing of such default
with all due diligence  (it being  intended  that, in connection  with a default
which is not  susceptible  of being cured with due diligence  within thirty (30)
days the time of Lessee within which to cure the same shall be extended for such
period as may be necessary for the curing thereof with all due diligence); or

     (3) if Lessee  shall file a voluntary  petition  seeking an order or relief
under  Title 11 of the United  States  Code or similar  law of any  jurisdiction
applicable  to Lessee,  or Lessee  shall be  adjudicated  a debtor,  bankrupt or
insolvent,  or shall  file any  petition  or answer  seeking,  consenting  to or
acquiescing in any order for relief, reorganization,  arrangement,  composition,
adjustment, winding-up, liquidation,  dissolution or similar relief with respect
to Lessee or its debts  under the  present or any future  bankruptcy  act or any
other present or future  applicable  federal,  state or other statute or law, or
shall file an answer admitting or failing to deny the material  allegations of a
petition  against it for any such  relief or shall  generally  not,  or shall be
unable  to, pay its debts as they  become  due or shall  admit in writing in any
filing with any court or Governmental  Authority its insolvency or its inability
to pay its debts as they become due, or shall make a general  assignment for the
benefit of creditors or shall seek or consent or acquiesce in the appointment of
any trustee, receiver, examiner, assignee, sequestrator, custodian or liquidator
or similar  official of Lessee or of all or any part of Lessee's  property or if
Lessee  shall  take any  action  in  furtherance  of or  authorizing  any of the
foregoing;  or if  Lessee  shall  call a  meeting  of,  or  propose  any form of
arrangement,  composition, extension or adjustment with, its creditors holding a
majority in amount of Lessee's outstanding indebtedness; or

     (4) if  any  case,  proceeding  or  other  action  shall  be  commenced  or
instituted against Lessee, seeking to adjudicate lessee a bankrupt or insolvent,
or seeking  an order for relief  against  Lessee as debtor,  or  reorganization,
arrangement,  composition,  adjustment, winding-up, liquidation,  dissolution or
similar  relief  with  respect to Lessee or its debts  under the  present or any
future bankruptcy act or any other present or future applicable  federal,  state
or other  statute  or law,  or seeking  appointment  of any  trustee,  receiver,
examiner, assignee, sequestrator, custodian or liquidator or similar official of
Lessee or of all or part of Lessee's  property,  which either (i) results in the
entry of an order for relief,  adjudication  of bankruptcy or insolvency or such
an appointment or the issuance or entry of any other order having similar effect
or (ii) remains  undismissed  for a period of ninety (90) days;  or if any case,
proceeding  or other  action shall be commenced  or  instituted  against  Lessee
seeking  issuance of a warrant of  execution,  attachment  restraint  or similar
process  against Lessee or any of Lessee's  property which results in the taking
or occupancy of the Demised Premises or an attempt to take or occupy the Demised
Premises  which  shall not have been  vacated,  discharged,  or stayed or bonded
pending appeal within ninety (90) days after the entry thereof; or

     (5) if any event shall occur or any  contingency  shall arise  whereby this
Lease or the estate hereby  granted to the unexpired  balance of the Term would,
by operation of law or otherwise,  devolve upon or pass to any person other than
Lessee,  except as is expressly  permitted under Article 27, or if default shall
be made by Lessee in the  performance  of, or compliance  with,  the  covenants,
agreements and conditions set forth in Article 27; or

     (6) if Lessee's  (other than Lessee  herein named)  obligations  under this
Lease shall have been guaranteed by any person other than Lessee and such person
shall default in observance or performance of any term, covenant or condition to
be observed  or  performed  by such person  under the  instrument  or  agreement
containing such guarantee; or

     (7) This Paragraph Has Been Intentionally Omitted; or

     (8) This Paragraph Has Been Intentionally Omitted; or

     (9) if  Lessee is the  subject  of a Chapter  11  reorganization  under the
Bankruptcy  Reform Act of 1978 and such  reorganization  is not confirmed within
eighteen  (18)  months  from the time of filing of a  voluntary  or  involuntary
petition  thereunder (it being  understood that in such event Lessee consents to
the  termination of the automatic  stay  provisions of Section 362 of such Act);
then and in any such event (hereinafter  sometimes called an "Event of Default")
Lessor may give written notice ("Termination  Notice") to Lessee specifying such
Event of Default or Events of Default and  stating  that this Lease and the Term
shall expire and  terminate on the date  specified  in the  Termination  Notice,
which  shall be at least  seven  (7) days  after the  giving of the  Termination
Notice, and on the date specified therein this Lease and the Term and all rights
of Lessee under this Lease shall expire and terminate, it being the intention of
the Lessor and Lessee hereby to create conditional limitations, and Lessee shall
remain liable as provided in Article 15 and in accordance with those  provisions
of this Lease which are specifically  stated herein to survive the expiration or
other termination of this Lease.

     B.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14.01.A, if there shall be an
Event of  Default  at any time or from  time to time  under  the  provisions  of
subdivision (1) of Section 14.01.A,  Lessor may, in lieu of giving a Termination
Notice, at any time after the occurrence of any such Event of Default and during
the continuance thereof,  institute an action for the recovery of the Fixed Rent
and/or  Additional  Rent in  respect  of which an Event of  Default  shall  have
occurred and be continuing.  Neither the commencement of any such action for the
recovery of Fixed Rent and/or Additional rent nor the prosecution  thereof shall
be deemed a waiver of Lessor's right to give a Termination  Notice in respect of
any such  Event of Default  during  the  continuance  thereof  and  Lessor  may,
notwithstanding  the  commencement  and  prosecution of any such action,  give a
Termination  Notice and terminate this Lease pursuant to Section  14.01.A at any
time during the continuance of such Event of Default.

     C. If, at any time,  (i) Lessee shall be comprised of two or more  persons,
or (ii) Lessee's  obligations under this Lease shall have been guaranteed by any
person other than Lessee,  or (iii)  Lessee's  interest in this Lease shall have
been assigned,  the word "Lessee",  as used in subdivisions  (4), (5) and (9) of
Section  14.01.A,  shall  be  deemed  to mean  any  one or  more of the  persons
primarily or secondarily  liable for Lessee's  obligations under this Lease. Any
monies received by Lessor from or on behalf of Lessee during the pendency of any
proceeding  of the types  referred to in said  subdivisions  (4), (5) and (9) of
Section 14.01.A shall be deemed paid as compensation  for the use and occupation
of the Demised  Premises and the acceptance of any such  compensation  by Lessor
shall not be deemed an  acceptance  of rent or a waiver on the part of Lessor of
any rights under Section 14.01.

     SECTION 14.02. In the event that this Lease shall be terminated as provided
in this  Article,  Lessor or Lessor's  agents may,  immediately,  or at any time
thereafter, without further notice, enter upon and re-enter the Demised Premises
and possess and repossess itself thereof, by summary  proceedings,  ejectment or
otherwise,  and  have,  hold and  enjoy the  Demised  Premises  and the right to
receive all income of and from the same. No re-entry by Lessor  pursuant to this
Article  shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease nor shall it
absolve or discharge Lessee from any liability under this Lease.

     SECTION 14.03. In the event that this Lease shall be terminated as provided
in this Article, Lessor may, at any time or from time to time thereafter,  relet
the Demised  Premises or any part thereof,  for such term or terms (which may be
greater or less than the period  which  would  otherwise  have  constituted  the
balance of the Term) and on such  conditions  (which may include  concessions or
free rent,  which  shall,  however,  be  amortized  over the entire term for the
purpose of determining damages under Article 15) as Lessor may determine, to any
tenant which it may deem suitable and  satisfactory  and for any use and purpose
it may deem  appropriate and may collect and receive the rents therefor.  Lessor
shall use commercially  reasonable methods in making such reletting.  Lessor, at
its  option,  may  make  such  repairs,  alterations,  additions,  improvements,
decorations and other physical  changes in and to the Demised Premises as Lessor
considers  advisable  or  necessary  in  connection  with any such  reletting or
proposed  reletting,  without relieving Lessee of any liability under this Lease
or otherwise affecting any such liability. Lessor shall in no way be responsible
or liable for any failure to relet the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, or
for any  failure  to  collect  any rent  due  upon  such  reletting.  Except  as
aforesaid,  Lessor  shall not in any event be  required to pay Lessee (but shall
credit Lessee, to the extent set forth in Article 15, with) any sums received by
Lessor on a reletting of the Demised Premises,  or any part thereof,  whether or
not in excess of the rent reserved in this Lease.

     SECTION  14.04.  Lessee,  on its own  behalf  and on behalf of all  persons
claiming through or under Lessee including all creditors,  does hereby waive any
and all rights and  privileges,  so far as is permitted by law, which Lessee and
all such persons  might  otherwise  have under any present or future law, to (i)
the  service  of  any  notice  of  intention  to  re-enter  or  institute  legal
proceedings to that end,  excluding service of process,  (ii) redeem the Demised
Premises,  (iii) re-enter or repossess the Demised Premises, or (iv) restore the
operation of this Lease, after Lessee shall have been dispossessed by a judgment
or by warrant of any court or judge,  or after any  re-entry  by Lessor or after
any  expiration  or  termination  of this  Lease  and  the  Term,  whether  such
dispossess,  re-entry, expiration or termination shall be by operation of law or
pursuant to the provisions of this Lease. The words  "re-enter,"  "re-entry" and
"re-entered" as used in this Lease shall not be deemed to be restricted to their
technical legal meanings.

     SECTION  14.05.  In the event the Lessee  shall  dispute  the  validity  or
amount,  or the time or manner of payment  of, any rent  claimed by Lessor to be
due from Lessee  under this Lease,  Lessee shall  nevertheless  pay the same and
such payment may be without prejudice to Lessee's position if Lessee so requests
at the time of payment.  If the dispute shall be finally  determined in Lessee's
favor by a court of  competent  jurisdiction,  Lessor  shall within a reasonable
period of time not to exceed  sixty (60) days pay Lessee the amount of  Lessee's
overpayment of such rent. Lessee's failure to observe and perform the provisions
of this  Section  shall be deemed a default  under  subdivision  (1) of  Section
14.01.A.

               ARTICLE 15 - MEASURE OF DAMAGES IN EVENT OF DEFAULT

     SECTION  15.01.  A. In the event that this Lease be terminated  pursuant to
Article  14 as a result of an Event of  Default  on the part of the  Lessee  and
whether or not the Demised Premises be relet, Lessor shall be entitled to retain
all  monies,  if any,  paid by Lessee to  Lessor,  whether  as  advance  rent or
otherwise,  but such monies shall be credited by Lessor  against any rent due at
the time of such termination, or at Lessor's option, against any damages payable
by Lessee, and Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee, and Lessee shall
pay to Lessor the following:

     (a) All rent to the date upon  which  this  Lease and the Term  shall  have
terminated, and

     (b) All expenses reasonably incurred by Lessor in recovering  possession of
the Demised  Premises  (including  summary  proceedings),  restoring the Demised
Premises to good order and condition,  maintaining the Demised  Premises in good
order and condition while vacant,  altering or otherwise  preparing the same for
reletting,   and  in  reletting  the  Demised  Premises   (including   brokerage
commissions  and  legal  expenses),  the same to be paid by  Lessee to Lessor on
demand, and

     (c) The amount by which the rent  which,  but for the  termination  of this
Lease,  would have been payable under this Lease from the date of termination to
the Expiration  Date exceeds the rental and other income,  if any,  collected by
Lessor  in  respect  of the  Demised  Premises,  or any  part  thereof,  subject
nevertheless  to the  provisions  of Section  14.03,  said  amount to be due and
payable by Lessee to Lessor on the  several  days on which the rent  reserved in
this Lease  would have become due and  payable  for the period  which  otherwise
would have  constituted the unexpired  portion of the Term (that is to say, upon
each of such days  Lessee  shall pay to Lessor  the  amount of  deficiency  then
existing).

     B.  Whether or not Lessor  shall have  collected  any monthly  deficiencies
aforesaid, Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee on demand, as and for
liquidated  damages,  a lump sum payment  equal to the amount by which the Fixed
Rent and Additional Rent payable  hereunder for the period which otherwise would
have  constituted the unexpired  portion of the Term (due account being taken of
amounts, if any, collected under clause [c] of Section 15.01.A, and conclusively
presuming  the  Additional  Rent to be the  same  as was  payable  for the  year
immediately  preceding  such  termination  or re-entry)  exceeds the then rental
value of the Demised  Premises  for the same period  both  discounted  at a rate
equal to then applicable Treasury Rate to present value. If the Demised Premises
or any part thereof be relet by Lessor for the unexpired portion of the Term, or
any part thereof, before presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to any
court,  commission or tribunal,  the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting
shall be deemed prima facie to be the fair and  reasonable  rental value for the
part or the  whole  of the  Demised  Premises  so relet  during  the term of the
reletting.  Nothing herein  contained  shall limit or prejudice the right of the
Lessor  to prove for and  obtain as  damages  by reason of such  termination  an
amount  equal to the maximum  allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at
the time when, and governing the  proceedings  in which,  such damages are to be
proved,  whether  or not such  amount  be  greater  or less  than the  amount of
liquidated damages referred to above (due account to be taken,  however,  of the
amounts, if any, collected under this Article 15).

     SECTION  15.02.  In no event shall Lessee be entitled to receive any excess
of the rental and other  income  collected  by Lessor in respect of the  Demised
Premises over the sums payable by Lessee to Lessor hereunder.  In no event shall
Lessee be entitled in any suit for the  collection  of damages  pursuant to this
Article to a credit in respect of any such  rental and other  income,  except to
the extent that such rental and other  income is allocable to the portion of the
Term in respect of which such suit is brought and is actually received by Lessor
prior to the entry of judgment in such suit.

     SECTION 15.03.  Separate actions may be maintained by Lessor against Lessee
from time to time to recover any damages which, at the  commencement of any such
action,  have then or theretofore become due and payable to Lessor under Article
14, without waiting until the end of the Term and without  prejudice to Lessor's
right to collect damages thereafter.

                          ARTICLE 16 - INDEMNIFICATION

     SECTION 16.01.  Notwithstanding  that joint or concurrent  liability may be
imposed  upon either party by statute,  ordinance,  rule,  regulation,  order or
court  decision,  and  notwithstanding  any insurance  furnished by either party
pursuant  hereto or otherwise,  Lessee shall and does hereby  indemnify and hold
Lessor and its agents,  officers,  directors,  and employees,  harmless from and
against any and all loss, liability, fines, suits, claims, obligations, damages,
penalties, demands and actions, and costs and reasonable expenses of any kind or
nature (including architects', engineers' and attorneys' fees) due to or arising
out of any of the following:

     (a) any work or thing done in, on or about the Demised  Premises,  Building
or the  Property  or  any  part  thereof  or any  use,  possession,  occupation,
condition, operation, maintenance, repair or management of the Demised Premises,
Building  or the  Property  or any part  thereof,  by Lessee or anyone  claiming
through  or  under  Lessee  or  the  respective  employees,  agents,  licensees,
contractors, servants or sublessees of Lessee or any such person;

     (b) any act or  omission  on the  part of  Lessee  or any  person  claiming
through  or  under  Lessee,  or the  respective  employees,  agents,  licensees,
invitees, contractors, servants or sublessees of Lessee or any such person; or

     (c) any  accident  or injury to any person  (including  death) or damage to
property  (including  loss of property)  occurring  in, on, or about the Demised
Premises,  Building  or the  Property  or any  part  thereof,  due to the act or
omission by Lessee, its employees, agents, licensees,  invitees,  contractors or
servants.

     The  provisions  of this  Section  16.01 shall  survive the  expiration  or
termination  of this  Lease.  Any sums  payable  by Lessee to Lessor  under this
Section 16.01 shall be due and payable on demand.

     SECTION  16.02.  Lessor  and  Lessor's  agents,  officers,  directors,  and
employees shall not be liable for any of the following,  however  caused,  other
than by its negligent or wilful acts:  (a) failure of any Utility  Service,  (b)
damage to Lessee's  property on the Demised Premises caused by or resulting from
any cause  whatsoever,  including  explosion,  falling plaster,  vermin,  smoke,
gasoline,  oil,  Hazardous  Materials,   steam,  gas  electricity,   earthquake,
subsidence  of land,  hurricane,  tornado,  flood,  wind or  similar  storms  or
disturbances  or water,  rain,  ice or snow  which may be upon,  or leak or flow
from, any street, road, parking lot, sewer, gas main or subsurface area, or from
any part of the Property,  or leakage of gasoline,  oil or other substances from
pipes, pipelines,  appliances,  storage tanks, sewers or plumbing works in or at
the Property,  or from any other place,  or from the breaking of any  electrical
wire or the breaking,  bursting or leaking of water or Hazardous  Materials from
any plumbing or  sprinkler  system,  or any other pipe or storage  tanks in, on,
under or about the Property,  (c) interference  with light or other  incorporeal
hereditaments,  and (d) loss by theft or otherwise  of Lessee's  Property or the
property of any person claiming through or under Lessee. Any employees of Lessor
to whom any  property  shall be  entrusted  by or on behalf  of Lessee  shall be
deemed to be acting as Lessee's agents with respect to such property and neither
Lessor  nor  Lessor's  agents  shall be liable for any loss or for damage to any
such property by theft or  otherwise.  This Section 16.02 shall not be construed
as a provision for indemnification.

     SECTION 16.03. Except as otherwise provided for in this Lease, Lessor shall
and does hereby  indemnify and hold harmless Lessee and Lessee's agents from and
against any and all loss, liability, fines, suits, claims, obligations, damages,
penalties, demands and actions, and costs and reasonable expenses of any kind or
nature (including  architects' and attorneys' fees) due to or arising out of the
negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor, its agents, officers,  directors and
employees.  In case of any obligation of Lessor to indemnify  Lessee pursuant to
this Section,  such obligation  shall be subject to and conditioned upon (x) the
receipt by Lessor of prompt  written  notice of the claim with  respect to which
indemnification is sought and (y) Lessor's having had reasonable  opportunity to
conduct the defense of such claim in such manner as it deems  appropriate,  with
the full  cooperation  of Lessee,  and using  counsel  reasonably  acceptable to
Lessor

                     ARTICLE 17 - MECHANIC'S AND OTHER LIENS

     SECTION 17.01. If any mechanic's,  laborer's or materialman's lien shall be
at any time be filed against the Demised Premises,  Building or Property, or any
part thereof with  respect to any work done,  or caused to be done,  or labor or
materials  furnished,  or caused to be furnished,  by Lessee or anyone  claiming
through or under Lessee,  Lessee, within thirty (30) days after notice to Lessee
of the  filing  thereof,  shall  cause  the same to be  discharged  of record by
payment, deposit, bond, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise.
If Lessee  shall  fail to cause  such lien to be  discharged  within  the period
aforesaid, then, in addition to any other right or remedy, Lessor may, but shall
not be obligated to, discharge the same by bonding proceedings,  if permitted by
law (and if not so  permitted,  by  deposit  in  court).  Any  amount so paid by
Lessor, including all costs and expenses paid by Lessor in connection therewith,
together  with interest  thereon at the maximum  legal rate from the  respective
dates of Lessor's so paying any such amount,  cost or expense,  shall constitute
Additional  Rent  payable by Lessee under this Lease and shall be paid by Lessee
to Lessor on demand.

                            ARTICLE 18 - CONDEMNATION

     SECTION 18.01. If the whole of the Demised  Premises,  or such part thereof
as will render the  remainder  Untenantable,  shall be acquired or condemned for
any public or quasi-public use or purpose,  this Lease and the Term shall end as
of the date of vesting of title in the condemning authority with the same effect
as if said date were the Expiration Date. If only a part of the Demised Premises
shall be so acquired or condemned  then,  except as  otherwise  provided in this
Article,  this Lease and the Term shall  continue in force and effect but,  from
and after the date of the  vesting of title,  the Rent shall be an amount  which
bears the same ratio to the Rent payable  immediately prior to such condemnation
pursuant  to this  Lease as the  value of the  untaken  portion  of the  Demised
Premises  (appraised  after  taking  and  repair of any  damage  to the  Demised
Premises  pursuant  to this  Section)  bears to the value of the entire  Demised
Premises immediately before the taking. The value of the Demised Premises before
and after the taking shall be determined  for the purposes of this Section by an
independent  licensed  appraiser  chosen by  Lessor.  If more than  sixty  (60%)
percent of the total  area of the  Building  included  in the  Demised  Premises
immediately prior to acquisition or condemnation is so acquired or condemned, or
if by  reason  of  such  acquisition  or  condemnation,  Lessee  no  longer  has
reasonable  means of access to the Demised  Premises,  or more than thirty (30%)
percent  of the  Demised  Premises  occupied  by  Lessee  herein  named  and any
affiliated or related assignee or subtenant of Lessee herein named (exclusive of
any portion of the Demised Premises subleased to all other tenants or occupants)
is so acquired or  condemned,  or more than  thirty  (30%)  percent of the total
parking on the Property is so acquired or condemned  and such parking  cannot be
replaced by Lessor  with  alternative  parking  within  walking  distance to the
Building at no charge to Lessee,  then in such events,  either  party,  may give
notice to the other party  within sixty (60) days next  following  the date upon
which Lessee have received  notice of vesting of title,  thirty (30) days notice
of termination  of this Lease.  Lessor will give Lessee notice of such taking or
condemnation  as soon as  reasonably  practicable.  In the event any such thirty
(30) day notice of termination is given by Lessor or Lessee,  this Lease and the
Term shall  terminate upon the expiration of said thirty (30) days with the same
effect  as if that  date  were the  Expiration  Date.  If a part of the  Demised
Premises shall be so acquired or condemned, and the Term shall not be terminated
pursuant to the provisions of this Section,  Lessor, at Lessor's expense,  shall
restore  that part of the Demised  Premises  not so acquired or  condemned  to a
self-contained  unit. In the event of any termination of this Lease and the Term
pursuant to the provisions of this Section,  the Rent shall be apportioned as of
the date of  sooner  termination  and any  prepaid  portion  of the Rent for any
period  after such date shall be  refunded  by Lessor to Lessee,  subject to the
claims, if any, of Lessor against Lessee hereunder or otherwise.

     SECTION 18.02.  In the event of any  acquisition or  condemnation of all or
part of the  Demised  Premises  for any public or  quasi-public  use or purpose,
except as  hereinafter  provided  Lessor shall be entitled to receive the entire
award for such acquisition or condemnation, other than the unamortized leasehold
improvements  paid by Lessee and not reimbursed by Lessor,  Lessee shall have no
claim against Lessor or the condemning  authority for the value of any unexpired
portion of the Term and  Lessee  hereby  expressly  assigns to Lessor all of its
right,  title and interest in and to any such award,  and also agrees to execute
any and all further  documents  that may be required in order to facilitate  the
collection thereof by Lessor.  Nothing contained in this Section shall be deemed
to prevent  Lessee from making a separate claim in any  condemnation  proceeding
for moving  expenses and for the value of any Lessee's  Property  which would be
removable at the end of the Term  pursuant to the  provisions  hereof,  directly
against any governmental  authority  authorized to exercise the power of eminent
domain,  provided that  applicable  statutes permit such awards and any award to
Lessor is not diminished or adversely affected thereby.

     SECTION 18.03. The terms  "condemnation"  and "acquisition" as used in this
Article  shall  include  any  agreement  in  lieu of or in  anticipation  of the
exercise  of the power of eminent  domain  between  Lessor  and/or any  Superior
Mortgage  and any  governmental  authority  authorized  to exercise the power of
eminent domain.

                    ARTICLE 19 - COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

     SECTION  19.01.  If and so long as no Event of Default  shall have occurred
and be  continuing,  Lessor  covenants  and agrees that Lessee may peaceably and
quietly  enjoy the  Demised  Premises  and  Lessee's  possession  of the Demised
Premises will not be disturbed by Lessor,  its successors and assigns,  subject,
however, to the terms of this Lease (including those set forth in Sections 24.01
and 24.02), the Mortgage, Superior Lease and any and/or all other agreements and
any amendments thereto, to which this Lease is subordinated.

               ARTICLE 20 - WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM AND JURY TRIAL

     SECTION 20.01. In the event that Lessor shall commence any summary or other
proceedings  or action  for  non-payment  of rent  hereunder,  Lessee  shall not
interpose any  counterclaim  of any nature or description in such  proceeding or
action, unless such non-interposition would effect a waiver of Lessee's right to
assert such claim against Lessor in a separate action or proceeding. The parties
hereto  waive a trial by jury on any and all  issues  arising  in any  action or
proceeding  between them or their  successors under or in any way connected with
this Lease or any of its provisions,  any negotiations in connection  therewith,
the  relationship  of Lessor and Lessee,  or Lessee's use or  occupation  of the
Demised  Premises,  including  any  claim of injury  or any  emergency  or other
statutory  remedy with respect  thereto.  The  provisions  of this Article shall
survive the expiration or other termination of this Lease.

                              ARTICLE 21 - NOTICES

     SECTION 21.01. A. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, any
bills, statements,  notices, demands, requests, consents or other communications
given or  required  to be given  under this  Lease  shall be  effective  only if
rendered or given in writing and

     (a) If to Lessee,  then, at the option of Lessor, (i) addressed to Lessee's
address  as set forth in this  Lease,  or to such  other  address  as Lessee may
designate  as its new  address  for such  purpose  by notice  given to Lessor in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, or (ii) delivered  personally to
Lessee, or (iii) by overnight courier,

     (b) If to Lessor, sent by personal delivery or overnight courier, addressed
to Lessor at Lessor's address as set forth in this Lease, with copies thereof to
Steven C. Hirsch,  Esq., 585 Stewart  Avenue,  Suite 430,  Garden City, New York
11530,  or to such other  address as Lessor may designate as its new address for
such purpose by notice given to Lessee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section.

     B. Any such bill,  statement,  notice,  demand,  request,  consent or other
communication  shall be deemed to have been  rendered or given:  (i) on the date
delivered,  if delivered to Lessee personally,  or by overnight courier and (ii)
on the expiration of five (5) days after mailing,  if mailed to Lessor or Lessee
as provided in this  Section.  Any notice by a party  signed by counsel for such
party shall be deemed a notice signed by such party.

              ARTICLE 22 - WAIVERS AND SURRENDERS TO BE IN WRITING

     SECTION 22.01. The receipt of full or partial rent by Lessor with knowledge
of any  breach  of this  Lease by Lessee  or of any  default  on the part of the
Lessee in the observance or performance of any of the provisions or covenants of
this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any such provision, covenant or
breach of this Lease  provided,  however,  that  acceptance of a payment of rent
shall be valid pro  tanto.  No  waiver  or  modification  by  Lessor,  unless in
writing,  and signed by Lessor,  shall  discharge or invalidate any provision or
covenant  or affect the right of Lessor to enforce  the same in the event of any
subsequent breach or default. The failure on the part of Lessor to insist in any
one or more  instances  upon the strict  performance of any of the provisions or
covenants  of this  Lease,  or to  enforce  any  covenant  or  provision  herein
contained  or to  exercise  any  right,  remedy  or  election  herein  contained
consequent  upon a breach of any  provision  of this Lease,  shall not affect or
alter this Lease or be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of
such one or more  provisions  or covenants or of the right to insist upon strict
performance  or to exercise such right,  remedy or election,  but the same shall
continue  and remain in full force and effect  with  respect to any  existing or
subsequent  breach,  act or omission,  whether of a similar nature or otherwise.
The  receipt  by  Lessor  of any rent or any  other  sum of  money or any  other
consideration hereunder paid by Lessee after the termination,  in any manner, of
the Term,  or after the giving by Lessor of the  Termination  Notice,  shall not
reinstate,  continue or extend the Term, or destroy, or in any manner impair the
efficacy of any such  Termination  Notice,  as may have been given  hereunder by
Lessor to Lessee prior to the receipt of any such rent, or other sum of money or
other  consideration,  unless so  agreed to in  writing  and  signed by  Lessor.
Neither  acceptance  of the keys or any other act or thing done by Lessor or any
agent or employee  shall be deemed to be an  acceptance  of a  surrender  of the
Demised  Premises,  or any part thereof,  excepting only an agreement in writing
signed by Lessor.  No payment by Lessee or receipt by Lessor of a lesser  amount
than the correct rent shall be deemed to be other than a payment on account, nor
shall any  endorsement  or statement  on any check,  as  distinguished  from any
letter  accompanying  such check or payment,  be deemed to effect or evidence an
accord and  satisfaction,  and Lessor may accept  such check or payment  without
prejudice to Lessor's right to recover the balance or pursue any other remedy in
this Lease provided.

                          ARTICLE 23- RIGHTS CUMULATIVE

     SECTION  23.01.  Each right and remedy of Lessor shall be cumulative and to
the extent permitted by law, the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Lessor
of any one or more of the rights or remedies  of such party  shall not  preclude
the  simultaneous  or later  exercise  by Lessor  of any or all other  rights or
remedies;  provided,  however,  that this  sentence  shall not be  construed  to
entitle  Lessor  to  satisfaction  of more  than  one  remedy  in  respect  of a
particular  breach. In the event of any breach or threatened breach by Lessee or
any persons  claiming  through or under Lessee of any of the agreements,  terms,
covenants or  conditions  contained  in this Lease,  Lessor shall be entitled to
enjoin  such  breach or  threatened  breach (if  entitled  to do so at law or in
equity or by statue or  otherwise)  and shall have the right to invoke any right
or remedy allowed by law or in equity or by statute or otherwise as if re-entry,
summary  proceedings  or other  specific  remedies were not provided for in this
Lease.

                  ARTICLE 24- CONVEYANCE; LIABILITY OF PARTIES

     SECTION 24.01. The term "Lessor" as used herein shall mean and include only
the owner or owners at the time in  question  of the  Lessor's  interest in this
Lease so that in the event of any transfer or transfers  (by operation of law or
otherwise) of Lessor's entire  interest in this Lease,  Lessor herein named (and
in the case of any subsequent  transfers or  conveyances,  the then  transferor)
shall be and hereby is automatically freed and relieved, from and after the date
of such transfer or conveyance,  of all liability in respect of the  performance
of any  covenants  or  obligations  on the part of the Lessor  contained in this
Lease  thereafter to be performed,  provided that the transferee shall be deemed
to have assumed and agreed to perform  subject to the limitation of this Article
(and without further  agreement between or among the parties or their successors
in  interest,  and/or  the  transferee)  and only  during  and in respect of the
transferee's period of ownership,  all of the terms, covenants and conditions in
this  Lease  contained  on the part of  Lessor  to be  performed,  which  terms,
covenants,  and  conditions  shall be deemed to "run  with the  land",  it being
intended hereby that the terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Lease
on the part of the  Lessor to be  performed  shall,  subject  as  aforesaid,  be
binding on Lessor,  its  successors  and assigns,  only during and in respect of
their respective successive periods of ownership.

     SECTION  24.02.  In the  event of a breach  by  Lessor  of any  provisions,
covenants or obligations  of this Lease to be performed by Lessor,  the monetary
liability  of Lessor in  relation  to any such  breach  shall be  limited to the
equity of Lessor in the Property and the rents and issues therefrom,  and Lessee
shall  look only to  Lessor's  equity in the  Property  and the rents and issues
therefrom for the performance and observance of the terms, covenants, conditions
and  obligations of this Lease to be performed or observed by Lessor and for the
satisfaction of Lessee's  remedies for the collection of any award,  judgment or
other judicial process  requiring the payment of money by Lessor in the event of
a  default  in the full and  prompt  payment  and  performance  of any  Lessor's
obligations  hereunder  and in no event shall any of the  partners  constituting
Lessor (the "Partners"), nor the partners,  shareholders,  officers or directors
of Lessor  or the  Partners  shall be liable  for the  performance  of  Lessor's
obligations  under this Lease, nor shall any of the Partners assets be liable to
any levy, execution,  restraint, award, claim of any kind whatsoever arising out
of, or in any way related to this Lease.

     SECTION  24.03.  The term  "Lessee"  as used in this  Lease  shall mean and
include  Lessee  named  herein  and,  during and in respect of their  respective
successive  periods  of  ownership,  each  subsequent  owner  or  owners  of the
leasehold  estate  created by this  Lease.  For all  purposes  of this Lease and
without  affecting the rights of, and obligations  between,  Lessee herein named
and  any  transferee,  notwithstanding  any  transfer  (by  operation  or law or
otherwise)  of title to the  leasehold  estate  created  by this Lease by Lessee
herein named or by any subsequent owner of such estate and  notwithstanding  the
assumption by any transferee of the obligations of the Lessee hereunder,  Lessee
herein named, as between Lessor and Lessee herein named,  shall remain primarily
liable as primary  obligor and not as a surety,  for the full and prompt payment
and  performance of Lessee's  obligations  hereunder and,  without  limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing  or of Article 28, shall remain fully and directly
responsible  and liable to Lessor for all acts and  omissions on the part of any
transferee subsequent to it in violation of any obligation of this Lease.

                  ARTICLE 25- CHANGES AND ALTERATIONS BY LESSEE

     SECTION 25.01.A. Lessee shall have no right to make any alteration, change,
additions or improvement,  structural or otherwise,  to the Demised  Premises or
any  appurtenances  thereto  which  affect the  Building  Equipment or require a
permit  and/or  appropriate  certificates  from the  Governmental  Authority (an
"Alteration")  without  the prior  written  consent of Lessor in each  instance,
which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or delayed. With
respect  to any  alterations,  changes,  additions,  or  improvements  which are
considered cosmetic and not constituting an Alteration, no consent of the Lessor
shall be required, provided, however, that Lessee shall notify Lessor of same at
least five (5) days prior to performing such an Alteration.

     B. If Lessor shall grant its consent to the making of an  Alteration,  then
the same shall (i) be performed at the sole cost and expense of Lessee,  (ii) be
performed  in a  good  and  workmanlike  manner,  and  in  compliance  with  all
applicable  Legal  Requirements   (including   existing  zoning   requirements),
Insurance  Requirements and Environmental Laws, (iii) be consistent with the use
of the Demised  Premises  provided  for  herein,  (iv) not in any way render the
Demised Premises other than a complete,  self containing  operating unit, (v) in
the case of a structural  alteration,  be performed in accordance with plans and
specifications approved prior to the commencement of any work by the appropriate
Governmental  Authorities  and by  Lessor,  (vi) be of such  nature so as not to
lessen the fair market  value of the Demised  Premises,  and (vii) be  performed
under  the  supervision  of a  licensed  architect  approved  by  Lessor  and in
accordance with Lessor's  Standard  Requirements For Alterations To Be Performed
By Lessees', as may be amended from time to time, as EXHIBIT "G."

     SECTION  25.02.A.  Any and all Alterations  made in accordance with Section
25.01 shall immediately become the property of Lessor,  provided,  however, that
if, in  accordance  with the  provisions of Sections  25.02.B and 29.02,  Lessee
shall have the option to and shall remove its trade fixtures, provided that same
are not affixed to or such removal would otherwise materially damage the Demised
Premises,  then the same shall cease to be property of the Lessor upon  removal,
provided Lessee repairs any such damage.

     B. Unless Lessor shall otherwise  expressly indicate in writing at the time
of granting its consent to the making of a proposed Alteration, Lessee shall, as
and when provided in Section 29.02,  restore the affected portion of the Demised
Premises to the state or condition  thereof existing prior to the making of such
Alteration.

     C. Any and all  contractors  to be  involved  in  performing  work shall be
subject to Lessor's prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     D. Prior to  commencing  any work at the  Demised  Premises,  Lessee  shall
furnish Lessor with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lessor of such insurance
as Lessor  may  require  and such  insurance  shall be in full  force and effect
during such work and will cover,  by endorsement  or otherwise,  the risk during
the course of such work.

     E. In the event of any Alteration as provided for in this Article, the Rent
payable hereunder shall not be reduced or abated in any manner whatsoever.

     F. No Alterations  shall involve the removal of any fixtures,  equipment or
other property in the Demised Premises which are not Lessee's  property,  unless
Lessor's  prior  written  consent is first  obtained  and unless such  fixtures,
equipment or other property shall be promptly replaced,  at Lessee's expense and
free of superior  title,  liens and claims,  with  fixtures,  equipment or other
property  (as the case may be) of like  utility and at least equal value  (which
replaced  fixtures,  equipment  or other  property  shall  thereupon  become the
property of Lessor), unless Lessor shall otherwise expressly consent in writing.

         SECTION 25.03. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Lessor
shall have the option of performing any and all Alterations pursuant to Article
25 of this Lease on Lessee's behalf and at Lessee's Cost.

                 ARTICLE 26 - CERTIFICATES OF LESSEE AND LESSOR

     SECTION  26.01.  Lessee  agrees at any time and from  time to time,  within
twenty (20) days after request by Lessor, to execute,  acknowledge and deliver a
statement  certifying (i) the Commencement Date hereunder,  (ii) that this Lease
is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications,
that  the  Lease is in full  force  and  effect  as  modified  and  stating  the
modifications), (iii) the dates to which the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent have
been  paid,  and (iv)  whether  or not to the  knowledge  of the  signer of such
statement (a) Lessor is in default in keeping, observing or performing any term,
covenant, agreement,  provision, condition or limitation contained in this Lease
and, if in default,  specifying  each such default,  (b) either party is holding
any funds  under  this  Lease in which the other has an  interest  (and,  if so,
specifying the party holding such funds and the nature and amount thereof),  and
(c) there is any  amount  then due and  payable  to Lessee by  Lessor,  it being
intended  that any such  statement  delivered  pursuant  to this  Section may be
relied upon by Lessor, any mortgagee,  superior lessor or any person who may and
does become a mortgagee,  superior lessee,  any person who may and does become a
purchaser  or  assignee of  Lessor's  interest in this Lease or the  mortgagee's
interest in any mortgage or the Lessor's interest in the Superior Lease.

     SECTION  26.02.  Lessor  agrees at any time and from  time to time,  within
twenty (20) days after request by Lessee, to execute,  acknowledge and deliver a
statement  certifying (i) the Commencement Date hereunder,  (ii) that this Lease
is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications,
that  the  Lease is in full  force  and  effect  as  modified  and  stating  the
modifications), (iii) the dates to which the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent have
been  paid,  and (iv)  whether  or not to the  knowledge  of the  signer of such
statement (a) Lessee is in default in keeping, observing or performing any term,
covenant, agreement,  provision, condition or limitation contained in this Lease
and, if in default,  specifying  each such default,  (b) either party is holding
any funds  under  this  Lease in which the other has an  interest  (and,  if so,
specifying the party holding such funds and the nature and amount thereof),  and
(c) there is any  amount  then due and  payable  to Lessor by  Lessee,  it being
intended  that any such  statement  delivered  pursuant  to this  Section may be
relied upon by Lessee.


                ARTICLE- 27 ASSIGNMENTS, SUBLEASES AND MORTGAGES

     SECTION 27.01.A. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article,
neither  this  Lease,  nor the  Term and  estate  hereby  granted,  nor any part
thereof,  nor the interest of Lessee in any  sublease or the rental  thereunder,
shall be assigned,  mortgaged,  pledged,  encumbered or otherwise transferred by
Lessee or Lessee's legal representatives or successors in interest, by operation
of law or otherwise, and neither the Demised Premises, nor any part thereof, nor
any Lessee's Property, shall be encumbered in any manner by reason of any act or
omission on the part of Lessee or anyone  claiming under or through  Lessee,  or
shall be sublet or be used or  occupied or  permitted  to be used or occupied or
utilized  for desk or  storage  space by  anyone  other  than  Lessee or for any
purpose other than as  specifically  permitted by this Lease,  without the prior
written consent of Lessor in each case,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

     B. If Lessee herein named is a corporation  or other entity,  upon at least
thirty  (30) days prior  notice to Lessor,  this  Lease in its  entirety  may be
assigned  without  Lessor's  consent to a corporation or other entity into which
Lessee  merges or  consolidates,  or which  controls,  is controlled by or under
common  control  with Lessee  immediately  prior to such  transaction,  or to an
entity which is purchasing,  regardless of the form of the  transaction,  all or
substantially  all of the assets or stock of Lessee  herein  named  (hereinafter
referred to collectively as the "Related Transactions"),  so long as the Demised
Premises  continue to be used for the use  described in Article 4 of this Lease;
the transfer is not principally  for the purpose of  transferring  the leasehold
estate created hereby; the assignee assumes by documents reasonably satisfactory
to Lessor all of Lessee's  obligations  to be performed  under this Lease,  and;
provided  such  assignment  shall  be  subject  to all of the  other  terms  and
conditions of this Lease.

     C.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Lessee shall have the right,  upon ten
(10)  days  notice  to  Lessor,  without  Lessor's  consent,  to:  (i)  sublease
individual offices and secretarial areas in the Demised Premises,  provided that
same do not  exceed in the  aggregate,  more than  Twenty  (20%)  percent of the
rentable square footage of the Demised  Premises,  and (ii) sublease portions of
the Demised Premises, and permit portions of the Demised Premises to be occupied
or utilized for desk space by,  affiliates,  subsidiaries  or a parent of Lessee
and/or their employees or consultants,  so long as the Demised Premises continue
to be used for the use  described in Article 4 of this Lease and  provided  such
sublease shall be subject to all of the other terms and conditions of this Lease
(hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Permitted Subleases").

     SECTION 27.02.A. Except for Related Transaction and Permitted Subleases, if
this Lease be assigned,  whether or not in violation of the  provisions  of this
Lease,  Lessor may collect rent from the assignee,  and Lessor shall be entitled
to receive, as Additional,  Rent, Twenty-Five (25%) percent of all of the excess
consideration paid to Lessee in connection with such assignment as shall for any
period  exceed the  aggregate of the Rents payable under this Lease (the "Excess
Consideration").  Such Excess  Consideration  shall be reduced by the reasonable
cost of tenant  improvements,  brokerage  commissions  and  attorneys'  fees and
disbursements  reasonably  incurred by Lessee for such  assignment,  and the net
amount  thereof  shall be paid to  Lessor  either:  (i) in a lump  sum,  (ii) or
allocated  to such  period  on a  straight  line  basis  over  the  term of such
assignment if paid in  installments,  as the case may be, promptly after receipt
thereof by Lessee.  The  provisions of the preceding  sentence  shall be in full
force and effect  notwithstanding  that Lessee has sought the  protection of any
provisions of the bankruptcy law (as  hereinafter  defined) or if a petition has
been filed against Lessee under such bankruptcy law. If the Demised  Premises or
any part thereof be sublet or be used or occupied by anybody  other than Lessee,
whether or not in violation of this Lease,  Lessor may,  after default by Lessee
and expiration of Lessee's time to cure such default,  if any, collect rent from
the  sublessee or  occupant.  In either  event,  Lessor may apply the net amount
collected  to the rents herein  reserved,  but no such  assignment,  subletting,
occupancy or  collection  shall be deemed a waiver of any of the  provisions  of
Section  27.01,  or the  acceptance  of the  assignee,  sublessee or occupant as
tenant,  or a  release  of  Lessee  from the  further  performance  by Lessee of
Lessee's  obligations  under this Lease. The consent by Lessor to an assignment,
mortgaging  or  subletting  pursuant to any provision of this Lease shall not in
any way be considered to relieve  Lessee from  obtaining the express  consent of
Lessor for any other or further assignment, mortgaging or subletting. References
in this  Lease to use or  occupancy  by anyone  other than  Lessee  shall not be
construed  as  limited  to  sublessees  and  those  claiming  under  or  through
sublessees  but as including  also licensees and other claiming under or through
Lessee,  immediately  or  remotely.  The  listing of any name other than that of
Lessee  on any  door of the  Demised  Premises  or on any  sign  on the  Demised
Premises,  or  otherwise,  shall not  operate to vest in the person so named any
right or  interest  in this Lease or in the  Demised  Premises,  or be deemed to
constitute,  or serve as a substitute  for, any prior consent of Lessor required
under this Article,  and it is understood that any such listing shall constitute
a privilege  extended by Lessor  which shall be  revocable  at Lessor's  will by
notice to Lessee.  Lessee  agrees to pay to Lessor any  reasonable  counsel fees
incurred  by Lessor in  connection  with any  proposed  assignment  of  Lessee's
interest in this Lease or any proposed subletting of the Demised Premises or any
part thereof.  Neither any assignment of Lessee's interest in this Lease nor any
subletting,  occupancy or use of the Demised Premises or any part thereof by any
person other than Lessee as provided in this Article, nor any application of any
such rent as provided in this Article shall,  under any  circumstances,  relieve
Lessee herein named of its  obligations  fully to observe and perform the terms,
covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease on Lessee's  part to be  observed  and
performed. B. Lessor, however, shall not in any event be obligated to consent to
the  assignment  of this  Lease,  in  those  cases  where  consent  is  required
hereunder,  unless:  (i) in the  reasonable  judgment  of  Lessor  the  proposed
assignee is of a character  and  financial  worth such as is in keeping with the
standards of Lessor in those respects for the Demised Premises,  or the assignee
can  otherwise  secure and  guaranty  the  payment to Lessor or all Rent and any
other  amounts  due from Lessee  pursuant  to this Lease in a manner  reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor;  (ii) the nature of the proposed assignee's business and
its reputation are in keeping with the character of the Demised Premises and the
use thereof,  (iii) the purpose for which the proposed  assignee  intends to use
the Demised  Premises  assigned to it are uses  expressly  permitted  by and not
expressly  prohibited by this Lease; (iv) the proposed assignment shall prohibit
any further  assignment  without Lessor's consent as provided for herein; (v) no
Event of Default  shall have occurred and be  continuing;  and (vi) Lessee shall
reimburse  Lessor for all  reasonable  costs that may be  incurred  by Lessor in
connection   with  the  said   assignment,   including   the   costs  of  making
investigations  as to the  acceptability of a proposed  assignee and legal costs
incurred in connection with the granting of any requested consent.

     SECTION 27.03. A. Except for Related  Transactions and Permitted Subleases,
notwithstanding  anything  contained in Sections  27.01 and 27.02,  in the event
that, at any time or from time to time during the Term, Lessee desires to sublet
all or any part of the Demised  Premises,  Lessee  shall  notify  Lessor of such
desire and shall:  (i) submit to Lessor in writing  the name and  address of the
proposed subtenant,  a reasonably detailed statement of the proposed subtenant's
business,  reasonably  detailed financial  references for the proposed subtenant
and any other  information  reasonably  requested by Lessor,  and (ii) submit to
Lessor a copy of the proposed sublease.

     B. If within five (5) business  days after Lessee shall have  requested the
consent of Lessor to any assignment or subletting under this Article,  and shall
have submitted all items required hereby, the term of the proposed assignment or
sublease  may  commence  upon  Lessor's  consent,   which  consent  may  not  be
unreasonably withheld, it being agreed that if within such five (5) business day
period Lessor does not advise Lessee that such consent is granted,  such consent
shall be deemed granted by Lessor.  Lessor,  however,  shall not in any event be
obligated to consent to the proposed  sublease or the  commencement  of the term
unless: (i) in the reasonable  judgment of Lessor the proposed subtenant is of a
character and financial worth such as is in keeping with the standards of Lessor
in those  respects  for the  Demised  Premises,  and the nature of the  proposed
subtenant's business and its reputation are in keeping with the character of the
Demised  Premises and the use  thereof,  (ii) the purpose for which the proposed
subtenant or assignee  intends to use the portion of the Demised Premises sublet
or assigned to it are uses expressly  permitted by and not expressly  prohibited
by this Lease;  (iii) the proposed  sublease  shall  prohibit any  assignment or
subletting   without  the  consent  of  Lessor,   which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or delayed;  (iv) no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing  and (v) Lessee shall  reimburse  Lessor for all
reasonable  costs that may be  incurred  by Lessor in  connection  with the said
sublease,  including the costs of making  investigations as to the acceptability
of a proposed subtenant and legal costs incurred in connection with the granting
of any requested consent.

     C. With respect to each and every  subletting  authorized by the provisions
of this Article it is further  agreed and  understood  between Lessor and Lessee
that:  (i) the  subletting  shall be,  and each such  sublease  shall  expressly
provide that is, subject and  subordinate  at all times and in all respects,  to
this Lease,  (ii) no  subletting  shall be for a term ending  later than one day
prior to the Expiration  Date  originally  provided for herein and that part, if
any, of the proposed  term of any sublease  which shall extend beyond a date one
day prior to the Expiration Date  originally  provided for herein (or any sooner
date of the  expiration  of the term or  termination  of this  Lease)  is hereby
deemed to be a nullity,  (iii) there shall be  delivered  to Lessor,  within ten
(10) days after the commencement of the term of the proposed sublease, notice of
such  commencement  and a fully executed copy of the proposed  sublease  (unless
previously  submitted) and (iv) Lessee shall pay to Lessor,  as Additional Rent,
Twenty-Five (25%) percent of all of the Excess  Consideration  allocated to such
period on a straight line basis over the term of such subletting.

     D. Anything herein  contained to the contrary  notwithstanding:  (i) Lessee
shall not advertise but may list its space for subletting or assignment, and may
list its space at a rental  rate lower  than the rental  rate then being paid by
Lessee to Lessor only with respect to subletting  (but not  assignment) and (ii)
no assignment or subletting shall be made to any person or entity which shall at
that time otherwise be a tenant, sub-tenant or other occupant of any part of the
Property or which shall  within the prior Five (5) months have been  negotiating
with Lessor to become such a tenant, sub-tenant or occupant of the Property.

                           ARTICLE 28 - SUBORDINATION

     SECTION 28.01.A.  Subject to Section 28.01.C, this Lease, and all rights of
Lessee  hereunder,  are and shall be subject and  subordinate in all respects to
(a) the IDA Lease (as  hereinafter  defined)  and all present and future  ground
leases,  overriding  leases and  underlying  leases and/or grants of term of the
Property,  the Building,  the Building Equipment and/or any appurtenance thereto
of which Lessor has notified Lessee  (collectively,  the "Superior Lease"),  (b)
all mortgages and building loan agreements, including leasehold mortgages, deeds
of trust,  and building loan  agreements,  which may now or hereafter affect the
Property,  the Building, the Building Equipment and/or any appurtenance thereto,
of which Lessor has notified Lessee (collectively,  the "Mortgage"),  whether or
not the Mortgage shall also cover other land and/or buildings,  and (c) each and
every  advance  made or  hereafter  to be made  under  the  Mortgage  and to all
renewals,  modifications,  replacements,  substitutions  and  extensions  of any
Superior  Lease  and  the  Mortgage  and  spreaders  and  consolidations  of the
Mortgage.  The provisions of this Section shall be self-operative and no further
instrument  of  subordination  shall  be  required.   In  confirmation  of  such
subordination,  Lessee shall promptly  execute and deliver,  at its own cost and
expense, an instrument in recordable form to evidence such subordination. If, in
connection with the obtaining, continuing or renewing of financing for which the
Demised  Premises  or the  interest  of the  lessee  under  the  Superior  Lease
represents  collateral in whole or in part, a bank,  insurance  company or other
lender shall request  reasonable  modifications  of this Lease as a condition of
such  financing,  Lessee  will not  unreasonably  withhold  or delay its consent
thereto,   provided  that  such  modifications  do  not  increase  the  monetary
obligations  of  Lessee  under  this  Lease or  materially  increase  the  other
obligations of Lessee hereunder or materially and adversely affect the rights of
Lessee under this Lease.

     B.  Upon  execution  of this  Lease,  Lessor  shall  deliver  to  Lessee  a
Subordination and Non-Disturbance  Agreement from The Union Labor Life Insurance
Company,  Lessor's  current  mortgagee,  and The Westchester  County  Industrial
Development Agency in the forms annexed hereto collectively as EXHIBIT "I."

     C. In addition to the provisions of Section  28.01.B of this Lease,  during
the Term of this Lease,  Lessor agrees to provide  Lessee with an agreement from
the holder of the  Mortgage or the lessor  under the IDA Lease and/or a Superior
Lease, providing in substance,  that if and so long as no Event of Default shall
be  continuing,  this Lease shall  continue  upon its then  executory  terms and
conditions  and  possession  of the  Demised  Premises  held by Lessee,  and any
permitted  sublessee  or  assignee,  will not be disturbed by such person in the
event of a default under the Mortgage, IDA Lease, or Superior Lease, as the case
may be (the "NDA"). The form of the NDA shall be the holder of the Mortgage, IDA
Lease  or  Superior  Lease,  as the  case  may  be,  current  standard  form  of
non-disturbance  agreement,  provided,  however, that such NDA will not increase
the  monetary  obligations  of Lessee  under  this Lease or  increase  the other
obligations  of Lessee  hereunder  more than to a de minimus extent or adversely
affect the rights of Lessee  under  this  Lease or reduce  Lessor's  obligations
hereunder.

     SECTION  28.02.  If at any time prior to the  expiration  of the Term,  the
holder of the  Mortgage  shall  become the owner of the  Demised  Premises  as a
result of  foreclosure  of its  mortgage  or by reason of an  assignment  of the
lessee's  interest  under any such lease or conveyance of the Demised  Premises,
Lessee  agrees,  at the  election  and upon  demand of any owner of the  Demised
Premises,  or of the holder of any  Mortgage  or  Superior  Lease  (including  a
leasehold mortgage) in possession of the Demised Premises,  to attorn, from time
to time,  to any such  owner,  or  lessee,  upon the then  executory  terms  and
conditions  of this Lease,  provided that such owner,  holder or lessee,  as the
case may be, shall then be entitled to  possession of the Demised  Premises.  No
such owner,  holder or lessee shall be liable for any previous  acts or omission
of Lessor under this Lease (except that this provision shall not be construed to
relieve such person from any obligation  thereafter to be performed),  nor shall
such  owner  holder  or  Lessee  be  subject  to any  offset  which  shall  have
theretofore  accrued  to  Lessee  against  Lessor,  or be bound by any  previous
modification of this Lease,  not expressly  provided for in this Lease,  entered
into after the date of the  Mortgage,  or  Superior  Lease,  or by any  previous
prepayment of more than one month's Fixed Rent. The foregoing provisions of this
Section  shall enure to the benefit of any such owner,  holder or lessee,  shall
apply  notwithstanding  that, as a matter of law, this Lease may terminate  upon
the termination of the Superior Lease, or the foreclosure (including judgment of
foreclosure  and sale) of the Mortgage,  shall be  self-operative  upon any such
demand,  and no further  instrument  shall be  required  to give  effect to said
provisions.  Lessee,  however,  upon demand of any such owner, holder or lessee,
agrees  to  execute,  from  time to time,  instruments  in  confirmation  of the
foregoing provisions of this Section,  acknowledging such attornment and setting
forth the terms and conditions of its tenancy. Nothing contained in this Section
shall be construed to impair any right otherwise  exercisable by any such owner,
holder or lessee.

              ARTICLE 29 - SURRENDER; REMOVAL OF LESSEE'S PROPERTY

     SECTION 29.01. On the last day of the Term or on the earlier termination of
the Term,  Lessee shall  peaceably and quietly leave,  surrender and deliver the
Demised  Premises  to  Lessor,  together  with  (a)  all  alterations,  changes,
additions and improvements,  which may have been made upon the Demised Premises,
and (b) except for  Lessee's  Property,  all  fixtures  and articles of personal
property of any kind or nature  which  Lessee may have  installed or affixed on,
in, or to the Demised  Premises for use in  connection  with the  operation  and
maintenance of the Demised  Premises  (whether or not said property be deemed to
be fixtures),  all of the foregoing to be surrendered in good,  substantial  and
sufficient  repair,  order and  condition,  reasonable  use, wear and tear,  and
damage  by  fire  or  other  casualty,  excepted,  and  free  of  occupants  and
sublessees.

     SECTION  29.02.  On  or  prior  to  the  Expiration  Date  or  any  earlier
termination of this Lease, Lessee shall remove Lessee's Property,  and any items
referred to in clauses (a) or (b) of Section  29.01,  which Lessor shall request
Lessee to remove  (unless  Lessor  shall have  waived  such right as to any item
referred  to in  clause  (a) of  Section  29.01 at the time of the  granting  of
consent with respect thereto under Article 25), and Lessee shall pay or cause to
be paid the cost of repairing or remedying any damage caused  thereby,  provided
that no item of Lessee's Property may be removed if its removal would impair the
integrity  (structural or otherwise) of the Building or Building Equipment.  All
property not so removed shall be deemed  abandoned and may either be retained by
Lessor as its property or disposed of, without accountability,  at Lessee's sole
cost, expense and risk, in such manner as Lessor may see fit.

     SECTION 29.03.  If the Demised  Premises are not  surrendered in accordance
with the  provisions of this Article upon the  expiration or termination of this
Lease,  Lessor shall have all rights  given at law or in equity,  in the case of
holdovers,  to remove Lessee and anyone claiming through or under Lessee. In any
event,  Lessee  shall  and does  hereby  indemnify  Lessor  against  all loss or
liability  arising from delay by Lessee in so surrendering the Demised Premises,
including  any claims  made by any  succeeding  lessees  founded on such  delay.
Lessee expressly waives, for itself and for any person claiming through or under
Lessee  (including  creditors),  any rights  which lessee or any such person may
have under the  provisions  of any law in connection  with any holdover  summary
proceedings  which  Lessor may  institute  to  enforce  the  provisions  of this
Article. Lessee's obligations under this Article shall survive the expiration or
termination of this Lease.

     SECTION 29.04.  Lessee  acknowledges the extreme  importance to Lessor that
possession of the Demised  Premises be  surrendered  at the expiration or sooner
termination of this Lease.  In the event that Lessee fails to vacate the Demised
Premises at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease,  Lessee shall be
obligated  to pay Lessor  damages in an amount  equal to One  Hundred  and Fifty
(150%) percent of the annual Fixed Rent and Additional  Rent provided for on the
day preceding the Expiration Date for such period of time that Lessee holds over
on a per diem basis.

                           ARTICLE 30 - RENEWAL TERMS

     SECTION 30.01. Lessee named herein, shall have the right, at its option, to
extend  this Lease for Two (2) terms  (each a "Renewal  Term") of Five (5) years
each to commence on the Expiration  Date  originally  provided for herein and to
end at noon on the Fifth (5th)  anniversary of such  Expiration  Date originally
provided for herein and commencing on Fifth (5th) anniversary of Expiration Date
originally  provided  for  herein  and to  end  at  noon  on  the  Tenth  (10th)
anniversary of the Expiration Date originally provided for herein, respectively,
by giving  Lessor  notice of such  election at any time but not less than twelve
(12) months prior to the Expiration  Date and/or the Fifth (5th)  anniversary of
Expiration Date, as the case may be, originally  provided for herein (time being
of the essence  with respect  thereto),  and upon the giving of such notice this
Lease  thereupon  shall,   subject  to  the  provisions  of  Section  30.02,  be
automatically extended for each such Renewal Term with the same force and effect
as if such Renewal Term had been  originally  included in the Term,  without the
execution of any further instrument.

     SECTION  30.02.  Any notice of election to exercise the option to extend as
hereinbefore  provided  must be in  writing  and sent to Lessor as  provided  in
Article 21.  Neither the option  granted to Lessee in this Article to extend the
Term,  nor the exercise of such option by Lessee,  named  herein  shall  prevent
Lessor from exercising any option or right granted or reserved to Lessor in this
Lease to  terminate  this Lease with  respect to all or a portion of the Demised
Premises,  and the effective exercise of any such right of termination by Lessor
shall  terminate  any such renewal or  extension  and any right of Lessee to any
such renewal or extension  with respect to that portion of the Demised  Premises
so  terminated,  whether or not Lessee shall have  exercised  any such option to
extend  the Term.  Any such  option or right on the part of Lessor to  terminate
this Lease pursuant to the provisions  hereof shall continue  during any Renewal
Term.

     SECTION  30.03.  All of the terms,  covenants and  conditions of this Lease
shall  continue in full force and effect  during each such  Renewal  Term except
that (i) the Fixed  Rent for each such  Renewal  Term  shall be as  provided  in
Section  30.04  (all  other  rent  and  charges  payable  by  Lessee   remaining
unaffected),  and (b) there shall be no further  privilege  of extension of this
Lease beyond the second Renewal Term.

     SECTION 30.04. A. During each such Renewal Term, Lessee shall pay to Lessor
annual  Fixed  Rent,  at the same  times  and in the same  manner as in the Term
originally  provided  for,  at the annual  rate equal to the annual  fair rental
value of the Demised  Premises  (with  deduction for the cash value of free rent
and  leasehold  improvements  and  providing new base years for Taxes and Common
Area Maintenance Charges), which renewing, non-equity tenants are then receiving
in connection  with a lease for comparable  space in a building of the same age,
quality,  size,  location,  services,  amenities,  quality of  construction  and
appearance to that of the Building on the date of the  commencement of each such
Renewal  Term  with a term  equal  to  each  such  Renewal  Term  and  otherwise
containing  the  same  provisions  as this  Lease  contains,  as  determined  by
agreement  between Lessor and Lessee.  If, prior to the  commencement  of either
Renewal Term,  Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree on the amount of the annual
Fixed Rent during such Renewal Term, then in such event,  the  determination  of
such  annual  fair rental  value  shall be made by  arbitration  pursuant to the
provisions of Section 30.04. B. hereof.  If either Renewal Term,  shall commence
prior to  determination  of the amount of annual Fixed Rent payable  during such
Renewal Term, either by agreement or by decision of the arbitrators,  Lessee, in
the  meantime,  shall pay the monthly  installments  of Fixed Rent at the annual
rate payable under this Lease for the year ending on the Expiration Date, or the
Fifth (5th)  anniversary of the Expiration Date originally  provided for herein,
as the case may be. If monthly  installments of the amount agreed upon by Lessor
and Lessee, or found by the arbitrators, shall be greater than such amount, then
Lessee,  forthwith after such agreement or arbitrators'  decision,  shall pay to
Lessor,  for the period from the  commencement  of such Renewal Term to the last
day of the calendar  month in which the agreement or the  arbitrators'  decision
takes effect, the difference between the monthly installments  actually paid and
the monthly  installments  which should have been paid in  accordance  with such
agreement or  arbitrator's  decision,  together  with interest at the prime rate
plus two (2%) percent from the respective due dates of each monthly  installment
to the date of payment pursuant to this paragraph; and, thereafter, Lessee shall
pay the monthly  installments  at the new rate. If monthly  installments  of the
amount agreed upon by Lessor and Lessee,  or found by the arbitrators,  shall be
less  than  such  amount,  then  Lessor,   forthwith  after  such  agreement  or
arbitrators' decision, shall credit Lessee, for the period from the commencement
of such  Renewal  Term to the  last  day of the  calendar  month  in  which  the
agreement or the arbitrators'  decision takes effect, the difference between the
monthly  installments  actually paid and the monthly  installments  which should
have been paid in  accordance  with such  agreement  or  arbitrator's  decision,
together  with  interest  at the  prime  rate  plus  two (2%)  percent  from the
respective due dates of each monthly installment to the date of payment pursuant
to this paragraph; and, thereafter, Lessee shall pay the monthly installments at
the new rate.

     B. (1) In the event  that  Lessor  and  Lessee  are  unable to agree on the
amount of the annual Fixed Rent during either  Renewal Term,  then either Lessor
or Lessee (hereinafter referred to as the "Initiating Party") may give the other
party (hereinafter  called the "Responding Party") a notice designating the name
and address of the arbitrator  designated by the Initiating  Party to act on its
behalf in the arbitration process hereinafter described (the "Review Notice").

     (2) If the Initiating Party gives a Review Notice,  then within twenty (20)
days after giving of such Review Notice,  the Responding Party shall give notice
to  Initiating  Party  specifying  in such  notice  the name and  address of the
arbitrator designated by the Responding Party to act on its behalf. In the event
the Responding  Party shall fail to give such notice within such twenty (20) day
period, then the appointment of such arbitrator shall be made in the same manner
as  hereinafter  provided for the  appointment  of a third  arbitrator in a case
where two  arbitrators  are  appointed  hereunder  and the parties are unable to
agree to such  appointment.  The two  arbitrators  so chosen  shall meet  within
thirty (30) days after the second  arbitrator  is appointed  and shall  exchange
sealed envelopes each containing such arbitrators  written  determination of the
fair market  rent of the Demised  Premises  based on the  criteria  set forth in
Section 30.04.A.  The fair market rent specified by Lessor's arbitrator shall be
called the  "Lessor's  Submitted  Value" and the fair market rent  specified  by
Lessee's  arbitrator shall be called the "Lessee's  Submitted Value".  Copies of
such written  determinations  shall  promptly be sent to both Lessor and Lessee.
Any failure of either such  arbitrator to meet and exchange such  determinations
shall be acceptance of the other party's  arbitrator's  determination as to fair
market rent,  if, and only if, such failure  persists for ten (10) business days
after notice to whom such arbitrator is acting, and, provided that such ten (10)
business day period shall be extended by reason of any Unavoidable Delay. If the
higher  determination  of the fair market  rent for the Demised  Premises is not
more than one hundred and five (105%) percent of the lower  determination of the
fair market rent, then the fair market rent for such space shall be deemed to be
the average of the two determinations.  If, however, the higher determination is
more than one hundred and five (105%) percent of the lower  determination,  then
within ten (10) days of the date the arbitrators submitted their respective fair
market  rent   determinations,   the  two  arbitrators  shall  appoint  a  third
arbitrator.  In the event of their being  unable to agree upon such  appointment
within  ten (10) days after the  exchange  of the  sealed  envelopes,  the third
arbitrator shall be selected by the parties themselves if they can agree thereon
within a further  period of ten (10) days. If the parties do not so agree,  then
either party, on behalf of both and on notice to the other,  may request such an
appointment  by  the  American   Arbitration   Association   (or  any  successor
organization)  in accordance  with its rules then  prevailing or if the American
Arbitration  Association (or any successor  organization)  shall fail to appoint
said third arbitrator  within fifteen (15) days after such request is made, then
either  party may apply for such  appointment,  on notice to the  other,  to the
President of the Westchester  County Bar  Association  (who may consult with the
Chairman  of the Real  Property  Law  Committee  of the  Westchester  County Bar
Association).  Within  ten  (10)  days  after  the  appointment  of  such  third
arbitrator,  the Lessor's  arbitrator  shall submit Lessor's  Submitted Value to
such  third  arbitrator  and  the  Lessee's  arbitrator  shall  submit  Lessee's
Submitted Value to such third arbitrator.  Such third arbitrator  shall,  within
thirty (30) days after the end of such  fifteen  (15) day  period,  make his own
determination of the fair market rent of the Demised Premises using the criteria
set forth in  Section  30.04.A.  hereof,  and send  copies of his  determination
promptly to both Lessor and Lessee specifying  whether Lessor's  Submitted Value
or  Lessee's  Submitted  Value was  closer to the  determination  by such  third
arbitrator  of the  fair  market  rent of the  Demised  Premises.  Whichever  of
Lessor's  Submitted  Value or  Lessee's  Submitted  Value shall be closer to the
determination by such third  arbitrator  shall  conclusively be deemed to be the
fair market rent of the Demised Premises.

     (3) In no event shall the arbitrators enlarge upon, or alter or amend, this
Lease or  Lessor's  or  Lessee's  rights as  provided  in this  Lease,  it being
understood that the sole issue for determination by the arbitrators shall be the
single issue of fact of the annual fair rental value of the Demised  Premises as
provided in paragraph A of this Section 30.01.

     (4) Except as otherwise  provided in the following  sentence,  the fees and
expenses of an arbitration proceeding shall be borne by the parties equally. The
fees of  respective  counsel  engaged by the  parties  the fees and  expenses of
expert witnesses and other witnesses called and the cost of transcripts shall be
borne by the parties  engaging  such counsel or calling such witness or ordering
such transcripts.

     (5) The  arbitrators  selected by either  party shall have a minimum of ten
(10) years experience as an appraiser of commercial real property in Westchester
County and who is not related  directly or indirectly  to either  party.  In the
event that a third arbitrator is required,  such third arbitrator shall not have
any prior business relationship with either party hereto.

     SECTION  30.05.  The  rights  provided  to Lessee to extend  this  Lease as
provided in Section  30.01 is  conditioned  in all respects  upon there being no
Event of  Default  in the  observance  or  performance  of any  term,  covenant,
condition or agreement of Lessee's  part to be observed or performed  under this
Lease both at the time the notice of exercise is given and immediately  prior to
commencement of such Renewal Term. Any termination, cancellation or surrender of
this Lease shall  terminate any right of extension  hereunder for either Renewal
Term.

     SECTION 30.06.  If Lessee shall  effectively  exercise its option to extend
this lease for either  Renewal Term,  Lessor and Lessee,  upon demand of either,
shall execute and deliver to each other  duplicate  originals of an  instrument,
duly acknowledged,  setting forth (i) that the Term has been extended,  (ii) the
period of such  extension,  (iii) the annual  Fixed  Rent  payable  during  each
Renewal  Term and (iv) that such  extension  is upon and  subject  to all of the
terms, covenants, conditions and limitations contained herein.

                       ARTICLE 31- RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

     SECTION  31.01.A.  During and with respect of the period from  Commencement
Date up to and including the day preceding the Rent Commencement Date (both date
inclusive),  Lessor agrees that upon receipt of a bona fide offer to lease, from
another  prospective  tenant,  or its agent, at least Twenty  Thousand  (20,000)
contiguous rentable square feet or more of vacant space on the Sixth (6th) floor
of the south side of the  Building  off the main  elevator  bank,  it shall give
Lessee notice of the terms and conditions of the Bona-Fide  Offer and the right,
at its option,  to lease all such additional space (the  "Additional  Space") on
the same  terms and  conditions  of the  Bona-Fide  Offer.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  Lessee  hereby  acknowledges  and agrees that Lessor  shall have the
right to lease space on the Sixth (6th) floor of the Building  without  offering
same to Lessee,  so long as Lessor  retains at least  Twenty  Thousand  (20,000)
contiguous  rentable square feet of vacant space on the Sixth (6th) floor of the
south side of the  Building  off the main  elevator  bank,  it being  agreed and
understood  that  Lessor  does not have to offer  Lessee  the right to lease any
other  space  on  Sixth  (6th)  Floor  of  the  Building   except  as  otherwise
specifically provided for herein.

     B. Lessee shall,  within Ten (10) business days after receipt of the notice
from Lessor that it has  received  the  Bona-Fide  Offer,  notify  Lessor of its
intention to lease the Additional  Space (time being of the essence with respect
thereto) on the same terms and  conditions as contained in the Bona-Fide  Offer.
Lessee's  failure to notify Lessor within the Ten (10) business day period shall
be deemed a waiver of the right to lease the Additional Space.

     SECTION  31.02.  Any notice of election to exercise the right to expand the
Demised Premises as hereinbefore  provided must be in writing and sent to Lessor
as provided in Article 21. In addition, if prior to the exercise of the right to
expand the Demised Premises, Lessee herein named shall have assigned this Lease,
no notice by the then Lessee of  election to exercise an option to extend  shall
be valid  unless  joined in or  consented  to in writing by Lessee  herein named
(which consent,  in order for the exercise of such right to be effective,  shall
be  delivered  to Lessor at or prior to the time of the exercise of the right as
to which  consent of Lessee  herein  named had been  given).  Neither  the right
granted  to Lessee in this  Article  to expand  the  Demised  Premises,  nor the
exercise  of such right by Lessee,  shall  prevent  Lessor from  exercising  any
option or right  granted or reserved to Lessor in this Lease to  terminate  this
Lease,  and the effective  exercise of any such right of  termination  by Lessor
shall  terminate  any such renewal or  extension  and any right of Lessee to any
such renewal or extension,  whether or not Lessee shall have  exercised any such
right to  expand  the  Term.  Any such  option or right on the part of Lessor to
terminate  this Lease  pursuant  to the  provisions  hereof  shall  apply to the
Additional Space.

     SECTION  31.03.  Except for the terms of the  Bona-Fide  Offer,  all of the
terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease applicable to the Demised Premises
as originally  constituted shall be applicable to the Demised Premises including
the Additional Space.

     B. During and in respect of the Term hereof,  Lessee's  Proportionate Share
shall be increased by the rentable  square footage of all Additional  Space that
Lessee occupies in the Building.

     SECTION 31.04. If Lessee shall  effectively  exercise its right to hire the
Additional Space,  Lessor and Lessee,  upon demand of either,  shall execute and
deliver to each other duplicate  originals of an instrument,  duly acknowledged,
setting forth:  (i) that the Demised  Premises have been expanded to include the
Additional  Space;  (ii) the amount of such Additional  Space;  (iii) the annual
Fixed Rent payable during the Term; (iv) that such Additional  Space is upon and
subject to all of the terms,  covenants,  conditions and  limitations  contained
herein;  and (v) Lessee's  Proportionate  Share as  increased by the  Additional
Space.

     SECTION 31.05. The right of Lessee to hire the Additional Space as provided
in Section  31.01 is  conditioned  in all respects  upon there being no Event of
Default in the  observance or performance  of any term,  covenant,  condition or
agreement on Lessee's part to be observed or performed  under this Lease both at
the time the notice of exercise is given and immediately prior to the Additional
Space  Commencement  Date. Any  termination,  cancellation  or surrender of this
Lease shall terminate Lessee's right to hire the Additional Space.

                               ARTICLE 32- BROKERS

     SECTION  32.01.  Lessee  represents  that in connection  with this Lease it
dealt with no broker  other than Cushman & Wakefield  of  Connecticut,  Inc. and
Albert B. Ashforth,  Inc. (the "Brokers") nor has Lessee had any  correspondence
or other  communication  in connection with this Lease with any other person who
is a broker, and that so far as Lessee is aware the Brokers are the only brokers
who negotiated  this Lease.  Each party hereby  indemnifies  the other party and
holds it harmless from any and all loss,  cost,  liability,  claim,  damage,  or
expense  (including  court  costs  and  attorneys'  fees)  arising  out  of  any
inaccuracy  of the above  representation.  Lessor  agrees to pay the Brokers all

                        ARTICLE 33- RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

     SECTION 33.01.A. In the event that Lessee does not exercise its rights with
respect  to the  Additional  Space as  otherwise  specifically  provided  for in
Article 31 of this  Lease,  Lessor  hereby  agrees  that from and after the Rent
Commencement Date and prior to offering for lease the Additional Space, it shall
give  Lessee  notice  of and the right to, at its  option,  expand  the  Demised
Premises  herein to include the  Additional  Space with occupancy to commence on
the Additional Space Offer Commencement Date (as hereinafter defined) and to end
on the Expiration Date originally provided for herein.

     B. Lessee  shall,  within Thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from
Lessor that the  Additional  Space is available  for hire,  notify Lessor of its
intention to lease the Additional  Space (time being of the essence with respect
thereto).  Lessee's  failure to notify  Lessor within the Thirty (30) day period
shall be  deemed a waiver of the right to hire the  Additional  Space.  Upon the
giving of such notice the  Additional  Space shall be deemed added to and a part
of the  Demised  Premises,  with the same force and effect as if  originally  so
demised under this Lease.

     C. Lessee shall have the right to inspect the  Additional  Space,  prior to
exercising  its rights herein.  Lessee agrees to accept the Additional  Space in
its "AS IS" state and condition on the Additional Space Offer  Commencement Date
without any representation or warranty,  express or implied,  in fact or by law,
by Lessor,  and without  recourse to Lessor,  as to title  thereto,  the nature,
condition or usability  thereof or as to the use or occupancy  which may be made
thereof.

     SECTION  33.02.  Any notice of election to exercise the right to expand the
Demised Premises as hereinbefore  provided must be in writing and sent to Lessor
as provided in Article 21. In addition, if prior to the exercise of the right to
expand the Demised Premises, Lessee herein named shall have assigned this Lease,
no notice by the then Lessee of  election to exercise an option to extend  shall
be valid  unless  joined in or  consented  to in writing by Lessee  herein named
(which consent,  in order for the exercise of such right to be effective,  shall
be  delivered  to Lessor at or prior to the time of the exercise of the right as
to which  consent of Lessee  herein  named had been  given).  Neither  the right
granted  to Lessee in this  Article  to expand  the  Demised  Premises,  nor the
exercise  of such right by Lessee,  shall  prevent  Lessor from  exercising  any
option or right  granted or reserved to Lessor in this Lease to  terminate  this
Lease,  and the effective  exercise of any such right of  termination  by Lessor
shall  terminate  any such renewal or  extension  and any right of Lessee to any
such renewal or extension,  whether or not Lessee shall have  exercised any such
right to  expand  the  Term.  Any such  option or right on the part of Lessor to
terminate  this Lease  pursuant  to the  provisions  hereof  shall  apply to the
Additional Space.

     SECTION 33.03. The "Additional Space Offer  Commencement Date" shall be the

the date upon  which  Lessor  delivers  possession  of the  Additional  Space to
Lessee.

     SECTION 33.04.A.1. All of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease
applicable to the Demised Premises as originally constituted shall be applicable
to the Demised Premises including the Additional Space, except that Lessee shall
be entitled to the Additional  Space Allowance (as hereinafter  defined) and the
annual Fixed Rent provided for in Article 2 shall be increased as follows:

     (i)  during  and in  respect  of  the  period  from  the  Additional  Space
Commencement  Date to the day preceding the Second (2nd) Anniversary of the Rent
Commencement  Date (both  dates  inclusive)  by an amount each year equal to the
product of Twenty- Eight and 50/100 ($28.50) Dollars (exclusive of electric) and
the rentable square footage of the Additional Space; and.

     (ii) during and in respect of the period from the Second (2nd)  Anniversary
of the Rent  Commencement Date to the day preceding the Fourth (4th) Anniversary
of the Rent  Commencement  Date (both  dates  inclusive)  by an amount each year
equal to the  product  of Thirty  and  00/100  ($30.00)  Dollars  (exclusive  of
electric) and the rentable square footage of the Additional Space; and.

     (iii) during and in respect of the period from the Fourth (4th) Anniversary
of the Rent  Commencement  Date to the day preceding the Sixth (6th) Anniversary
of the Rent  Commencement  Date (both  dates  inclusive)  by an amount each year
equal to the product of Thirty-One  and 50/100  ($31.50)  Dollars  (exclusive of
electric) and the rentable square footage of the Additional Space; and.

     (iv) during and in respect of the period  from the Sixth (6th)  Anniversary
of the Rent  Commencement  Date to the Expiration Date (both dates inclusive) by
an amount  each year equal to the  product  of  Thirty-Two  and 50/100  ($32.50)
Dollars  (exclusive  of  electric)  and  the  rentable  square  footage  of  the
Additional Space.

     2. As used  herein,  "Additional  Space  Allowance"  shall  be equal to the
product of: (i) rentable  square  footage of the  Additional  Space and (ii) the
Proportionate  Additional  Space Allowance Factor (as hereinafter  defined).  As
used herein, the "Proportionate Additional Space Allowance Factor shall be equal
to the  product of: (i) Forty and 00/100  ($40.00)  Dollars and (ii) a fraction,
the  numerator  of which is the  number of months  remaining  in the Term of the
Lease as of the Additional Space Offer  Commencement Date and the denominator of
which is One Hundred and Twenty (120).

     B. During and in respect of the Term hereof,  Lessee's  Proportionate Share
shall be increased by the rentable  square footage of all Additional  Space that
Lessee occupies in the Building.

     SECTION 33.05. If Lessee shall  effectively  exercise its right to hire the
Additional Space,  Lessor and Lessee,  upon demand of either,  shall execute and
deliver to each other duplicate  originals of an instrument,  duly acknowledged,
setting forth:  (i) that the Demised  Premises have been expanded to include the
Additional  Space;  (ii) the amount of such Additional  Space;  (iii) the annual
Fixed Rent payable during the Term; (iv) that such Additional  Space is upon and
subject to all of the terms,  covenants,  conditions and  limitations  contained

Space.

     SECTION 33.06. The right of Lessee to hire the Additional Space as provided
in Section  33.01 is  conditioned  in all respects  upon there being no Event of
Default  under this Lease both at the time the notice of  exercise  is given and
immediately  prior  to  the  Additional  Space  Offer   Commencement  Date.  Any
termination,  cancellation or surrender of this Lease shall  terminate  Lessee's
right to hire the Additional Space.

     SECTION  33.07.A.  In the event that Lessee exercises its right to hire the
Additional  Space as provided in Section 33.01,  Lessor agrees that Lessee shall
have the right,  subject to Lessor's  consent,  which shall not be  unreasonably
withheld,  to install,  use and  maintain  and  internal  staircase  between the
Demised Premises and the Additional Space (the "Internal Staircase").

     B.  If  Lessor  shall  grant  its  consent  to  the  installation,  use  or
maintenance of the Internal Staircase,  then the same shall (i) be installed and
maintained  at the sole cost and expense of Lessee and in a location  reasonably
acceptable to Lessor, (ii) be installed and maintained in a good and workmanlike
manner,  and in compliance  with all applicable  Legal  Requirements  (including
existing zoning  requirements),  Insurance  Requirements and Environmental Laws,
(iii) be consistent  with the use of the Demised  Premises  provided for herein,
(iv) be performed in accordance with plans and specifications  approved prior to
the commencement of any work by the appropriate  Governmental Authorities and by
Lessor, which approval by Lessor will not be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned
or delayed,  (v) be  performed  under the  supervision  of a licensed  architect
reasonably   approved  by  Lessor  and  in  accordance  with  Lessor's  Standard
Requirements  For Alterations To Be Performed By Lessees',  as may be reasonably
amended  from time to time;  and (vi) be  subject to  Lessor's  right to require
Lessee,  upon the expiration or sooner  termination of this Lease, to remove the

condition existing prior to the installation of the Internal Staircase.
