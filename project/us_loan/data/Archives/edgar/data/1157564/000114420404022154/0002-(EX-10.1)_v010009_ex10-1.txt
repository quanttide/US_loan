       respective invoice related thereto;

II. ADVANCES, PAYMENTS.

       2.1 Revolving Advances.

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
including Section 2.1(b), each Lender, severally and not jointly, will make
Revolving Advances to Borrower in aggregate amounts outstanding at any time
equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the lesser of (x) the Maximum
Revolving Advance Amount less the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit or (y) an amount equal to the sum of:

               (i)  up to the following percentages, subject to the provisions
of Section 2.1(b) and (c) hereof ("Receivables Advance Rate"), of Eligible
Receivables during the following periods:

               A)   80% during the period from January 1 to June 30, inclusive,
of each year; and

               B)   85% during the period from July 1 to December 31, inclusive,
of each year, plus

               (ii) up to the lesser of (A) 60%, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.1(b) hereof, of the value of the Eligible Inventory, (B) 85% of the
appraised net orderly liquidation value of Eligible Inventory (as evidenced by
an Inventory appraisal satisfactory to Agent in its good faith business
judgment) or (C) $5,000,000 (provided that not more than $2,500,000 of said
amount may be based upon the foregoing percentages of Eligible Inventory that is
in-transit) in the aggregate at any one time ("Inventory Advance Rate" and
together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the "Advance Rates"),
minus

              (iii) the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit, minus

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

              (iv)  such reserves as Agent may reasonably deem proper and
necessary from time to time.

       The amount derived from (x) the sum of Sections 2.1(a)(y)(i) and (ii)
minus (y) the sum of Sections 2.1(a)(y)(iii) and (iv), at any time and from time
to time shall be referred to as the "Formula Amount". The Revolving Advances
shall be evidenced by one or more secured promissory notes (collectively, the
"Revolving Credit Note") substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
2.1(a).

       Without limiting the right of the Agent to establish such reserves as
it shall reasonably deem proper and necessary from time to time, Agent may
establish a reserve(s) in the amount of three months rent with respect to each
premises at which Borrower maintains any assets but which is not owned by
Borrower, for which Agent is not provided with an agreement from the landlord or
other party with an interest in the premises protecting Agent's and Lenders'
interest in those assets, satisfactory to Agent in its good faith business
judgment.

              (b)   Discretionary Rights. The Advance Rates may be increased or
decreased by Agent at any time and from time to time in the exercise of its good
faith business judgment. Borrower consents to any such increases or decreases
and acknowledges that decreasing the Advance Rates or increasing or imposing
reserves may limit or restrict Advances requested by Borrower. The rights of
Agent under this subsection are subject to the provisions of Section 15.2(b).

              (c) Adjustment to Aggregate Eligible Receivables. For purposes of
determining the amount of Revolving Advances that will from time to time be
available, the aggregate amount of Eligible Receivables outstanding from time to
time shall be deemed reduced by an amount which shall equal $35,000 in January
of each year and which shall increase by $35,000 in each subsequent month in
such year until it equals $420,000 in December of such year (and then in January
of the next year such amount shall again start at $35,000 and increase by
$35,000 for each following month through December).

2.2      Procedure for Revolving Advances Borrowing.

              (a) Borrower may notify Agent prior to 10:00 a.m. (California
time) on a Business Day of Borrower's request to incur, on that day, a Revolving
Advance hereunder. Should any amount required to be paid as interest hereunder,
or as fees or other charges under this Agreement or any other agreement with
Agent or Lenders, or with respect to any other Obligation, become due, same
shall be deemed a request for a Revolving Advance as of the date such payment is
due, in the amount required to pay in full such interest, fee, charge or
Obligation under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders,
and such request shall be irrevocable.

              (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, in the
event Borrower desires to obtain a Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrower shall give
Agent written notice by no later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the day
which is three (3) Business Days prior to the date such Eurodollar Rate Loan is
to be borrowed, specifying (i) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall
be a Business Day), (ii) the type of borrowing and the amount on the date of

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

such Advance to be borrowed, which amount shall be an integral multiple of
$1,000,000, and (iii) the duration of the first Interest Period therefor.
Interest Periods for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be for one, two, or three
months; provided, if an Interest Period would end on a day that is not a
Business Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day
falls in the next succeeding calendar month in which case the Interest Period
shall end on the next preceding Business Day. No Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
made available to Borrower during the continuance of a Default or an Event of
Default. After giving effect to each requested Eurodollar Rate Loan, including
those which are converted from a Domestic Rate Loan under Section 2.2(d), there
shall not be outstanding more than two (2) Eurodollar Rate Loans, in the
aggregate.

              (c) Each Interest Period of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall commence
on the date such Eurodollar Rate Loan is made and shall end on such date as
Borrower may elect as set forth in subsection (b)(iii) above provided that the
exact length of each Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the
practice of the interbank market for offshore Dollar deposits and no Interest
Period shall end after the last day of the Term.

       Borrower shall elect the initial Interest Period applicable to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan by its notice of borrowing given to Agent pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) or by its notice of conversion given to Agent pursuant to Section
2.2(d), as the case may be. Borrower shall elect the duration of each succeeding
Interest Period by giving irrevocable written notice to Agent of such duration
not later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the day which is three (3)
Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If Agent does not receive timely notice
of the Interest Period elected by Borrower, Borrower shall be deemed to have
elected to convert to a Domestic Rate Loan subject to Section 2.2(d)
hereinbelow.

              (d) Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Borrower may, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest
Period applicable to any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on any Business
Day with respect to Domestic Rate Loans, convert any such loan into a loan of
another type in the same aggregate principal amount provided that any conversion
of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made only on the last Business Day of the
then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If
Borrower desires to convert a loan, Borrower shall give Agent written notice by
no later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) (i) on the day which is three (3)
Business Days' prior to the date on which such conversion is to occur with
respect to a conversion from a Domestic Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
(ii) on the day which is one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which such
conversion is to occur with respect to a conversion from a Eurodollar Rate Loan
to a Domestic Rate Loan, specifying, in each case, the date of such conversion,
the loans to be converted and if the conversion is from a Domestic Rate Loan to
any other type of loan, the duration of the first Interest Period therefor.

              (e) At its option and upon written notice given prior to 10:00
a.m. (California time) at least three (3) Business Days' prior to the date of
such prepayment, Borrower may prepay the Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole at any
time or in part from time to time with accrued interest on the principal being
prepaid to the date of such repayment. Borrower shall specify the date of

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

prepayment of Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Loans and the amount of such
prepayment. In the event that any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan is
required or permitted on a date other than the last Business Day of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, Borrower shall indemnify Agent and
Lenders therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof.

              (f) Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders and hold Agent and
Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses that Agent and
Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment, conversion of
or any default by Borrower in the payment of the principal of or interest on any
Eurodollar Rate Loan or failure by Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a
prepayment of or conversion of or to a Eurodollar Rate Loan after notice thereof
has been given, including, but not limited to, any interest payable by Agent or
Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its
Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts
payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Agent or any Lender to
Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

              (g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Applicable
Law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender
(for purposes of this subsection (g), the term "Lender" shall include any Lender
and the office or branch where any Lender or any corporation or bank controlling
such Lender makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans) to make or maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans, the obligation of Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans hereunder shall forthwith be cancelled and Borrower shall, if any affected
Eurodollar Rate Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent,
either pay all such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert such affected
Eurodollar Rate Loans into loans of another type. If any such payment or
conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan is made on a day that is not the last day
of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrower shall
pay Agent, upon Agent's request, such amount or amounts as may be necessary to
compensate Lenders for any loss or expense sustained or incurred by Lenders in
respect of such Eurodollar Rate Loan as a result of such payment or conversion,
including (but not limited to) any interest or other amounts payable by Lenders
to lenders of funds obtained by Lenders in order to make or maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loan. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lenders to Borrower shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

       2.3 Disbursement of Advance Proceeds. All Advances shall be disbursed
from whichever office or other place Agent may designate from time to time and,
together with any and all other Obligations of Borrower to Agent or Lenders,
shall be charged to Borrower's Account on Agent's books. During the Term,
Borrower may use the Revolving Advances by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing,
all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The proceeds of each
Revolving Advance requested by Borrower or deemed to have been requested by
Borrower under Section 2.2(a) hereof shall, with respect to requested Revolving
Advances to the extent Lenders make such Revolving Advances, be made available
to Borrower on the day so requested by way of credit to Borrower's operating
account at PNC, or such other bank as Borrower may designate following
notification to Agent, in immediately available federal funds or other
immediately available funds or, with respect to Revolving Advances deemed to
have been requested by Borrower, be disbursed to Agent to be applied to the
outstanding Obligations giving rise to such deemed request.

                                      -26-

       2.4 Seasonal Advance. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each year during the "Seasonal Advance Period" and so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Lender, severally and not
jointly, will make a Seasonal Advance to Borrower in the sum equal to such
Lender's Commitment Percentage of $1,500,000. The Seasonal Advance made with
respect to any Seasonal Advance Period shall be, with respect to principal,
payable in full on the last day of such Seasonal Advance Period, subject to
acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement or
termination of this Agreement. The Seasonal Advance shall be evidenced by one or
more secured promissory notes (collectively, the "Seasonal Advance Note") in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4. Borrower and Agent agree
that the Seasonal Advance Note that evidences a Seasonal Advance for the
Seasonal Advance Period in one year may also evidence Seasonal Advances for
Seasonal Advance Periods in subsequent years, even though the original Seasonal
Advance that it evidenced will have been repaid.

       2.5 Maximum Advances. The aggregate balance of Revolving Advances
outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the Maximum Revolving
Advance Amount less the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount of all issued and
outstanding Letters of Credit or (b) the Formula Amount.

       2.6 Repayment of Advances.

           (a) The Revolving Advances shall be due and payable in full on the
last day of the Term subject to earlier prepayment as herein provided. Each
Seasonal Advance shall be due and payable on the last day of the Seasonal
Advance Period in which it was made, subject to mandatory prepayments as herein
provided.

           (b) Borrower recognizes that the amounts evidenced by checks, notes,
drafts or any other items of payment relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral
may not be collectible by Agent on the date received. In consideration of
Agent's agreement to conditionally credit Borrower's Account as of the Business
Day on which Agent receives those items of payment, Borrower agrees that, in
computing the charges under this Agreement, all items of payment shall be deemed
applied by Agent on account of the Obligations one (1) Business Day after (i)
the Business Day Agent receives such payments via wire transfer or electronic
depository check or (ii) in the case of payments received by Agent in any other
form, the Business Day such payment constitutes good funds in Agent's account.
Agent is not, however, required to credit Borrower's Account for the amount of
any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Agent and Agent may charge
Borrower's Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned to
Agent unpaid.

           (c) All payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable
hereunder, or under any of the Other Documents shall be made to Agent at the
Payment Office not later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the due date
therefor in lawful money of the United States of America in federal funds or
other funds immediately available to Agent. Agent shall have the right to
effectuate payment on any and all Obligations due and owing hereunder by
charging Borrower's Account or by making Advances as provided in Section 2.2
hereof.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

           (d) Borrower shall pay principal, interest, and all other amounts
payable hereunder, or under any related agreement, without any deduction
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any deduction for any setoff or
counterclaim.

       2.7 Repayment of Excess Advances. The aggregate balance of Advances
outstanding at any time in excess of the maximum amount of Advances permitted
hereunder shall be immediately due and payable without the necessity of any
demand, at the Payment Office, whether or not a Default or Event of Default has
occurred.

       2.8 Statement of Account. Agent shall maintain, in accordance with its
customary procedures, a loan account ("Borrower's Account") in the name of
Borrower in which shall be recorded the date and amount of each Advance made by
Agent and the date and amount of each payment in respect thereof; provided,
however, the failure by Agent to record the date and amount of any Advance shall
not adversely affect Agent or any Lender. Each month, Agent shall send to
Borrower a statement showing the accounting for the Advances made, payments made
or credited in respect thereof, and other transactions between Agent and
Borrower, during such month. The monthly statements shall be deemed correct and
binding upon Borrower in the absence of manifest error and shall constitute an
account stated between Lenders and Borrower unless Agent receives a written
statement of Borrower's specific exceptions thereto within thirty (30) days
after such statement is received by Borrower. The records of Agent with respect
to the loan account shall be conclusive evidence absent manifest error of the
amounts of Advances and other charges thereto and of payments applicable
thereto.

       2.9 Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Agent
shall issue or cause the issuance of standby and/or trade Letters of Credit
("Letters of Credit") for the account of Borrower; provided, however, that Agent
will not be required to issue or cause to be issued any Letters of Credit to the
extent that the issuance thereof would then cause the sum of (i) the outstanding
Revolving Advances plus (ii) the Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit to exceed the lesser of (x) the Maximum Revolving Advance
Amount or (y) the Formula Amount. The Maximum Undrawn Amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit shall not exceed in the aggregate at any time the Letter of
Credit Sublimit. All disbursements or payments related to Letters of Credit
shall be deemed to be Domestic Rate Loans consisting of Revolving Advances and
shall bear interest at the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic Rate Loans;
Letters of Credit that have not been drawn upon shall not bear interest.

       2.10 Issuance of Letters of Credit.

            (a) Borrower may request Agent to issue or cause the issuance of a
Letter of Credit by delivering to Agent, at the Payment Office, prior to 10:00
a.m. (California time), at least five (5) Business Days' prior to the proposed
date of issuance, Agent's form of Letter of Credit Application (the "Letter of
Credit Application") completed to the satisfaction of Agent; and, such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information as Agent may reasonably
request. Borrower also has the right to give instructions and make agreements
with respect to any application, any applicable letter of credit and security
agreement, any applicable letter of credit reimbursement agreement and/or any
other applicable agreement, any letter of credit and the disposition of
documents, disposition of any unutilized funds, and to agree with Agent upon
any amendment, extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit.

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

            (b) Each Letter of Credit shall, among other things, (i) provide for
the payment of sight drafts, other written demands for payment, or acceptances
of usance drafts when presented for honor thereunder in accordance with the
terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents described therein and (ii)
have an expiry date not later than twelve (12) months after such Letter of
Credit's date of issuance and in no event later than the last day of the Term.
Each standby Letter of Credit shall be subject either to the Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of
Commerce Publication No. 500, and any amendments or revision thereof adhered to
by the Issuer ("UCP 500") or the International Standby Practices
(ISP98-International Chamber of Commerce Publication Number 590) ("ISP98
Rules"), as determined by Agent, and each trade Letter of Credit shall be
subject to UCP 500.

            (c) Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to notify Lenders of the
request by Borrower for a Letter of Credit hereunder.

            (d) [Omitted].

            (e) [Omitted].

            (f) [Omitted].

            (g) [Omitted].

       2.11 Requirements For Issuance of Letters of Credit. Borrower shall
authorize and direct any Issuer to name Borrower as the "Applicant" or "Account
Party" of each Letter of Credit. If Agent is not the Issuer of any Letter of
Credit, Borrower shall authorize and direct the Issuer to deliver to Agent all
instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by the Issuer
pursuant to the Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon Agent's
instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection
with the Letter of Credit or the application therefor.

       2.12 Disbursements, Reimbursement.

            (a)  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
purchase from Agent a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing
thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the
Maximum Face Amount of such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing,
respectively.

            (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of
Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, Agent will promptly notify
Borrower. Provided that it shall have received such notice, Borrower shall
reimburse (such obligation to reimburse Agent shall sometimes be referred to as
a "Reimbursement Obligation") Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., California time on
each date that an amount is paid by Agent under any Letter of Credit (each such
date, a "Drawing Date") in an amount equal to the amount so paid by Agent. In
the event Borrower fails to reimburse Agent for the full amount of any drawing
under any Letter of Credit by 9:00 a.m., California time, on the Drawing Date,
Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and Borrower shall be deemed to
have requested that a Domestic Rate Loan be made by the Lenders to be disbursed

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the
unutilized portion of the lesser of Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or the
Formula Amount and subject to Section 8.2 hereof. Any notice given by Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.12(b) may be oral if immediately confirmed in
writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not
affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

            (c)  Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.12(b)
make available to Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to its
Commitment Percentage of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating
Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.12(d)) each be deemed to have made a
Domestic Rate Loan to Borrower in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails
to make available to Agent the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of
such amount by no later than 11:00 a.m., California time on the Drawing Date,
then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment,
from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at
a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate during the first three days
following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate
applicable to Domestic Rate Loans on and after the fourth day following the
Drawing Date. Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing
Date, but failure of Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in
sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall
not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.12(c), provided
that such Lender shall not be obligated to pay interest as provided in Section
2.12(c)(i) and (ii) until and commencing from the date of receipt of notice from
Agent of a drawing.

            (d) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted
into a Domestic Rate Loan to Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by
Section 2.12(b), because of Borrower's failure to satisfy the conditions set
forth in Section 8.2 (other than any notice requirements) or for any other
reason, Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from Agent a borrowing (each a
"Letter of Credit Borrowing") in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of
Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and
shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to a Domestic Rate Loan.
Each Lender's payment to Agent pursuant to Section 2.12(c) shall be deemed to be
a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and
shall constitute a "Participation Advance" from such Lender in satisfaction of
its Participation Commitment under this Section 2.12.

            (e) Each Lender's Participation Commitment shall continue until the
last to occur of any of the following events: (x) Agent ceases to be obligated
to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (y) no Letter of
Credit issued or created hereunder remains outstanding and uncancelled and (z)
all Persons (other than the Borrower) have been fully reimbursed for all
payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit.

       2.13 Repayment of Participation Advances.

            (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by Agent for its account of
immediately available funds from Borrower (i) in reimbursement of any payment
made by the Agent under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender
has made a Participation Advance to Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on
such a payment made by Agent under such a Letter of Credit, Agent will pay to
each Lender, in the same funds as those received by Agent, the amount of such

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

Lender's Commitment Percentage of such funds, except Agent shall retain the
amount of the Commitment Percentage of such funds of any Lender that did not
make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by Agent.

            (b) If Agent is required at any time to return to Borrower, or to a
trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any insolvency
proceeding, any portion of the payments made by Borrower to Agent pursuant to
Section 2.13(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or
interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of Agent, forthwith return
to Agent the amount of its Commitment Percentage of any amounts so returned by
Agent plus interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

       2.14 Documentation. Borrower agrees to be bound by the terms of the
Letter of Credit Application and by Agent's interpretations of any Letter of
Credit issued for Borrower's account and by Agent's written regulations and
customary practices relating to letters of credit, though Agent's
interpretations may be different from Borrower's own. In the event of a conflict
between the Letter of Credit Application and this Agreement, this Agreement
shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross
negligence or willful misconduct, Agent shall not be liable for any error,
negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following
Borrower's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any
modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.

       2.15 Determination to Honor Drawing Request. In determining whether to
honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary
thereof, Agent shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and
certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been
delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such
Letter of Credit and that any other drawing condition appearing on the face of
such Letter of Credit has been satisfied in the manner so set forth.

       2.16 Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations. Each Lender's
obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Advances or
Participation Advances as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and
the obligations of Borrower to reimburse Agent upon a draw under a Letter of
Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.16 under all
circumstances, including the following circumstances:

            (i)   any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender may have against Agent, Borrower or any other Person for any
reason whatsoever;

            (ii)  the failure of Borrower or any other Person to comply, in
connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth in
this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Advance, it being acknowledged that
such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing
and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section
2.12;

            (iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit;

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

            (iv)  any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by Borrower
or any Lender against the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of
any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim, defense or other right
which Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, any
successor beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds
thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), Agent or
any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any
underlying transaction between Borrower or any Subsidiaries of Borrower and the
beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);

            (v)   the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect
in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the form of or lack of
validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft,
demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in
connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or
provisions of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if
Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates has been notified thereof;

            (vi)  payment by Agent under any Letter of Credit against
presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

            (vii) the solvency of, or any acts or omissions by, any beneficiary
of any Letter of Credit, or any other Person having a role in any transaction or
obligation relating to a Letter of Credit, or the existence, nature, quality,
quantity, condition, value or other characteristic of any property or services
relating to a Letter of Credit;

            (viii) any failure by the Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates to
issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by Borrower, unless the Agent
has received written notice from Borrower of such failure within three (3)
Business Days after the Agent shall have furnished Borrower a copy of such
Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon
prior to receipt of such notice;

            (ix)  any Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or any Guarantor;

            (x)   any breach of this Agreement or any Other Document by any
party thereto;

            (xi) the occurrence or continuance of an insolvency proceeding with
respect to Borrower or any Guarantor;

            (xii) the fact that a Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

            (xiii) the fact that the Term shall have expired or this Agreement
or the Obligations hereunder shall have been terminated; and

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

            (xiv) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

       2.17 Indemnity. In addition to amounts payable as provided in Section
15.5, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless
Agent and any of Agent's Affiliates that have issued a Letter of Credit from and
against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, taxes, penalties,
interest, judgments, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal
counsel) which the Agent or any of Agent's Affiliates may incur or be subject to
as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit,
other than as a result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Agent as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or (b) the wrongful dishonor by the Agent or any of
Agent's Affiliates of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of
Credit, except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether
rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto Governmental
Body (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental Acts").

       2.18 Liability for Acts and Omissions. As between Borrower and Agent and
Lenders, Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of
the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the respective foregoing, Agent
shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection
with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if Agent shall have been notified
thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the
rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which
may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such
Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions
required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of
Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such
transferee, or any dispute between or among Borrower and any beneficiary of any
Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions
or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable,
telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in
interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or
otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such
Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under
such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the
control of Agent, including any governmental acts, and none of the above shall
affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of Agent's rights or powers
hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve Agent from liability
for Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or
omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In no
event shall Agent or Agent's Affiliates be liable to the Borrower for any
indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or
expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages
resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of
Credit.

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent and each of
its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good
faith by Agent or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on
behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation
if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the
terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a
previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such
dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of
wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the
same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with
any interest paid by Agent or its Affiliates; (iv) may honor any drawing that is
payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon
receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or
other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any
failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way
with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank
claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place
where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand
made on Agent or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the
applicant's request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity
issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an "Order") and honor any
drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject of such
Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in
connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such
Letter of Credit.

            In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by Agent under or in
connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and
certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith and without
gross negligence, shall not put Agent under any resulting liability to Borrower
or any Lender.

       2.19 Additional Payments. Any sums expended by Agent or any Lender due to
Borrower's failure to perform or comply with its obligations under this
Agreement or any Other Document including Borrower's obligations under Sections
4.2, 4.4, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 6.1 hereof, may be charged to Borrower's Account
as a Revolving Advance and added to the Obligations.

       2.20 Manner of Borrowing and Payment.

            (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Advances and Seasonal Advances shall
be advanced according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders.

            (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrower on account
of the principal of and interest on the Revolving Advances, shall be applied
to the Revolving Advances pro rata according to the applicable Commitment
Percentages of Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrower on
account of the principal of and interest on the Seasonal Advance, shall be
applied to the Seasonal Advance pro rata according to the applicable Commitment
Percentages of Lenders. Except as expressly provided herein, all payments
(including prepayments) to be made by Borrower on account of principal, interest
and fees shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made to
Agent on behalf of the Lenders to the Payment Office, in each case on or prior
to 10:00 a.m., California time, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.

            (c) (i)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
       Sections 2.20(a) and (b) hereof, commencing with the first Business Day
       following the Closing Date, each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be
       advanced by Agent and each payment by Borrower on account of Revolving
       Advances shall be applied first to those Revolving Advances advanced by
       Agent. On or before 10:00 a.m., California time, on each Settlement Date
       commencing with the first Settlement Date following the Closing Date,
       Agent and Lenders shall make certain payments as follows: (I) if the
       aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made by Agent during the
       preceding Week (if any) exceeds the aggregate amount of repayments
       applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such preceding Week,
       then each Lender shall provide Agent with funds in an amount equal to its
       applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (w) such
       Revolving Advances and (x) such repayments and (II) if the aggregate
       amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during
       such Week exceeds the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made
       during such Week, then Agent shall provide each Lender with funds in an
       amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference
       between (y) such repayments and (z) such Revolving Advances.

                (ii)  Each Lender shall be entitled to earn interest at the
       applicable Contract Rate on outstanding Advances which it has funded.

                (iii) Promptly following each Settlement Date, Agent shall

       submit to each Lender a certificate with respect to payments received and
       Advances made during the Week immediately preceding such Settlement Date.
       Such certificate of Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
       error.

            (d) If any Lender or Participant (a "benefited Lender") shall at any
time receive any payment of all or part of its Advances, or interest thereon, or
receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily
or by set-off) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and Collateral
received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's
Advances, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate payment or receipt
of Collateral is not expressly permitted hereunder, such benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participation in such portion of each
such other Lender's Advances, or shall provide such other Lender with the
benefits of any such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary
to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such
Collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the other Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. Each Lender so purchasing a portion of another
Lender's Advances may exercise all rights of payment (including rights of
set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct
holder of such portion.

            (e) Unless Agent shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in
writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the amount which would
constitute its applicable Commitment Percentage of the Advances available to

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Agent, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender shall
make such amount available to Agent on the next Settlement Date and, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. Agent
will promptly notify Borrower of its receipt of any such notice from a Lender.
If such amount is made available to Agent on a date after such next Settlement
Date, such Lender shall pay to Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of
(i) the daily average Federal Funds Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360
days) during such period as quoted by Agent, times (ii) such amount, times (iii)
the number of days from and including such Settlement Date to the date on which
such amount becomes immediately available to Agent. A certificate of Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph
(e) shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error. If such amount is not
in fact made available to Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days
after such Settlement Date, Agent shall be entitled to recover such an amount,
with interest thereon at the rate per annum then applicable to such Revolving
Advances hereunder, on demand from Borrower; provided, however, that Agent's
right to such recovery shall not prejudice or otherwise adversely affect
Borrower's rights (if any) against such Lender.

       2.21 Mandatory Prepayments.

            (a) Subject to Section 4.3 hereof, when Borrower sells or otherwise
disposes of any Collateral other than Inventory in the Ordinary Course of
Business, Borrower shall repay the Advances in an amount equal to the net
proceeds of such sale (i.e., gross proceeds less the reasonable costs of such
sales or other dispositions), such repayments to be made promptly but in no
event more than one (1) Business Day following receipt of such net proceeds, and
until the date of payment, such proceeds shall be held in trust for Agent. The
foregoing shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such sale otherwise
prohibited by the terms and conditions hereof. Such repayments shall be applied
(y) first, to the Seasonal Advance, and (z) second, to the remaining Advances in
such order as Agent may determine, subject to Borrower's ability to reborrow
Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms hereof.

            (b) Borrower shall prepay the outstanding amount of the Advances in
an amount equal to 25% of Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year commencing on or
after January 1, 2005, payable upon delivery of the financial statements to
Agent referred to in and required by Section 9.7 for such fiscal year but in any
event not later than ninety (90) days after the end of each such fiscal year,
which amount shall be applied (y) first, to the Seasonal Advance and (z) second,
to the remaining Advances in such order as Agent may determine subject to
Borrower's ability to reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the terms
hereof. In the event that the financial statement is not so delivered, then a
calculation based upon estimated amounts shall be made by Agent upon which
calculation Borrower shall make the prepayment required by this Section 2.21(b),
subject to adjustment when the financial statement is delivered to Agent as
required hereby. The calculation made by Agent shall not be deemed a waiver of
any rights Agent or Lenders may have as a result of the failure by Borrower to
deliver such financial statement.

       2.22 Use of Proceeds.

            (a) Borrower shall apply the proceeds of Advances to (i) repay
existing indebtedness owed to Manufacturers Bank, (ii) pay fees and expenses
relating to this transaction, and (iii) provide for its working capital needs
and reimburse drawings under Letters of Credit.

            (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.22(a) above,
neither the Borrower, the Guarantors nor any other Person which may in the
future become party to this Agreement or the Other Documents as Borrower or
Guarantor, intends to use nor shall they use any portion of the proceeds of the
Advances, directly or indirectly, for any purpose in violation of the Trading
with the Enemy Act.

       2.23 Defaulting Lender.

            (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
the event any Lender (x) has refused (which refusal constitutes a breach by such
Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) to make available its portion of
any Advance or (y) notifies either Agent or Borrower that it does not intend to
make available its portion of any Advance (if the actual refusal would
constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement)
(each, a "Lender Default"), all rights and obligations hereunder of such Lender
(a "Defaulting Lender") as to which a Lender Default is in effect and of the
other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express provisions
of this Section 2.23 while such Lender Default remains in effect.

            (b) Advances shall be incurred pro rata from Lenders (the
"Non-Defaulting Lenders") which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their
respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or
any pro rata share of any Advances required to be advanced by any Lender shall
be increased as a result of such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of
principal of any type of Advances shall be applied to reduce the applicable
Advances of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the outstanding
Advances of that type of all Lenders at the time of such application; provided,
that, such amount shall not be applied to any Advances of a Defaulting Lender at
any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Advances of any
Non-Defaulting Lender exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment Percentage
of all Advances then outstanding.

            (c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions
to Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating
to this Agreement and the Other Documents. All amendments, waivers and other
modifications of this Agreement and the Other Documents may be made without
regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the definition of "Required
Lenders", a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and not to have
Advances outstanding.

            (d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.23, the
rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to
indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in
this Section 2.23 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its
obligations under this Agreement and the Other Documents, shall alter such
obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender
hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which Borrower, Agent or any Lender may

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting
Lender hereunder.

            (e) In the event a Defaulting Lender retroactively cures to the
satisfaction of Agent the breach which caused a Lender to become a Defaulting
Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender and shall
be treated as a Lender under this Agreement.

III. INTEREST AND FEES.

       3.1  Interest. Interest on Advances shall be payable in arrears on the
first day of each month with respect to Domestic Rate Loans and, with respect to
Eurodollar Rate Loans, at the end of each Interest Period or, for Eurodollar
Rate Loans with an Interest Period in excess of three months (if any), at the
earlier of (a) each three months from the commencement of such Eurodollar Rate
Loan or (b) the end of the Interest Period. Interest charges shall be computed
on the actual principal amount of Advances outstanding during the month at a
rate per annum equal to (i) with respect to Revolving Advances, the Revolving
Interest Rate and (ii) with respect to the Seasonal Advance, the Seasonal
Advance Rate. Whenever, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Alternate
Base Rate is increased or decreased, the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic
Rate Loans shall be similarly changed without notice or demand of any kind by an
amount equal to the amount of such change in the Alternate Base Rate during the
time such change or changes remain in effect. The Eurodollar Rate shall be
adjusted with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans without notice or demand of any
kind on the effective date of any change in the Reserve Percentage as of such
effective date. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during
the continuation thereof, at the option of Agent or at the direction of Required
Lenders, the Obligations shall bear interest at the applicable Contract Rate
plus two percent (2%) per annum (the "Default Rate").

       3.2  Letter of Credit Fees.

            (a) Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders,
fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of
issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal
to the average daily face amount of each outstanding standby Letter of Credit
multiplied by two percent (2.0%) per annum, and equal to the average daily face
amount of each outstanding trade Letter of Credit multiplied by one percent
(1.0%) per annum, such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for
the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on the
first day of each quarter and on the last day of the Term, together with any and
all administrative, issuance, amendment, payment and negotiation charges of
Issuer with respect to Letters of Credit and all fees and expenses as agreed
upon by the Issuer and the Borrower in connection with any Letter of Credit,
including in connection with the opening, amendment or renewal of any such
Letter of Credit and any acceptances created thereunder and shall reimburse
Agent for any and all fees and expenses, if any, paid by Agent to the Issuer
(all of the foregoing fees, the "Letter of Credit Fees"). All such charges shall
be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder
and shall not be subject to rebate or pro-ration upon the termination of this
Agreement for any reason. Any such charge in effect at the time of a particular
transaction shall be the charge for that transaction, notwithstanding any
subsequent change in the Issuer's prevailing charges for that type of

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

transaction. All Letter of Credit Fees payable hereunder shall be deemed earned
in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be
subject to rebate or pro-ration upon the termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

                On demand made at any time (i) during the existence of an
Event of Default, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit or (ii)
within 30 days of the end of the Term, with respect to any outstanding Letters
of Credit with an expiry date, or that can be renewed, beyond the day before the
last day of the Term (without limitation upon any provision hereof which may
prohibit such an expiry date or renewal), Borrower will cause cash to be
deposited and maintained in an account with Agent, as cash collateral, in an
amount equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the outstanding Letters of
Credit, and Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, in its discretion, on
Borrower's behalf and in Borrower's name, to open such an account and to make
and maintain deposits therein, or in an account opened by Borrower, in the
amounts required to be made by Borrower, out of the proceeds of Receivables or
other Collateral or out of any other funds of Borrower coming into any Lender's
possession at any time. Agent will invest such cash collateral (less applicable
reserves) in such short-term money-market items as to which Agent and Borrower
mutually agree and the net return on such investments shall be credited to such
account and constitute additional cash collateral. Borrower may not withdraw
amounts credited to any such account except upon the occurrence of all of the
following: payment and performance in full of all Obligations, the termination
of this Agreement and the expiration of all Letters of Credit.

       3.3  (a) Closing Fee. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Borrower
shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders a closing fee of $99,000
less that portion of the deposit fee and the commitment fee heretofore paid by
Borrower to Agent remaining after application of such fees to out-of-pocket
expenses.

            (b) [Omitted].

       3.4  (a) Collateral Evaluation Fee. Borrower shall pay Agent a collateral
evaluation fee equal to $1,500 per month commencing on the first day of the
month following the Closing Date and on the first day of each month thereafter
during the Term. The collateral evaluation fee shall be deemed earned in full on
the date when same is due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to
rebate or proration upon termination of this Agreement for any reason.

            (b) Collateral Monitoring Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent on the
first day of each month following any month in which Agent performs any
collateral monitoring - namely any field examination, collateral analysis or
other business analysis, the need for which is to be determined by Agent and
which monitoring is undertaken by Agent or for Agent's benefit - a collateral
monitoring fee in an amount equal to $750 per day for each person employed to
perform such monitoring, plus all costs and disbursements incurred by Agent in
the performance of such examination or analysis.

       3.5  Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest and fees hereunder shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and for the actual number of days
elapsed. If any payment to be made hereunder becomes due and payable on a day
other than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable
Contract Rate during such extension.

       3.6  Maximum Charges. In no event whatsoever shall interest and other
charges charged hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under law. In the
event interest and other charges as computed hereunder would otherwise exceed
the highest rate permitted under law, such excess amount shall be first applied
to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrower, and if the then remaining
excess amount is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, Lenders
shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrower and the provisions hereof
shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate.

       3.7  Increased Costs. In the event that any Applicable Law, treaty or
governmental regulation, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof, or compliance by any Lender (for purposes of this Section
3.7, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or
bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or
any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central
bank or other financial, monetary or other authority, shall:

            (a) subject Agent or any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever
with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document or change the basis of
taxation of payments to Agent or any Lender of principal, fees, interest or any
other amount payable hereunder or under any Other Documents (except for changes
in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Agent or any Lender by the
jurisdiction in which it maintains its principal office);

            (b) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit,
assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for
the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, any office of
Agent or any Lender, including pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or

            (c) impose on Agent or any Lender or the London interbank Eurodollar
market any other condition with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any
Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Advances hereunder by an amount
that Agent or such Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any
payment (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the
Advances by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material, then, in
any case Borrower shall promptly pay Agent or such Lender, upon its demand, such
additional amount as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such additional
cost or such reduction, as the case may be, provided that the foregoing shall
not apply to increased costs which are reflected in the Eurodollar Rate, as the
case may be. Agent or such Lender shall certify the amount of such additional
cost or reduced amount to Borrower, and such certification shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

       3.8  Basis For Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. In the
event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that:

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

(a) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period; or

(b) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant maturity are not
available in the London interbank Eurodollar market, with respect to an
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or a proposed
conversion of a Domestic Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan,

then Agent shall give Borrower prompt written, telephonic or telegraphic notice
of such determination. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made as a Domestic Rate Loan, unless Borrower
shall notify Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) two (2) Business
Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing, that its request for such
borrowing shall be cancelled or made as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate
Loan, (ii) any Domestic Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan which was to have been
converted to an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be continued as or
converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrower shall notify Agent, no
later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) two (2) Business Days prior to the
proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of Eurodollar
Rate Loan, and (iii) any outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrower shall notify Agent, no
later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) two (2) Business Days prior to the last
Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such affected
Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be converted into an unaffected type of Eurodollar
Rate Loan, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period for such
affected Eurodollar Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn, Lenders
shall have no obligation to make an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan or
maintain outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans and Borrower shall not have
the right to convert a Domestic Rate Loan or an unaffected type of Eurodollar
Rate Loan into an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan.

       3.9  Capital Adequacy.

            (a) In the event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that
any Applicable Law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or
any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Body, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any
Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.9, the term "Lender" shall include Agent
or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and
the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or
maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on Agent or any Lender's capital as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder to a level below that which Agent or such Lender could
have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration Agent's and each Lender's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by Agent or any Lender to be material, then, from
time to time, Borrower shall pay upon demand to Agent or such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such
reduction. In determining such amount or amounts, Agent or such Lender may use
any reasonable averaging or attribution methods. The protection of this Section
3.9 shall be available to Agent and each Lender regardless of any possible

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

contention of invalidity or inapplicability with respect to the Applicable Law,
regulation or condition.

            (b) A certificate of Agent or such Lender setting forth such amount
or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate Agent or such Lender with respect
to Section 3.9(a) hereof when delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

       3.10 Gross Up for Taxes. If Borrower shall be required by Applicable Law
to withhold or deduct any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under this
Agreement or any of the Other Documents to Agent, or any Lender, assignee of any
Lender, or Participant (each, individually, a "Payee" and collectively, the
"Payees"), (a) the sum payable to such Payee or Payees, as the case may be,
shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required
withholding or deductions, the applicable Payee or Payees receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deductions
been made (the "Gross-Up Payment"), (b) Borrower shall make such withholding or
deductions, and (c) Borrower shall pay the full amount withheld or deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with Applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be obligated to make any
portion of the Gross-Up Payment that is attributable to any withholding or
deductions that would not have been paid or claimed had the applicable Payee or
Payees properly claimed a complete exemption with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 3.11 hereof.

       3.11 Withholding Tax Exemption.

            (a) Each Payee that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof (and, upon the written request of Agent,
each other Payee) agrees that it will deliver to Borrower and Agent two (2) duly
completed appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under
ss.1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax Regulations ("Regulations")) certifying its
status (i.e., U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of
reduced, or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax
treaty or an exemption provided by the Code. The term "Withholding Certificate"
means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related
statements and certifications as required under ss.1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of
the Regulations; a statement described in ss.1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the
Regulations; or any other certificates under the Code or Regulations that
certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or
foreign person.

            (b) Each Payee required to deliver to Borrower and Agent a valid
Withholding Certificate pursuant to Section 3.11(a) hereof shall deliver such
valid Withholding Certificate as follows: (A) each Payee which is a party hereto
on the Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are
payable by Borrower hereunder for the account of such Payee; (B) each Payee
shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days
before the effective date of such assignment or participation (unless Agent in
its sole discretion shall permit such Payee to deliver such Withholding
Certificate less than five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it
shall be due on the date specified by Agent). Each Payee which so delivers a
valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes to deliver to Borrower and
Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor
form) on or before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes
obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto
or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by Borrower or
Agent.

            (c) Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate
claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax required under
Section 3.11(b) hereof, Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States
federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable
judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed
upon a withholding agent under ss.1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations. Further, Agent
is indemnified under ss.1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and
demands of any Payee for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in
accordance with regulations under ss.1441 of the Code.

IV.    COLLATERAL: GENERAL TERMS.

       4.1  Security Interest in the Collateral. To secure the prompt payment

Borrower hereby authorizes Agent to file against Borrower, one or more
financing, continuation or amendment statements pursuant to the Uniform
Commercial Code in form and substance satisfactory to Agent (which statements
may have a description of collateral which is broader than that set forth
herein). All charges, expenses and fees Agent may incur in doing any of the
foregoing, and any local taxes relating thereto, shall be charged to Borrower's

a correct and complete list as of the Closing Date of the location, by state and
street address, of all Real Property owned or leased by Borrower, together with
the names and addresses of any landlords.

       4.6  Defense of Agent's and Lenders' Interests. Until (a) payment and
performance in full of all of the Obligations and (b) termination of this
Agreement, Agent's interests in the Collateral shall continue in full force and
effect. During such period Borrower shall not, without Agent's prior written
consent, pledge, sell (except Inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business and
Equipment to the extent permitted in Section 4.3 hereof), assign, transfer,
create or suffer to exist a Lien upon or encumber or allow or suffer to be
encumbered in any way except for Permitted Encumbrances, any part of the
Collateral. Borrower shall defend Agent's interests in the Collateral against
any and all Persons whatsoever. At any time following demand by Agent for
payment of all Obligations, Agent shall have the right to take possession of the
indicia of the Collateral and the Collateral in whatever physical form
contained, including: labels, stationery, documents, instruments and advertising
materials. If Agent exercises this right to take possession of the Collateral,
Borrower shall, upon demand, assemble it in the best manner possible and make it
available to Agent at a place reasonably convenient to Agent. In addition, with
respect to all Collateral, Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to all of the
rights and remedies set forth herein and further provided by the Uniform
Commercial Code or other Applicable Law. Borrower shall, and Agent may, at its
option, instruct all suppliers, carriers, forwarders, warehousers or others
receiving or holding cash, checks, Inventory, documents or instruments in which
Agent holds a security interest to deliver same to Agent and/or subject to
Agent's order and if they shall come into Borrower's possession, they, and each
of them, shall be held by Borrower in trust as Agent's trustee, and Borrower
will immediately deliver them to Agent in their original form together with any
necessary endorsement.

       4.7  Books and Records. Borrower shall (a) keep proper books of record
and account in which full, true and correct entries will be made of all dealings
or transactions of or in relation to its business and affairs; (b) set up on its
books accruals with respect to all taxes, assessments, charges, levies and
claims; and (c) on a reasonably current basis set up on its books, from its
earnings, allowances against doubtful Receivables, advances and investments and
all other proper accruals (including by reason of enumeration, accruals for
premiums, if any, due on required payments and accruals for depreciation,
obsolescence, or amortization of properties), which should be set aside from
such earnings in connection with its business. All determinations pursuant to
this subsection shall be made in accordance with, or as required by, GAAP
consistently applied in the opinion of such independent public accountant as
shall then be regularly engaged by Borrower.

       4.8  Financial Disclosure. Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and
directs all accountants and auditors employed by Borrower at any time during the
Term to exhibit and deliver to Agent and each Lender copies of any of Borrower's
financial statements, trial balances or other accounting records of any sort
belonging to the Borrower in the accountant's or auditor's possession, and to
disclose to Agent and each Lender any information such accountants may have
concerning Borrower's financial status and business operations. Borrower hereby
authorizes all Governmental Bodies to furnish to Agent and each Lender copies of
reports or examinations relating to Borrower, whether made by Borrower or
otherwise; however, Agent and each Lender will attempt to obtain such
information or materials directly from Borrower prior to obtaining such
information or materials from such accountants or Governmental Bodies.

       4.9  Compliance with Laws. Borrower shall comply with all Applicable Laws
with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or to the operation of
Borrower's business the non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The assets of Borrower at all times shall be
maintained in accordance with the requirements of all insurance carriers which
provide insurance with respect to the assets of Borrower so that such insurance
shall remain in full force and effect.

       4.10 Inspection of Premises. At all reasonable times Agent and each
Lender shall have full access to and the right to audit, check, inspect and make
abstracts and copies from Borrower's books, records, audits, correspondence and
all other papers relating to the Collateral and the operation of Borrower's
business. Agent, any Lender and their agents may enter upon any of Borrower's
premises at any time during business hours and at any other reasonable time, and
from time to time, for the purpose of inspecting the Collateral and any and all
records pertaining thereto and the operation of Borrower's business. Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that as of the date hereof it is Agent's intention to
perform field examinations not less frequently than four times per year.

       4.11 Insurance. The assets and properties of Borrower at all times shall
be maintained in accordance with the requirements of all insurance carriers
which provide insurance with respect to the assets and properties of Borrower so
that such insurance shall remain in full force and effect. Borrower shall bear
the full risk of any loss of any nature whatsoever with respect to the
Collateral. At Borrower's own cost and expense in amounts and with carriers
acceptable to Agent, Borrower shall (a) keep all its insurable properties and
properties in which Borrower has an interest insured against the hazards of
fire, flood, sprinkler leakage, those hazards covered by extended coverage
insurance and such other hazards, and for such amounts, as is customary in the
case of companies engaged in businesses similar to Borrower's including business
interruption insurance; (b) [omitted]; (c) maintain public and product liability
insurance against claims for personal injury, death or property damage suffered
by others; (d) maintain all such worker's compensation or similar insurance as
may be required under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which Borrower is
engaged in business; (e) [omitted]; (f) furnish Agent with (i) copies of all
policies and evidence of the maintenance of such policies by the renewal thereof
at least thirty (30) days before any expiration date, and (ii) appropriate loss
payable endorsements in form and substance satisfactory to Agent, naming Agent
as a co-insured and loss payee as its interests may appear with respect to all
insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a) and (c) above, and providing (A)
that all proceeds thereunder shall be payable to Agent, (B) no such insurance
shall be affected by any act or neglect of the insured or owner of the property

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

described in such policy, and (C) that such policy and loss payable clauses may
not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days' prior
written notice is given to Agent. In the event of any loss thereunder, the
carriers named therein hereby are directed by Agent and Borrower to make payment
for such loss to Agent and not to Borrower and Agent jointly. If any insurance
losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to Borrower and
Agent jointly, Agent may endorse Borrower's name thereon and do such other
things as Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. Agent is hereby
authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to
in clauses (a) and (b) above. All loss recoveries received by Agent upon any
such insurance may be applied to the Obligations, in such order as Agent in its
sole discretion shall determine. Any surplus shall be paid by Agent to Borrower
or applied as may be otherwise required by law. Any deficiency thereon shall be
paid by Borrower to Agent, on demand. Anything hereinabove to the contrary
notwithstanding, and subject to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth
below, Agent shall remit to Borrower insurance proceeds received by Agent during
any calendar year under insurance policies procured and maintained by Borrower
which insure Borrower's insurable properties to the extent such insurance
proceeds do not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate during such calendar year or
$25,000 per occurrence. In the event the amount of insurance proceeds received
by Agent for any occurrence exceeds $25,000, then Agent shall not be obligated
to remit the insurance proceeds to Borrower unless Borrower shall provide Agent
with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the insurance proceeds will
be used by Borrower to repair, replace or restore the insured property which was
the subject of the insurable loss. In the event Borrower have previously
received (or, after giving effect to any proposed remittance by Agent to
Borrower would receive) insurance proceeds which equal or exceed $100,000 in the
aggregate during any calendar year, then Agent may, in its sole discretion,
either remit the insurance proceeds to Borrower upon Borrower providing Agent
with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the insurance proceeds will
be used by Borrower to repair, replace or restore the insured property which was
the subject of the insurable loss, or apply the proceeds to the Obligations, as
aforesaid. The agreement of Agent to remit insurance proceeds in the manner
above provided shall be subject in each instance to satisfaction of each of the
following conditions: (x) No Event of Default or Default shall then have
occurred, and (y) Borrower shall use such insurance proceeds to repair, replace
or restore the insurable property which was the subject of the insurable loss
and for no other purpose.

       4.12 Failure to Pay Insurance. If Borrower fails to obtain insurance as
hereinabove provided, or to keep the same in force, Agent, if Agent so elects,
may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor on behalf of Borrower,
and charge Borrower's Account therefor as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate
Loan and such expenses so paid shall be part of the Obligations.

       4.13 Payment of Taxes. Borrower will pay, when due, all taxes,
assessments and other Charges lawfully levied or assessed upon Borrower or any
of the Collateral including real and personal property taxes, assessments and
charges and all franchise, income, employment, social security benefits,
withholding, and sales taxes. If any tax by any Governmental Body is or may be
imposed on or as a result of any transaction between Borrower and Agent or any
Lender which Agent or any Lender may be required to withhold or pay or if any
taxes, assessments, or other Charges remain unpaid after the date fixed for
their payment, or if any claim shall be made which, in Agent's or any Lender's
opinion, may possibly create a valid Lien on the Collateral, Agent may without

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

notice to Borrower pay the taxes, assessments or other Charges and Borrower
hereby indemnifies and holds Agent and each Lender harmless in respect thereof.
Agent will not pay any taxes, assessments or Charges to the extent that Borrower
has contested or disputed those taxes, assessments or Charges in good faith, by
expeditious protest, administrative or judicial appeal or similar proceeding
provided that any related tax lien is stayed and sufficient reserves are
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent to protect Agent's security
interest in or Lien on the Collateral. The amount of any payment by Agent under
this Section 4.13 shall be charged to Borrower's Account as a Revolving Advance
and added to the Obligations and, until Borrower shall furnish Agent with an
indemnity therefor (or supply Agent with evidence satisfactory to Agent that due
provision for the payment thereof has been made), Agent may hold without
interest any balance standing to Borrower's credit and Agent shall retain its
security interest in and Lien on any and all Collateral held by Agent.

       4.14 Payment of Leasehold Obligations. Borrower shall at all times pay,
when and as due, its rental obligations under all leases under which it is a
tenant, and shall otherwise comply, in all material respects, with all other
terms of such leases and keep them in full force and effect and, at Agent's
request will provide evidence of having done so.

       4.15 Receivables.

            (a) Nature of Receivables. Each of the Receivables shall be a bona
fide and valid account representing a bona fide indebtedness incurred by the
Customer therein named, for a fixed sum as set forth in the invoice relating
thereto (provided immaterial or unintentional invoice errors shall not be deemed
to be a breach hereof) with respect to an absolute sale or lease and delivery of
goods upon stated terms of Borrower, or work, labor or services theretofore
rendered by Borrower as of the date each Receivable is created. Same shall be
due and owing in accordance with Borrower's standard terms of sale without
dispute, setoff or counterclaim except as may be stated on the accounts
receivable schedules delivered by Borrower to Agent.

            (b) Solvency of Customers. Each Customer, to the best of Borrower's
knowledge, as of the date each Receivable is created, is and will be solvent and
able to pay all Receivables on which the Customer is obligated in full when due
or with respect to such Customers of Borrower who are not solvent Borrower has
set up on its books and in its financial records bad debt reserves adequate to
cover such Receivables.

            (c) Location of Borrower. Borrower's chief executive office is
located at 5711 Buckingham Parkway, Culver City, California 90230. Until written
notice is given to Agent by Borrower of any other office at which Borrower keeps
its records pertaining to Receivables, all such records shall be kept at such
executive office.

            (d) Collection of Receivables. Until Borrower's authority to do so
is terminated by Agent (which notice Agent may give at any time following the
occurrence of an Event of Default or a Default or when Agent in its sole
discretion deems it to be in Lenders' best interest to do so), Borrower will, at
Borrower's sole cost and expense, but on Agent's behalf and for Agent's account,
collect as Agent's property and in trust for Agent all amounts received on
Receivables, and shall not commingle such collections with Borrower's funds or
use the same except to pay Obligations. Borrower shall deposit in the Blocked
Account or, upon request by Agent, deliver to Agent, in original form and on the

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

date of receipt thereof, all checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances,
cash and other evidences of Indebtedness.

            (e) Notification of Assignment of Receivables. At any time following
the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Default, Agent shall have the right
to send notice of the assignment of, and Agent's security interest in and Lien
on, the Receivables to any and all Customers or any third party holding or
otherwise concerned with any of the Collateral. Thereafter, Agent shall have the
sole right to collect the Receivables, take possession of the Collateral, or
both. Agent's actual collection expenses, including, but not limited to,
stationery and postage, telephone and telegraph, secretarial and clerical
expenses and the salaries of any collection personnel used for collection, may
be charged to Borrower's Account and added to the Obligations.

            (f) Power of Agent to Act on Borrower's Behalf. Agent shall have the
right to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver in the name of Agent or
Borrower any and all checks, drafts and other instruments for the payment of
money relating to the Receivables, and Borrower hereby waives notice of
presentment, protest and non-payment of any instrument so endorsed. Borrower
hereby constitutes Agent or Agent's designee as Borrower's attorney with power
(i) to endorse Borrower's name upon any notes, acceptances, checks, drafts,
money orders or other evidences of payment or Collateral; (ii) to sign
Borrower's name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the
Receivables, drafts against Customers, assignments and verifications of
Receivables; (iii) to send verifications of Receivables to any Customer; (iv) to
sign Borrower's name on all financing statements or any other documents or
instruments deemed necessary or appropriate by Agent to preserve, protect, or
perfect Agent's interest in the Collateral and to file same; (v) to demand
payment of the Receivables; (vi) to enforce payment of the Receivables by legal
proceedings or otherwise; (vii) to exercise all of Borrower's rights and
remedies with respect to the collection of the Receivables and any other
Collateral; (viii) to settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew the
Receivables; (ix) to settle, adjust or compromise any legal proceedings brought
to collect Receivables; (x) to prepare, file and sign Borrower's name on a proof
of claim in bankruptcy or similar document against any Customer; (xi) to
prepare, file and sign Borrower's name on any notice of Lien, assignment or
satisfaction of Lien or similar document in connection with the Receivables; and
(xii) to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out this Agreement. All
acts of said attorney or designee are hereby ratified and approved, and said
attorney or designee shall not be liable for any acts of omission or commission
nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or of law, unless done
maliciously or with gross (not mere) negligence; this power being coupled with
an interest is irrevocable while any of the Obligations remain unpaid. Agent
shall have the right at any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default
or Default, to change the address for delivery of mail addressed to Borrower to
such address as Agent may designate and to receive, open and dispose of all mail
addressed to Borrower.

            (g) No Liability. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall, under any
circumstances or in any event whatsoever, have any liability for any error or
omission or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, collection or payment
of any of the Receivables or any instrument received in payment thereof, or for
any damage resulting therefrom. Following the occurrence of an Event of Default
or Default, Agent may, without notice or consent from Borrower, sue upon or
otherwise collect, extend the time of payment of, compromise or settle for cash,

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

credit or upon any terms any of the Receivables or any other securities,
instruments or insurance applicable thereto and/or release any obligor thereof.
Agent is authorized and empowered to accept following the occurrence of an Event
of Default or Default the return of the goods represented by any of the
Receivables, without notice to or consent by Borrower, all without discharging
or in any way affecting Borrower's liability hereunder.

            (h) Establishment of a Lockbox Account, Dominion Account. All
proceeds of Collateral shall be deposited by Borrower into either (i) a lockbox
account, dominion account or such other "blocked account" ("Blocked Accounts")
established at Agent (a "Blocked Account Bank") pursuant to an arrangement with
such Blocked Account Bank as may be selected by Borrower and be acceptable to
Agent or (ii) depository accounts ("Depository Accounts") established at the
Agent for the deposit of such proceeds. Borrower, Agent and each Blocked Account
Bank shall enter into a deposit account control agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to Agent directing such Blocked Account Bank to transfer such funds
so deposited to Agent, either to any account maintained by Agent at said Blocked
Account Bank or by wire transfer to appropriate account(s) of Agent. All funds
deposited in such Blocked Accounts shall immediately become the property of
Agent and Borrower shall obtain the agreement by such Blocked Account Bank to
waive any offset rights against the funds so deposited. Neither Agent nor any
Lender assumes any responsibility for such blocked account arrangement,
including any claim of accord and satisfaction or release with respect to
deposits accepted by any Blocked Account Bank thereunder. All deposit accounts
and investment accounts of Borrower and its Subsidiaries are set forth on
Schedule 4.15(h).

            (i) Adjustments. Borrower will not, without Agent's consent,
compromise or adjust any Receivables (or extend the time for payment thereof) or
accept any returns of merchandise or grant any additional discounts, allowances
or credits thereon except for those compromises, adjustments, returns,
discounts, credits and allowances as have been heretofore customary in the
business of Borrower.

       4.16 Inventory. To the extent Inventory held for sale or lease has been
produced by Borrower, it has been and will be produced by Borrower in accordance
with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and all rules,
regulations and orders thereunder.

       4.17 Maintenance of Equipment. The Equipment shall be maintained in good
operating condition and repair (reasonable wear and tear excepted) and all
necessary replacements of and repairs thereto shall be made so that the value
and operating efficiency of the Equipment shall be maintained and preserved.
Borrower shall not use or operate the Equipment in violation of any law,
statute, ordinance, code, rule or regulation. Borrower shall have the right to
sell Equipment to the extent set forth in Section 4.3 hereof.

       4.18 Exculpation of Liability. Nothing herein contained shall be
construed to constitute Agent or any Lender as Borrower's agent for any purpose
whatsoever, nor shall Agent or any Lender be responsible or liable for any
shortage, discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction of any part of the Collateral
wherever the same may be located and regardless of the cause thereof. Neither
Agent nor any Lender, whether by anything herein or in any assignment or
otherwise, assume any of Borrower's obligations under any contract or agreement
assigned to Agent or such Lender, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be
responsible in any way for the performance by Borrower of any of the terms and
conditions thereof.

       4.19 Environmental Matters.

            (a) Borrower shall ensure that the Real Property and all operations
and businesses conducted thereon remains in compliance with all Environmental
Laws and they shall not place or permit to be placed any Hazardous Substances on
any Real Property except as permitted by Applicable Law or appropriate
governmental authorities.

            (b) Borrower shall establish and maintain a system to assure and
monitor continued compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws which system
shall include periodic reviews of such compliance.

            (c) Borrower shall (i) employ in connection with the use of the Real
Property appropriate technology necessary to maintain compliance with any
applicable Environmental Laws and (ii) dispose of any and all Hazardous Waste
generated at the Real Property only at facilities and with carriers that
maintain valid permits under RCRA and any other applicable Environmental Laws.
Borrower shall use its best efforts to obtain certificates of disposal, such as
hazardous waste manifest receipts, from all treatment, transport, storage or
disposal facilities or operators employed by Borrower in connection with the
transport or disposal of any Hazardous Waste generated at the Real Property.

            (d) In the event Borrower obtains, gives or receives notice of any
Release or threat of Release of a reportable quantity of any Hazardous
Substances at the Real Property (any such event being hereinafter referred to as
a "Hazardous Discharge") or receives any notice of violation, request for
information or notification that it is potentially responsible for investigation
or cleanup of environmental conditions at the Real Property, demand letter or
complaint, order, citation, or other written notice with regard to any Hazardous
Discharge or violation of Environmental Laws affecting the Real Property or
Borrower's interest therein (any of the foregoing is referred to herein as an
"Environmental Complaint") from any Person, including any state agency
responsible in whole or in part for environmental matters in the state in which
the Real Property is located or the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (any such person or entity hereinafter the "Authority"), then Borrower
shall, within five (5) Business Days, give written notice of same to Agent
detailing facts and circumstances of which Borrower is aware giving rise to the
Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. Such information is to be
provided to allow Agent to protect its security interest in and Lien on the Real
Property and the Collateral and is not intended to create nor shall it create
any obligation upon Agent or any Lender with respect thereto.

            (e) Borrower shall promptly forward to Agent copies of any request
for information, notification of potential liability, demand letter relating to
potential responsibility with respect to the investigation or cleanup of
Hazardous Substances at any other site owned, operated or used by Borrower to
dispose of Hazardous Substances and shall continue to forward copies of
correspondence between Borrower and the Authority regarding such claims to Agent
until the claim is settled. Borrower shall promptly forward to Agent copies of
all documents and reports concerning a Hazardous Discharge at the Real Property
that Borrower is required to file under any Environmental Laws. Such information

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

is to be provided solely to allow Agent to protect Agent's security interest in
and Lien on the Real Property and the Collateral.

            (f) Borrower shall respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge or
Environmental Complaint and take all necessary action in order to safeguard the
health of any Person and to avoid subjecting the Collateral or Real Property to
any Lien. If Borrower shall fail to respond promptly to any Hazardous Discharge
or Environmental Complaint or Borrower shall fail to comply with any of the
requirements of any Environmental Laws, Agent on behalf of Lenders may, but
without the obligation to do so, for the sole purpose of protecting Agent's
interest in the Collateral: (A) give such notices or (B) enter onto the Real
Property (or authorize third parties to enter onto the Real Property) and take
such actions as Agent (or such third parties as directed by Agent) deem
reasonably necessary or advisable, to clean up, remove, mitigate or otherwise
deal with any such Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. All
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent and Lenders (or such third
parties) in the exercise of any such rights, including any sums paid in
connection with any judicial or administrative investigation or proceedings,
fines and penalties, together with interest thereon from the date expended at
the Default Rate for Domestic Rate Loans constituting Revolving Advances shall
be paid upon demand by Borrower, and until paid shall be added to and become a
part of the Obligations secured by the Liens created by the terms of this
Agreement or any other agreement between Agent, any Lender and Borrower.

            (g) Promptly upon the written request of Agent from time to time,
Borrower shall provide Agent, at Borrower's expense, with an environmental site
assessment or environmental audit report prepared by an environmental
engineering firm acceptable in the reasonable opinion of Agent, to assess with a
reasonable degree of certainty the existence of a Hazardous Discharge and the
potential costs in connection with abatement, cleanup and removal of any
Hazardous Substances found on, under, at or within the Real Property. Any report
or investigation of such Hazardous Discharge proposed and acceptable to an
appropriate Authority that is charged to oversee the clean-up of such Hazardous
Discharge shall be acceptable to Agent. If such estimates, individually or in
the aggregate, exceed $100,000, Agent shall have the right to require Borrower
to post a bond, letter of credit or other security reasonably satisfactory to
Agent to secure payment of these costs and expenses.

            (h) Borrower shall defend and indemnify Agent and Lenders and hold
Agent, Lenders and their respective employees, agents, directors and officers
harmless from and against all loss, liability, damage and expense, claims,
costs, fines and penalties, including attorney's fees, suffered or incurred by
Agent or Lenders under or on account of any Environmental Laws, including the
assertion of any Lien thereunder, with respect to any Hazardous Discharge, the
presence of any Hazardous Substances affecting the Real Property, whether or not
the same originates or emerges from the Real Property or any contiguous real
estate, including any loss of value of the Real Property as a result of the
foregoing except to the extent such loss, liability, damage and expense is
attributable to any Hazardous Discharge resulting from actions on the part of
Agent or any Lender. Borrower's obligations under this Section 4.19 shall arise
upon the discovery of the presence of any Hazardous Substances at the Real
Property, whether or not any federal, state, or local environmental agency has
taken or threatened any action in connection with the presence of any Hazardous
Substances. Borrower's obligation and the indemnifications hereunder shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

            (i) For purposes of Section 4.19 and 5.7, all references to Real
Property shall be deemed to include all of Borrower's right, title and interest
in and to its owned and leased premises.

       4.20 Financing Statements. Except as respects the financing statements
filed by Agent and the financing statements evidencing the security interests
described on Schedule 1.2, no financing statement covering any of the Collateral
or any proceeds thereof is on file in any public office.

XI.    LENDERS' RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT.

       11.1  Rights and Remedies.

             (a) Upon the occurrence of (i) an Event of Default pursuant to
Section 10.7 all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and this
Agreement and the obligation of Lenders to make Advances shall be deemed
terminated; and, (ii) any of the other Events of Default and at any time
thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), at the option of
Required Lenders all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and
Lenders shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to terminate the
obligation of Lenders to make Advances. Upon the occurrence of any Event of

                                      -77-
<PAGE>

Default, Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all rights and remedies
provided for herein, under the Other Documents, under the Uniform Commercial
Code and at law or equity generally, including the right to foreclose the
security interests granted herein and to realize upon any Collateral by any
available judicial procedure and/or to take possession of and sell any or all of
the Collateral with or without judicial process. Agent may enter any of
Borrower's premises or other premises without legal process and without
incurring liability to Borrower therefor, and Agent may thereupon, or at any
time thereafter, in its discretion without notice or demand, take the Collateral
and remove the same to such place as Agent may deem advisable and Agent may
require Borrower to make the Collateral available to Agent at a convenient
place. With or without having the Collateral at the time or place of sale, Agent
may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, at any
time or place, in one or more sales, at such price or prices, and upon such
terms, either for cash, credit or future delivery, as Agent may elect. Except as
to that part of the Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline
speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Agent
shall give Borrower reasonable notification of such sale or sales, it being
agreed that in all events written notice mailed to Borrower at least ten (10)
days prior to such sale or sales is reasonable notification. At any public sale
Agent or any Lender may bid for and become the purchaser, and Agent, any Lender
or any other purchaser at any such sale thereafter shall hold the Collateral
sold absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any
equity of redemption and all such claims, rights and equities are hereby
expressly waived and released by Borrower. In connection with the exercise of
the foregoing remedies, including the sale of Inventory, Agent is granted a
perpetual nonrevocable, royalty free, nonexclusive license and Agent is granted
permission to use all of Borrower's (a) trademarks, trade styles, trade names,
patents, patent applications, copyrights, service marks, licenses, franchises
and other proprietary rights which are used or useful in connection with
Inventory for the purpose of marketing, advertising for sale and selling or
otherwise disposing of such Inventory and (b) Equipment for the purpose of
completing the manufacture of unfinished goods. The cash proceeds realized from
the sale of any Collateral shall be applied to the Obligations in the order set
forth in Section 11.5 hereof. Noncash proceeds will only be applied to the
Obligations as they are converted into cash. If any deficiency shall arise,
Borrower shall remain liable to Agent and Lenders therefor.

            (b) To the extent that Applicable Law imposes duties on the Agent to
exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for the Agent (i) to fail to
incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Agent to prepare Collateral
for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into
finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (ii) to fail to
obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to
obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third
party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected
or disposed of, (iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Customers
or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse
claims against Collateral, (iv) to exercise collection remedies against
Customers and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use
of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (v) to advertise
dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation,
whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vi) to contact other

                                      -78-
<PAGE>

Persons, whether or not in the same business as the Borrower, for expressions of
interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (vii) to hire one
or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral,
whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (viii) to dispose of
Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of
the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of
doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (ix) to dispose of assets
in wholesale rather than retail markets, (x) to disclaim disposition warranties,
such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (xi) to purchase insurance or
credit enhancements to insure the Agent against risks of loss, collection or
disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Agent a guaranteed return from
the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (xii) to the extent deemed
appropriate by the Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment
bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist the Agent in the
collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Borrower acknowledges that
the purpose of this Section 11.1(b) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of
what actions or omissions by the Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in
the Agent's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions
or omissions by the Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely
on account of not being indicated in this Section 11.1(b). Without limitation
upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 11.1(b) shall be construed
to grant any rights to Borrower or to impose any duties on Agent that would not
have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by Applicable Law in the
absence of this Section 11.1(b).

       11.2 Agent's Discretion. Agent shall have the right in its sole
discretion to determine which rights, Liens, security interests or remedies
Agent may at any time pursue, relinquish, subordinate, or modify or to take any
other action with respect thereto and such determination will not in any way
modify or affect any of Agent's or Lenders' rights hereunder.

       11.3 Setoff. Subject to Section 14.12, in addition to any other rights
which Agent or any Lender may have under Applicable Law, upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default hereunder, Agent and such Lender shall have a right,
immediately and without notice of any kind, to apply Borrower's property held by
Agent and such Lender to reduce the Obligations.

       11.4 Rights and Remedies not Exclusive. The enumeration of the foregoing
rights and remedies is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any
rights or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedies
provided for herein or otherwise provided by law, all of which shall be
cumulative and not alternative.

       11.5 Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received
by the Agent on account of the Obligations or any other amounts outstanding
under any of the Other Documents or in respect of the Collateral may, at Agent's
discretion, be paid over or delivered as follows:

       FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Agent in connection with
enforcing its rights and the rights of the Lenders under this Agreement and the
Other Documents and any protective advances made by the Agent with respect to
the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of this Document;

                                      -79-

       SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent;

       THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in
connection with enforcing its rights under this Agreement and the Other
Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Lender;

       FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of accrued
fees and interest;

       FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the
Obligations (including the payment or cash collateralization of any outstanding

       SIXTH, to all other Obligations and other obligations which shall have
become due and payable under the Other Documents or otherwise and not repaid
pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and

       SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be
lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive (so long as it is
not a Defaulting Lender) an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the
proportion that the then outstanding Advances held by such Lender bears to the
aggregate then outstanding Advances) of amounts available to be applied pursuant
to clauses "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any
amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are
attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit,
such amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account and applied
(A) first, to reimburse the Issuer from time to time for any drawings under such
Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of
Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and
"SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 11.5.

of the Closing Date to and including the date immediately preceding the second
anniversary of the Closing Date.

       13.2 Termination. The termination of the Agreement shall not affect
Borrower's, Agent's or any Lender's rights, or any of the Obligations having
their inception prior to the effective date of such termination, and the
provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative until all transactions
entered into, rights or interests created or Obligations have been fully and
indefeasibly paid, disposed of, concluded or liquidated. The security interests,
Liens and rights granted to Agent and Lenders hereunder and the financing
statements filed hereunder shall continue in full force and effect,
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or the fact that Borrower's
Account may from time to time be temporarily in a zero or credit position, until
all of the Obligations of Borrower have been indefeasibly paid and performed in
full after the termination of this Agreement or Borrower has furnished Agent and
Lenders with an indemnification satisfactory to Agent and Lenders with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Borrower waives any rights which it may have under the
Uniform Commercial Code to demand the filing of termination statements with
respect to the Collateral, and Agent shall not be required to send such
termination statements to Borrower, or to file them with any filing office,
unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms and all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in immediately

                                      -81-
<PAGE>

available funds. All representations, warranties, covenants, waivers and
agreements contained herein shall survive termination hereof until all
Obligations are indefeasibly paid and performed in full.

XIV.   REGARDING AGENT.

       14.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates PNC to act as Agent for
such Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and the Other Documents and to exercise such powers
and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and Agent shall hold all Collateral,
payments of principal and interest, fees (except the fees set forth in Sections
3.3(a) and 3.4), charges and collections (without giving effect to any
collection days) received pursuant to this Agreement, for the ratable benefit of
Lenders. Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agents
or employees. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement
(including collection of the Note) Agent shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting)
upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be
binding; provided, however, that Agent shall not be required to take any action
which exposes Agent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or the
Other Documents or Applicable Law unless Agent is furnished with an
indemnification reasonably satisfactory to Agent with respect thereto.

       14.2 Nature of Duties. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Other Documents.
Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be
(i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in
connection herewith, unless caused by their gross (not mere) negligence or
willful misconduct, or (ii) responsible in any manner for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower or any officer
thereof contained in this Agreement, or in any of the Other Documents or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the
Other Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, due
execution, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the Other
Documents or for any failure of Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder.
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of Borrower. The duties of Agent as respects the
Advances to Borrower shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; Agent
shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect
of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
to or shall be so construed as to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect
of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein.

       14.3 Lack of Reliance on Agent and Resignation. Independently and without
reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue
to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of Borrower and each Guarantor in connection with the making and the

                                      -82-
<PAGE>

continuance of the Advances hereunder and the taking or not taking of any action
in connection herewith, and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of
Borrower and each Guarantor. Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession
before making of the Advances or at any time or times thereafter except as shall
be provided by Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof. Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, information,
representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document, certificate
or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any Other Document, or of the financial condition of Borrower or
any Guarantor, or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this
Agreement, the Note, the Other Documents or the financial condition of Borrower,
or the existence of any Event of Default or any Default.

       Agent may resign on sixty (60) days' written notice to each of Lenders
and Borrower and upon such resignation, the Required Lenders will promptly
designate a successor Agent reasonably satisfactory to Borrower.

       Any such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties
of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon
its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Agent. After any Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this
Article XIV shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

       14.4 Certain Rights of Agent. If Agent shall request instructions from
Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in
connection with this Agreement or any Other Document, Agent shall be entitled to
refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Agent shall have
received instructions from the Required Lenders; and Agent shall not incur
liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the
foregoing, Lenders shall not have any right of action whatsoever against Agent
as a result of its acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with
the instructions of the Required Lenders.

       14.5 Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement,
certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, order or other
document or telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity, and, with respect
to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the Other Documents and
its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. Agent may employ
agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for the default or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by Agent with
reasonable care.

       14.6 Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder or under
the Other Documents, unless Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrower
referring to this Agreement or the Other Documents, describing such Default or
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the

                                      -83-
<PAGE>

event that Agent receives such a notice, Agent shall give notice thereof to
Lenders. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, that,
unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the
best interests of Lenders.

       14.7 Indemnification. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed and
indemnified by Borrower, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify Agent in
proportion to its respective portion of the Advances (or, if no Advances are
outstanding, according to its Commitment Percentage), from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in performing its
duties hereunder, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any Other Document; provided that, Lenders shall not be liable for any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross
(not mere) negligence or willful misconduct.

       14.8 Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to the obligation of
Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Advances made by it shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing
the duties as Agent specified herein; and the term "Lender" or any similar term
shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Agent in its
individual capacity as a Lender. Agent may engage in business with Borrower as
if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement
or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.

       14.9 Delivery of Documents. To the extent Agent receives financial
statements required under Sections 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.12 and 9.13 or Borrowing
Base Certificates from Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement which
Borrower is not obligated to deliver to each Lender, Agent will promptly furnish
such documents and information to Lenders.

       14.10 Borrower's Undertaking to Agent. Without prejudice to its
obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, Borrower
hereby undertakes with Agent to pay to Agent from time to time on demand all
amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of Agent or
Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent not already
paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto satisfy the
relevant Borrower's obligations to make payments for the account of Lenders or
the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement.

       14.11 No Reliance on Agent's Customer Identification Program. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates,
participants or assignees, may rely on the Agent to carry out such Lender's,
Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or
other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act
or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR
103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the "CIP Regulations"), or any other
Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items
relating to or in connection with Borrower, its Affiliates or its agents, this

                                      -84-
<PAGE>

Agreement, the Other Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated
hereby: (1) any identity verification procedures, (2) any record-keeping, (3)
comparisons with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures
required under the CIP Regulations or such other laws.

       14.12 Other Agreements. Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not,
without the express consent of Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is
lawfully entitled to do so, upon the request of Agent, set off against the
Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to Borrower or any deposit
accounts of Borrower now or hereafter maintained with such Lender. Each of the
Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so
by Agent, take or cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of
any legal or equitable proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise
enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral the purpose of which is,
or could be, to give such Lender any preference or priority against the other
Lenders with respect to the Collateral.

XV.    MISCELLANEOUS.

       15.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applied to contracts to be
performed wholly within the State of New York. Any judicial proceeding brought
by or against Borrower with respect to any of the Obligations, this Agreement,
the Other Documents or any related agreement may be brought in any court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of New York, United States of America, and,
by execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrower accepts for itself and in
connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any
judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement. Borrower hereby
waives personal service of any and all process upon it and consents that all
such service of process may be made by registered mail (return receipt
requested) directed to Borrower at its address set forth in Section 15.6 and
service so made shall be deemed completed five (5) days after the same shall
have been so deposited in the mails of the United States of America. Nothing
herein shall affect the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law or
shall limit the right of Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against
Borrower in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Borrower waives any objection
to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not
assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum
non conveniens. Borrower waives the right to remove any judicial proceeding
brought against Borrower in any state court to any federal court. Any judicial
proceeding by Borrower against Agent or any Lender involving, directly or
indirectly, any matter or claim in any way arising out of, related to or
connected with this Agreement or any related agreement, shall be brought only in
a federal or state court located in the County of New York, State of New York.

       15.2 Entire Understanding.

            (a) This Agreement and the documents executed concurrently herewith
contain the entire understanding between Borrower, Agent and each Lender and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, if any, relating to the
subject matter hereof. Any promises, representations, warranties or guarantees
not herein contained and hereinafter made shall have no force and effect unless

                                      -85-
<PAGE>

in writing, signed by Borrower's, Agent's and each Lender's respective officers.
Neither this Agreement nor any portion or provisions hereof may be changed,
modified, amended, waived, supplemented, discharged, cancelled or terminated
orally or by any course of dealing, or in any manner other than by an agreement
in writing, signed by the party to be charged. Borrower acknowledges that it has
been advised by counsel in connection with the execution of this Agreement and
Other Documents and is not relying upon oral representations or statements
inconsistent with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

            (b) The Required Lenders, Agent with the consent in writing of the
Required Lenders, and Borrower may, subject to the provisions of this Section
15.2 (b), from time to time enter into written supplemental agreements to this
Agreement or the Other Documents executed by Borrower, for the purpose of adding
or deleting any provisions or otherwise changing, varying or waiving in any
manner the rights of Lenders, Agent or Borrower thereunder or the conditions,
provisions or terms thereof of waiving any Event of Default thereunder, but only
to the extent specified in such written agreements; provided, however, that no
such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of all Lenders:

                (i)   increase the Commitment Percentage, the maximum dollar
       commitment of any Lender or the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount.

                (ii)  extend the maturity of any Note or the due date for any
       amount payable hereunder, or decrease the rate of interest or reduce any
       fee payable by Borrower to Lenders pursuant to this Agreement.

                (iii) alter the definition of the term Required Lenders or
       alter, amend or modify this Section 15.2(b).

                (iv)  release any Collateral during any calendar year (other
       than in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) having an
       aggregate value in excess of $250,000.

                (v)   change the rights and duties of Agent.

                (vi)  permit any Revolving Advance to be made if after giving
       effect thereto the total of Revolving Advances outstanding hereunder
       would exceed the Formula Amount for more than sixty (30) consecutive
       Business Days or exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the Formula
       Amount.

                (vii) increase the Advance Rates above the Advance Rates in
       effect on the Closing Date.

                (viii) release any Guarantor.

Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each Lender and shall be
binding upon Borrower, Lenders and Agent and all future holders of the
Obligations. In the case of any waiver, Borrower, Agent and Lenders shall be
restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of Default waived
shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of a specific
Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default (whether or not

                                      -86-
<PAGE>


the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of Default which was
waived), or impair any right consequent thereon.

       In the event that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to
this Section 15.2 and such Lender shall not respond or reply to Agent in writing
within five (5) days of delivery of such request, such Lender shall be deemed to
have consented to the matter that was the subject of the request. In the event
that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this Section 15.2 and
such consent is denied, then PNC may, at its option, require such Lender to
assign its interest in the Advances to PNC or to another Lender or to any other
Person designated by the Agent (the "Designated Lender"), for a price equal to
the then outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
and fees due such Lender, which interest and fees shall be paid when collected
from Borrower. In the event PNC elects to require any Lender to assign its
interest to PNC or to the Designated Lender, PNC will so notify such Lender in
writing within forty five (45) days following such Lender's denial, and such
Lender will assign its interest to PNC or the Designated Lender no later than
five (5) days following receipt of such notice pursuant to a Commitment Transfer
Supplement executed by such Lender, PNC or the Designated Lender, as
appropriate, and Agent.

       Notwithstanding (a) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default,
(b) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section
8.2 hereof have not been satisfied or (c) any other provision of this Agreement,
Agent may at its discretion and without the consent of the Required Lenders,
voluntarily permit the outstanding Revolving Advances at any time to exceed the
Formula Amount by up to ten percent (10%) of the Formula Amount for up to thirty
(30) consecutive Business Days (the "Out-of-Formula Loans"). If Agent is willing
in its sole and absolute discretion to make such Out-of-Formula Loans, such
Out-of-Formula Loans shall be payable on demand and shall bear interest at the
Default Rate for Revolving Advances consisting of Domestic Rate Loans; provided
that, if Lenders do make Out-of-Formula Loans, neither Agent nor Lenders shall
be deemed thereby to have changed the limits of Section 2.1(a). For purposes of
this paragraph, the discretion granted to Agent hereunder shall not preclude
involuntary overadvances that may result from time to time due to the fact that
the Formula Amount was unintentionally exceeded for any reason, including, but
not limited to, Collateral previously deemed to be either "Eligible Receivables"
or "Eligible Inventory", as applicable, becomes ineligible, collections of
Receivables applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances are thereafter
returned for insufficient funds or overadvances are made to protect or preserve
the Collateral. In the event Agent involuntarily permits the outstanding
Revolving Advances to exceed the Formula Amount by more than ten percent (10%),
Agent shall use its efforts to have Borrower decrease such excess in as
expeditious a manner as is practicable under the circumstances and not
inconsistent with the reason for such excess. Revolving Advances made after
Agent has determined the existence of involuntary overadvances shall be deemed
to be involuntary overadvances and shall be decreased in accordance with the
preceding sentence.

       In addition to (and not in substitution of) the discretionary Revolving
Advances permitted above in this Section 15.2, the Agent is hereby authorized by
Borrower and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole discretion, (A)
after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event of
Default, or (B) at any time that any of the other applicable conditions
precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied, to make
Revolving Advances to Borrower on behalf of the Lenders which the Agent, in its
reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (a) to preserve or

                                      -87-
<PAGE>

protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (b) to enhance the likelihood
of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Advances and other Obligations,
or (c) to pay any other amount chargeable to Borrower pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement; provided, that at any time after giving effect to any such
Revolving Advances the outstanding Revolving Advances do not exceed one hundred
ten percent (110%) of the Formula Amount.

       15.3 Successors and Assigns; Participations; New Lenders.

            (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Borrower, Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the Obligations and their
respective successors and assigns, except that Borrower may not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Agent and each Lender.

            (b) Borrower acknowledges that in the regular course of commercial
banking business one or more Lenders may at any time and from time to time sell
participating interests in the Advances to other financial institutions (each
such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a "Participant"). Each
Participant may exercise all rights of payment (including rights of set-off)
with respect to the portion of such Advances held by it or other Obligations
payable hereunder as fully as if such Participant were the direct holder thereof
provided that Borrower shall not be required to pay to any Participant more than
the amount which it would have been required to pay to Lender which granted an
interest in its Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to such
Participant had such Lender retained such interest in the Advances hereunder or
other Obligations payable hereunder and in no event shall Borrower be required
to pay any such amount arising from the same circumstances and with respect to
the same Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to both such Lender and
such Participant. Borrower hereby grants to any Participant a continuing
security interest in any deposits, moneys or other property actually or
constructively held by such Participant as security for the Participant's
interest in the Advances.

            (c) Any Lender may with the consent of Agent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed sell, assign or transfer all or any part of its
rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents to one or more additional
banks or financial institutions and one or more additional banks or financial
institutions may commit to make Advances hereunder (each a "Purchasing Lender",
and together with each Participant, each a "Transferee" and collectively the
"Transferees"), in minimum amounts of not less than $7,500,000 (provided that if
the transferor Lender is not transferring all of its rights, it shall retain at
least $7,500,000), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by a
Purchasing Lender, the transferor Lender, and Agent and delivered to Agent for
recording. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with a Commitment Percentage as
set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the
extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer Supplement creating a
novation for that purpose. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed
to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to
reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of

                                      -89-
<PAGE>

the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender
of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender
under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Borrower hereby consents to the
addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the
Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of
all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under
this Agreement and the Other Documents. Borrower shall execute and deliver such
further documents and do such further acts and things in order to effectuate the
foregoing.

            (d) Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment
Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender and the outstanding
principal, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees due hereunder. The entries
in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and
Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register as the owner of the Advance recorded therein for the purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or any
Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of $3,500 payable by the
applicable Purchasing Lender upon the effective date of each transfer or
assignment to such Purchasing Lender.

            (e) Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Transferee
and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such
Lender's possession concerning Borrower which has been delivered to such Lender
by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with
such Lender's credit evaluation of Borrower.

       15.4 Application of Payments. Agent shall have the continuing and
exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any payment and any and all
proceeds of Collateral to any portion of the Obligations. To the extent that
Borrower makes a payment or Agent or any Lender receives any payment or proceeds
of the Collateral for Borrower's benefit, which are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to
a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other party under
any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then, to such extent, the
Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Agent or such
Lender.

       15.5 Indemnity. Borrower shall indemnify Agent, each Lender and each of
their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, attorneys, employees and
agents from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever (including fees and disbursements of counsel) which
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Agent or any Lender in any
claim, litigation, proceeding or investigation instituted or conducted by any
Governmental Body or instrumentality or any other Person with respect to any
aspect of, or any transaction contemplated by, or referred to in, or any matter
related to, this Agreement or the Other Documents, whether or not Agent or any
Lender is a party thereto, except to the extent that any of the foregoing arises
out of the willful misconduct of the party being indemnified (as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, this indemnity shall extend to any
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,

                                      -89-
<PAGE>

costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including
fees and disbursements of counsel) asserted against or incurred by any of the
indemnitees described above in this Section 15.5 by any Person under any
Environmental Laws or similar laws by reason of Borrower's or any other Person's
failure to comply with laws applicable to solid or hazardous waste materials,
including Hazardous Substances and Hazardous Waste, or other Toxic Substances.
Additionally, if any taxes (excluding taxes imposed upon or measured solely by
the net income of Agent and Lenders, but including any intangibles taxes, stamp
tax, recording tax or franchise tax) shall be payable by Agent, Lenders or
Borrower on account of the execution or delivery of this Agreement, or the
execution, delivery, issuance or recording of any of the Other Documents, or the
creation or repayment of any of the Obligations hereunder, by reason of any
Applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, Borrower will pay (or will promptly
reimburse Agent and Lenders for payment of) all such taxes, including interest
and penalties thereon, and will indemnify and hold the indemnitees described
above in this Section 15.5 harmless from and against all liability in connection
therewith.

       15.6 Notice. Any notice or request hereunder may be given to Borrower or
to Agent or any Lender at their respective addresses set forth below or at such
other address as may hereafter be specified in a notice designated as a notice
of change of address under this Section. Any notice, request, demand, direction
or other communication (for purposes of this Section 15.6 only, a "Notice") to
be given to or made upon any party hereto under any provision of this Loan

       15.8 Severability. If any part of this Agreement is contrary to,
prohibited by, or deemed invalid under Applicable Laws or regulations, such
provision shall be inapplicable and deemed omitted to the extent so contrary,
prohibited or invalid, but the remainder hereof shall not be invalidated thereby
and shall be given effect so far as possible.

       15.9 Expenses. All costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys'
fees (including the allocated costs of in house counsel) and disbursements
incurred by Agent on its behalf or on behalf of Lenders and Lenders (a) in all
efforts made to enforce payment of any Obligation or effect collection of any
Collateral, or (b) in connection with the entering into, modification,
amendment, administration and enforcement of this Agreement and the agreements,
documents and instruments contemplated hereby, or any consents or waivers

fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement, or threatens to fail to perform, observe or discharge such
obligations or liabilities, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief

of proving that actual damages are not an adequate remedy.

       15.11 Damages. Neither Agent nor any Lender, nor any agent or attorney

Affiliates, outside auditors, counsel and other professional advisors, (b) to
Agent, any Lender or to any prospective Transferees, and (c) as required or
requested by any Governmental Body or representative thereof or pursuant to

terminated.

            (b) Borrower acknowledges that from time to time financial advisory,
investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to Borrower or
one or more of its Affiliates (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise)
by any Lender or by one or more Subsidiaries or Affiliates of such Lender and
Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to
such Lender by Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in
connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any
such Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender, it being understood that any such
Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Lender receiving such information shall be bound
by the provisions of this Section 15.15 as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such
authorization shall survive the repayment of the other Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the information subject
to this Section 15.15 shall not include, and the Agent and each Lender may
disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the
"tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of

and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided to Agent or such Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax

its sole and absolute discretion deem appropriate.

       15.17 Certifications From Banks and Participants; US Patriot Act. Each
Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated under the
Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and is not excepted
from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA Patriot
Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an affiliate of a
depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical presence in the
United States or foreign country, and (ii) subject to supervision by a banking
authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign bank)
shall deliver to the Agent the certification, or, if applicable,

other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the
