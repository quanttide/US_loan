right and, subject to Sections 2 and 5 hereof, shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition. The corporation may, by action of its board of
directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

corporation under Section 1 of this Article VI or advance of expenses under Section 5 of this Article VI shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon the written request of the director or officer. If a determination by the
corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI is required, and the corporation fails to respond within sixty (60) days to a written request for indemnity, the corporation shall be deemed to have
approved the request. If the corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advancing of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within thirty (30) days, the right to indemnification or
advances as granted by this Article VI shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person&#146;s costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification,
in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Business Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the
corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or it stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Business Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
