                 SMSC REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS

Hauppauge,  NY - December 20, 2004 - SMSC (Nasdaq:  SMSC) today  announced  that
revenues  for the third  quarter  ended  November  30, 2004 were $50.8  million,
compared to $72.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, and $50.2 million
in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding  intellectual property revenues,
the Company  reported  $48.0  million of product  sales for the third quarter of
fiscal 2005 versus $52.3 million in last year's third quarter, and $47.2 million
in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

The lower than  expected  revenues in the third  quarter  resulted from accounts
receivable  collectibility  concerns with a Taiwan-based  distributor  that have
just become apparent.  Generally  accepted  accounting  principles  preclude the
recognition of revenue in cases where  collectibility is not reasonably assured.
SMSC has concluded that this standard had not been met with respect to shipments
to this  distributor  that remained  uncollected at November 30, 2004. Had these
collectibility  concerns not arisen, SMSC would have reported an additional $4.2
million of product  revenues in the third  quarter of fiscal 2005.  In the event
that the distributor recovers its financial  stability,  SMSC will recognize the
appropriate  portions of the additional $4.2 million of revenues as payments are
received or if collectibility otherwise becomes reasonably assured.

Gross profit  percentage  on total  revenues was 45.9% for the third  quarter of
fiscal 2005,  compared to 58.3% in the  previous  year's  third  quarter.  Gross
profit  percentage  on  product  sales was 42.8% in this  year's  third  quarter
compared to 41.9% a year ago.

Research  and  development  expenses for the third  quarter were $10.4  million,
compared to $10.2  million in the year-ago  quarter,  and  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses were $13.0  million,  compared to $11.6 million in last
year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses includes
an expense provision of $0.8 million to mark Stock Appreciation Rights to market
as a result of the increase in SMSC's  share price in the quarter.  In addition,
litigation  costs were $0.9 million  higher than in the third  quarter of fiscal
2004.

The  provisions  for, or  benefits  from,  income  taxes in the  quarters  ended
November 30, 2004 and 2003 included tax benefits  related to prior years of $0.3
million and $0.8 million,  respectively.  These  benefits were  primarily due to
better than expected settlements of open tax audits.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $0.6  million,  or $0.03 per
share,  compared to $14.8 million,  or $0.77 per share,  in the third quarter of
fiscal  2004.  Net  income  included  $0.09 per  share and $0.66 per share  from
intellectual property revenues in the quarters ended November 30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Cash and liquid investments at November 30, 2004 were $180.9 million as compared
to $182.0  million at August 31, 2004.  Inventories at November 30, 2004 totaled
$38.0 million, up $10.2 million from August 31, 2004. This increase was a result
of the  replenishment  of buffer  stocks,  as well as  accelerated  purchases of
high-volume parts in response to apparent  shortages in the supply chain earlier
in the year.  SMSC estimates that  inventories  will be below $35 million by the
end of the fiscal year and should return to normal turnover levels by the end of
the first quarter of fiscal 2006.  The Company has no bank debt,  and book value
per share was $14.58 as of November 30, 2004.

"Exclusive of the potential distributor  collectibility issue, demand for SMSC's
PC I/O and non-PC I/O products grew sequentially.  This is encouraging following
a period of industry-wide  inventory  adjustment in SMSC's second quarter," said
Steven J. Bilodeau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Mr.  Bilodeau added,  "During the third quarter,  SMSC introduced the industry's
broadest line of USB2.0 hubs, USB2.0 card readers, mobile Super I/O and embedded
Ethernet  controllers  for consumer and  commercial  connectivity  applications.
Supported  by these  industry  first  and  second-generation  solutions,  we are
providing  designers of consumer  electronics  flexible,  low-cost ways to drive
performance enhancements and maximize the end user experience.

"The expansion of these product groups is in line with our commitment to further
diversify  our  business  in consumer  electronics  and  embedded  applications.
Looking ahead,  we expect to leverage the strength of a broad product  portfolio
into continued revenue growth."

Business Outlook:

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,  SMSC expects  revenues to be between $51
million and $55 million.  Gross profit  percentage is expected to be between 45%
and 46%.  Research and  development  expenses  are expected to be between  $10.5
million and $11.5 million, and selling,  general and administrative expenses are
expected to be between $11.5 million and $13.0 million. Amortization of acquired
intangibles is expected to be approximately $0.3 million. The effective tax rate
is estimated to be approximately 25%, and the Company expects fourth quarter net
income to be between $0.03 and $0.07 per share.

The  revenue  estimate  for the  quarter  excludes  approximately  $3 million of
revenue associated with expected  shipments of products by the  above-referenced
distributor to end customers. Those products were purchased from SMSC before the
current  collectibility  issue  became  apparent.  SMSC will not  recognize  any
revenue from those  products until payment  begins or  collectibility  otherwise
becomes  reasonably  assured.  If that  happens  before  the  end of the  fourth
quarter,  the revenue  expectation for that quarter could increase by up to $7.2
million,  representing the $3 million discussed in this projection plus the $4.2
million of revenue that could not be  recognized in the third  quarter.  If some
portion of the amount due is paid but  collectibility of the full amount owed to
SMSC does not become  reasonably  assured,  then an  appropriate  portion of the
potential $7.2 million of revenue would be recognized.

As of November 30, 2004, Other current assets included a $4.6 million receivable
from the above-referenced  distributor, of which $1.3 million has been recovered
subsequently. SMSC's current expectation is that the remaining $3.3 million will
be recovered.

Forward Looking Statements:

Except for historical  information  contained  herein,  the matters discussed in
this  announcement are  forward-looking  statements about expected future events
and financial and operating results that involve risks and uncertainties.  These
include the timely development and market acceptance of new products; the impact
of competitive  products and pricing; the effect of changing economic conditions
in domestic  and  international  markets;  changes in customer  order  patterns,
including loss of key customers,  order  cancellations or reduced bookings;  and
excess or obsolete  inventory  and  variations  in  inventory  valuation,  among
others.  Such  statements  are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks
and  uncertainties  surrounding  future  expectations  and may not  reflect  the
potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers or divestitures.

SMSC  competes  in the  semiconductor  industry,  which  has  historically  been
characterized  by intense  competition,  rapid  technological  change,  cyclical
market patterns,  price erosion and periods of mismatched  supply and demand. In
addition,  sales of many of the Company's  products  depend  largely on sales of
personal computers and peripheral devices,  and reductions in the rate of growth
of the PC, consumer  electronics and embedded markets could adversely affect its
operating  results.  SMSC  conducts  business  outside the United  States and is
subject to tariff and import  regulations and currency  fluctuations,  which may
have an effect on its business. All forward-looking  statements speak only as of
the date  hereof and are based upon the  information  available  to SMSC at this
time. Such information is subject to change, and the Company may not necessarily
inform,  or be required to inform,  investors of such  changes.  These and other
risks and uncertainties, including potential liability resulting from pending or
future litigation, are detailed from time to time in the Company's reports filed
with the SEC.  Investors are advised to read the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K and quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q filed with the  Securities and Exchange
Commission,  particularly those sections entitled "Other Factors That May Affect
Future  Operating  Results" for a more  complete  discussion  of these and other
risks and uncertainties.
