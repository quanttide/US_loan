         REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND AUTHORIZES AN ADDITIONAL
         STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO 533,700 SHARES
         ------------------------------------------------


Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. ESB Financial Corporation (Nasdaq:

authorized a repurchase program for the repurchase of up to
533,700 shares, or five percent, of the Company's outstanding
common stock.  The Company has completed its previously announced
repurchase program in the amount of 515,529 shares.

Repurchases are authorized to be made by the Company from time to
time in open-market or privately-negotiated transactions as, in

repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and may be
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's stock benefit
plans.

the Company, stated, "The ongoing repurchase program reflects
management's belief that the current price of the Company's
common stock does not adequately reflect the Company's long-term
business and earnings prospects.  The Company is fortunate to
have the financial flexibility that allows it to demonstrate its
commitment to and confidence in its future prospects."
