Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 16, 2004, the Edison International Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee approved
the award of long-term incentives for 2005 to executive officers of Edison International and its affiliates,
including its subsidiary Southern California Edison Company ("SCE").  As in recent years, these long-term
incentive awards will have two components, with Edison International nonqualified stock options comprising 75% of
the award value and Edison International performance shares comprising 25% of the award value.  A copy of the
Edison International 2005 Long-Term Incentives Terms and Conditions is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.  Such
information is incorporated herein by reference.

         On December 16, 2004 the Edison International and SCE Compensation and Executive Personnel Committees
approved target annual incentives for 2005 for executive officers under the Edison International Executive
Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  Under the Plan, annual incentive compensation is determined on the
basis of company, organizational and individual performance relative to corporate goals.  A copy of the goals for
2005, including the goals for SCE, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.  Such information is incorporated herein
by reference.  The SCE goals are subject to review and possible revision at the next regular SCE Board meeting
currently scheduled to occur in February 2005.

         Also, on December 16, 2004, the Edison International Board of Directors increased the annual director
match under Edison International's matching gifts program to up to $10,000 per calendar year to qualified
institutions, effective November 18, 2004.  Edison International's matching gifts program provides assistance to
qualified public and private schools by matching dollar-for-dollar gifts of at least $25 up to a prescribed
maximum amount per calendar year for employees of the Edison International companies and includes directors of
Edison International and SCE.
