<p>4.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joinders</b> - An individual or entity
seeking to join in a Court Filing (whether a Request for Relief, an Objection,
or a Reply thereto) may do so solely as an expression of support of such
Court Filing (each, a "Joinder").&nbsp; Without further order of the Court,
filing such Joinder does not entitle such individual or entity: (a) to
be an independent proponent of such Court Filing; (b) to independently
support or oppose the related Court Filings; (c) to independently settle
the Request for Relief that is the subject of such Court Filing; or (d)
to independently receive a ruling by the Court with respect to the Court
Filing. The Court may deem a Joinder to be a brief in support of the relevant
Court Filing, but (a) the Court will not consider any arguments or factual
allegations not contained in the relevant Court Filing, and (b) the Joinder
need not be separately responded to.
<p>5.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Entities Entitled to Service</b>
