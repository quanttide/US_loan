The Cash Amount of such Holders shall be paid from the following sources
in the following order of priority until satisfied: (A) first, from a distribution
of all Series 2001A Construction Fund Monies to all such Holders of Series

giving effect to the application of the Series 2001A Construction Fund

and Series 2001A-2 Bonds electing this option, shall receive (A) approximately
$48,666,000 in principal amount of New Securities (hereinafter defined)
to be distributed to Holders electing such option (the "<u>2001A-1 and
2001A-2 New Securities</u>") in an amount equal to sixty cents ($.60) in
New Securities for every one dollar ($1.00) of principal amount of the
Series 2001A-1 Unsecured Claim and the Series 2001A-2 Unsecured Claim elected
by such electing Holders; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that in no event
shall such New Securities, when added to the New Securities to be received
by Holders on account of the Series 2000A Unsecured Claim (hereinafter
defined) pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii) and Holders on account of the Remaining
Bonds Unsecured Claim (hereinafter defined) pursuant to Section 3(c)(ii),
have a value in excess of New Securities Value (hereinafter defined), <u>plus</u>
(B) a <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u> portion of the distribution to be received
through the Plan on account of such electing Holder's deficiency claim
with respect to the amount of Series 2001A Bonds for which that Holder
has made an Option B election after giving effect to the application of
such New Securities (the "<u>Electing Holders' Series 2001A Deficiency
Claim</u>"), which distributions under this subclause (B) shall be deposited
by United to the Pooling Agreement for reallocation and distribution pursuant
to the terms of Section 3(d); <u>provided</u>, <u>further</u>, that for
any Holder of Series 2001A-1 Bonds and Series 2001A-2 Bonds to elect this
Option B such Holder must tender to United a money order or cashier's check
in an amount sufficient to fund such Holder's pro rata allocation of the
Note Purchase upon allocation of the Note Purchase as set forth herein,
in return for which such Holder shall receive an aliquot amount of New
Securities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the event the total principal amount of Series 2001A Bonds elected to
be treated in Option B exceeds $81,110,000 (assuming that all other requirements
for valid and effective exercise shall have been satisfied) (in such event
a "<u>2001A Oversubscription</u>") the amount of the Series 2001A-1 and
Series 2001A-2 New Securities distributed to each such Holder electing
Option B shall be determined as follows.&nbsp; Each Holder electing Option
B shall receive a pro rata share of the 2001A-1 and 2001A-2 New Securities
determined by multiplying the 2001A-1 and 2001A-2 New Securities by a fraction,
the numerator of which will be the principal amount of Series 2001A Bonds
elected to be treated in Option B by that holder, and the denominator of
which shall be the total principal amount of 2001A Bonds elected to be
treated in Option B (for each such Holder the "<u>Oversubscription Allocation</u>").&nbsp;
In such event, each such Holder shall additionally be deemed to have elected
Option A for an amount that equals the principal amount of Series 2001A
Bonds owned by such Holder and initially elected to be treated in Option
B less a number that equals its Oversubscription Allocation divided by
..6.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the event that the total principal amount of Series 2001A Bonds elected
to be treated in Option B is lower than $81,110,000 (assuming that all
other requirements for valid and effective exercise shall have been satisfied)
(in such event the "<u>Series 2001A Undersubscription</u>"), any excess
principal amount of the 2001A-1 and 2001A-2 New Securities available, after
paying each Holder electing Option B an amount equal to 0.60 multiplied
by the principal amount of the Series 2001A Bonds elected to be treated
in Option B by such Holder (the "<u>Reallocated 2001A New Securities</u>"),
shall be transferred to the liquidating agent under the Pooling Agreement.&nbsp;
The liquidating agent shall liquidate the Reallocated 2001A New Securities
and distribute the proceeds pursuant to the terms of the Pooling Agreement.

elect Option B on its ballot accepting or rejecting the Plan or to tender
its pro rata allocation of the Note Purchase shall be deemed to elect Option
A.</dir>

<dir>

to the Trustees of and for the benefit of Holders of the Series 2001A-1

The breach by any Party of any of the provisions set forth in this paragraph
or in the Pooling Agreement shall not relieve any Party of their obligations
under this Agreement or subject United to any liability, cost or expense.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties hereto
acknowledge that there is no assurance that the proceeds of the assets
in the Pooling Agreement will be sufficient to permit the distribution
to the Holders electing Option A of the Series 2001A-1 Bonds and the Series

an order approving the Pooling Agreement and finding that the securities
in the Pooling Agreement, and all sales of such securities by the trustee
under the Pooling Agreement, shall be exempt from registration under Section
1145 of the Bankruptcy Code.&nbsp; If the Bankruptcy Court shall not have
issued an order approving the Pooling Agreement at or prior to the date
of the entry of an order on the adequacy of the disclosure statement relating
to the Plan, any Party may apply to the Bankruptcy Court to amend this
Agreement to provide for consideration equal to the value of the Pooling
Agreement Assets and liquidated for distribution to the Holders under this
Agreement.&nbsp; In such event, such substituted consideration shall be
distributed in accordance with this Agreement as if such assets were the
Pooling Agreement Assets.&nbsp; The inability to obtain approval of the
exemption as aforesaid, for reasons other than the failure by United to
exercise its commercially reasonable efforts, shall not relieve any Trustee
or Holder of its obligations under this Agreement or revive any of the
claims that were or could have been asserted against United in any of the
matters otherwise settled or compromised hereby.&nbsp; Provided that United
shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval of the
Pooling Agreement and the exemption as aforesaid, United shall have no
liability for, and the Trustees and the Designated Holders hereby waive
and the other Holders, upon the entry of the Settlement Order, shall be

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>New Securities</u>.&nbsp; Subject to the
entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Settlement Order approving this Agreement
as provided in Section 5 and subject to United's rights under Section 4(b),
United shall, in conjunction with the confirmation of the Debtors' Plan,
cause the issuance of convertible debt of the reorganized UAL Corporation
(the "<u>New Securities</u>") having a par value of $149,646,114 (the "<u>New
Securities Value</u>") and otherwise on terms developed by United and reasonably
acceptable to Stark, but in any event on terms sufficient to ensure that
the New Securities will trade, at the time of issuance, at a value not
less than par.&nbsp; The Trustees shall receive that portion of the New
Securities having a par value equal to $144,453,000 in the form of distributions
under the Plan in accordance with Sections 3(a)(ii), (b)(ii), and (c)(ii)
of this Agreement which shall be deemed to constitute a portion of the
Settlement Consideration.&nbsp; In addition, on the Effective Date of the
Plan, the electing Holders shall purchase the remaining portion of the
New Securities having a par value equal to $5,193,114 for a cash purchase
price equal to $5,193,114 pursuant to a note purchase agreement reasonably
acceptable to United and Stark (the "<u>Note Purchase</u>").&nbsp; The
entire $5,193,114 in proceeds derived by United from the Note Purchase
shall be deposited with the Trustees for Holders of the Series 2001A-1
Bonds and Series 2001A-2 Bonds as though there were only one series and
shall be used to fund the amounts due to the Holders of the Series 2001A-1
Bonds and the Series 2001A-2 Bonds as provided in Section 3(a)(ii) of this
Agreement and shall be deemed to constitute a portion of the Settlement
Consideration.&nbsp; This Agreement shall not impair the rights of third-parties
to assert, in connection with confirmation of the Debtors' Plan, that the
actual value of the New Securities exceeds the New Securities Value and
should be reduced accordingly.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Safety Valve</u>.&nbsp; If, in United's
judgment, the provisions of Section 4(a) of this Agreement relating to
the issuance of the New Securities are impairing, hindering, or delaying
United's ability to obtain exit financing, including any debt- or equity-based
component thereof, then United, in its sole discretion may, by written
notice thereof to the Designated Holders and the Trustees, elect to modify
the terms of the New Securities so as to eliminate any features thereof
which relate to convertibility of the New Securities into common or preferred
stock in the reorganized UAL Corporation; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that the par value of the New Securities, as modified pursuant to the preceding
clause, shall be equal to the New Securities Value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the
foregoing, United shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
in the Settlement Order a finding that the Trustees have acted consistent
with their duties and responsibilities under, and entry of the Settlement
Order does not violate, the terms of their respective Bond Agreements.&nbsp;

otherwise settled or compromised hereby.&nbsp; Provided that United shall
have used its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such finding in
the Settlement Order as aforesaid, United shall have no liability for,

set forth herein, the City has no right to enforce any remedy that it may
have or purport to have under Section 27.08 or any other provision of the
Airport Use Agreement on account of, or arising or resulting from any non-payment
or non-performance by United on or in any manner related to the Bonds.&nbsp;
The inability to obtain any such finding shall not relieve United of its
obligations under this Agreement or revive any claims that were or could
have been asserted against the Trustees or the Holders in any of the matters
otherwise settled or compromised hereby.&nbsp; Provided that the Trustees
and the Designated Holders shall have used their commercially reasonable
efforts to support United's efforts to obtain such finding in the Settlement
Order as aforesaid, neither the Trustees nor the Designated Holders shall
have any liability for, and United hereby waives any right to assert any

of, any failure to obtain such finding.

made in Section 10 hereof, it may withdraw from this Agreement as to the

the condition subsequent contained in Paragraph 15 of the Settlement Order
is not fulfilled (if applicable), then this Agreement shall automatically

Agreement shall be null and void, all Parties shall be released of their
obligations hereunder, and all waivers and releases provided herein shall
be null and void as of the date of such termination, except to the extent

waive and the other Holders, upon entry of the Settlement Order, shall
be deemed to have waived, any right to assert any claim against United
on account of, the inability to obtain the entry of such Settlement Order.
