(NASDAQ:  ADAT) announced today initial steps towards strengthening its ability to develop and offer targeted solutions based on its core technology capabilities related to electronic postmarking. Under the guidance of
Authentidate&#146;s new Chief Executive Officer, Suren Pai, the Company recently completed a review of all of its critical technical and product development processes. As a result, AuthentiDate has consolidated all product development activity related to electronic postmarking into a newly created Products &amp; Technology organization. This group will be responsible for establishing and developing a common electronic postmarking service platform architecture
designed to support a variety of vertical solutions and applications. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Suren Pai, Chief Executive Officer, stated &#147;We believe a strategy of selling targeted solutions is the most effective approach to commercialize our core offering. It is therefore a high priority for us to make it highly efficient and cost-effective, for our internal development teams as well as our business partners, to rapidly develop solutions that embed electronic postmarking services in a wide range of server- and web-based business solutions&#148;.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">AuthentiDate also announced that O&#146;Connell (Ben) Benjamin will be joining the Company to lead the Products &amp; Technology Group, effective January 1, 2005.

At Lucent, as Vice President in the wireless business unit, he served in various roles leading product management and customer technical support activities. Later, he joined Lucent
Digital Radio to lead the development and commercialization of its wireless audio and data platform. Following its merger into Ibiquity Digital Corporation he continued to serve the Company as its Co-COO until August 2003.
