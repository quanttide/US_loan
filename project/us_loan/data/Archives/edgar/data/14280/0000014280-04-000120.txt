Item 3.01: Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule of
Standard

On December 15, 2004, Media Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") received a
letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that the NASDAQ staff was
reviewing the Company's eligibility for continued listing on The NASDAQ SmallCap
Market. In particular, the staff indicated that the Company should have obtained
shareholder approval prior to issuing certain options to two directors and a
consultant, in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(A). The staff
also cited the Company for not filing a Listing of Additional Shares
Notification Form ("LAS Form") for the option issuances, as required by
Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(17). In response to the letter from NASDAQ, the Company
restructured the option issuances so as to demonstrate compliance with the
NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. In addition, the Company filed the necessary LAS Form
with NASDAQ on December 17, 2004. On December 20, 2004, the Company received a
second letter from NASDAQ indicating that the staff had determined that the
Company has regained compliance with the above mentioned NASDAQ Marketplace
Rules and that the matter has been closed. As a result, the Company will
continue to be listed on The NASDAQ SmallCap Market.
