SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS

Item 8.01  Other Events

     Mr.  Hadley  has been  serving  as the  president  of the  Company  under a
contract  for a salary of  $60,000  plus a bonus of  $25,000 in each of the four
calendar  quarters for the last two years. All  transactions  between Mr. Hadley
and the  Company  have been  reported in filings  made by the  Company  with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Mr. Hadley has accrued  $125,000 in unpaid
salaries  over the last two years and this salary shall be paid before  December
31,  2004.  Therefore,  on December  13, 2004 a meeting was held by the Board of
Directors in which it was resolved that  2,470,000  shares of restricted  common
stock shall be paid to Mr. Hadley as compensation for the unpaid salary.

     Dr.  Steven  J.  Robbins,   Acting  Chief  Executive   Officer  of  Cryptic
Afflictions, LLC, and David L. Hadley, President of Global Medical Technologies,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, have formed a new Nevada company
known as Limina  Biotechnologies, Inc.  Mr. Hadley and Dr. Robbins announce that
they seek to obtain  approval  from  their  respective  companies  to merge both
Cryptic  Afflictions,  LLC, and Global Medical  Technologies,  Inc., into Limina
Biotechnologies, Inc.

     Cryptic  Afflictions,  LLC, has extensive  U.S. and  international  patents
pending and owns the  intellectual  property rights to a major and,  heretofore,
unrecognized  human   europathogen,   a  RNA  virus  designated  -  Cryptovirus.
Substantial  clinical  and  molecular  evidence  indicates  that  this  virus is
involved in the development of major neurological  disorders  including Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) and  Idiopathic Epilepsy  (IE;  epilepsy of unknown cause).  This
evidence  includes (1) the presence of  Cryptovirus-specific  antibodies  in the
serum and cerebrospinal  fluid of patients  suffering from these disorders,  (2)
the   ability   of  the  virus  to  cause   virtually   identical   disease   in


                                        6
<PAGE>

experimentally-infected  animals and (3) nucleotide sequence data that indicates
that the virus is pandemic and  represents a single virus  "species" - more akin
to measles than  hypervariable  viruses like HIV.  Further  clinical  validation
studies using Cryptovirus-specific  RT-PCR assays have been initiated to confirm
the presence of the virus within the central  nervous system lesions of patients
diagnosed with such disorders.

     Global Medical  Technologies,  Inc., an  international  marketer of new and
refurbished  medical  equipment,  has  letters of intent to merge with six other
medical  equipment sales companies  within the states of California and Arizona.
These mergers,  should they be  consummated  and there is no assurance they will
be, could raise Global Medical Technologies,  Inc.'s, sales significantly, which
its  management  estimates  to be in the  range  of 300% if all  mergers  become
consummated. The Company is currently preparing a private offering to attempt to
raise the funds required to facilitate these potential mergers.  There can be no
assurances that the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise the funds
for these potential mergers.
