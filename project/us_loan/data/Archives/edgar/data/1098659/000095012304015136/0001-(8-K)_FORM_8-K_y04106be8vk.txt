ITEM 1.01      ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         Mediacom Communications Corporation (the "Registrant") owns cable
systems through two principal subsidiaries, Mediacom LLC and Mediacom Broadband
LLC. As previously reported, in October 2004, the operating subsidiaries of
Mediacom LLC (through a borrowing group referred to as the Mediacom LLC Group)
entered into a credit agreement (the "LLC Credit Agreement") to obtain
extensions of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.150 billion (the
"LLC Credit Facility").

         The operating subsidiaries of Mediacom Broadband LLC (through a
borrowing group referred to as the Mediacom Broadband Group) have a bank credit
facility (the "Broadband Credit Facility") aggregating approximately $1.396
billion of current commitments, of which approximately $953 million was
outstanding as of December 17, 2004. The Broadband Credit Facility is scheduled
to expire in September 2010.

         On December 17, 2004, the operating subsidiaries of Mediacom Broadband
LLC amended the Broadband Credit Facility by entering into an amended and
restated credit agreement (the "Amendment") with each of the lenders of the
Broadband Credit Facility and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as the
Chase Manhattan Bank), as administrative agent for the lenders, which Amendment
primarily conformed its definitions and financial covenants to the definitions
and financial covenants of the LLC Credit Facility. In addition, the terms
relating to letter of credit, mandatory prepayment, representations and
warranties, negative covenants and events of default were conformed to the terms
of the LLC Credit Agreement.

         JPMorgan Chase Bank (the administrative agent of the Broadband Credit
Facility), several of the lenders of the Broadband Credit Facility or their
respective affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from
time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending and/or
commercial banking services for the Registrant and certain of its subsidiaries
and affiliates, for which service they have in the past received, and may in the
future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses.
