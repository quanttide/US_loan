      On December 1, 2004, ADVANCED PLANT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (the

Mazel Plant Pharmaceutical Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter "Mazel") to
sell to Mazel all its rights relating to or connected with developing,
manufacturing and distributing of three of its products, specifically its plant
based compositions designed to treat elevated cholesterol, a plant based
composition designed to treat leukemia and a plant based composition designed to
treat Alzheimer's disease (hereinafter "the Three Pharmaceutical Products"). The
Registrant retained the rights for distributing "LOCHOL" as a nutritional
supplement.

      Under the Agreement the Registrant transferred all Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") and other United States and foreign governmental drug
safety and efficacy approvals, approvals or licenses of any kind relating to the
Three Pharmaceutical Products, trademarks (either registered or at common),
service marks (either registered or at common), trade names, service names,
labels and copyrights, and all registrations and applications worldwide related
to these Three Pharmaceutical Products, and all technical processes,
compilations, formulations, formulas, recipes and/or other such information
related to or connected with the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging
or repackaging or selling of the Three Pharmaceutical Products which were owned
by the Registrant.

      Under the Agreement, the Registrant received seven million (7,000,000)
shares of common stock of Mazal simultaneously with the execution of the

Registrant. After the issuance of the shares to the Registrant, Mazal had
7,050,100 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Mazal is focused on the
FDA development, testing, manufacturing and selling of plant pharmaceutical

      In addition under the Agreement, the Registrant shall receive a royalty of
two cents ($0.02) for each bottle of the Three Pharmaceutical Products sold by
Mazel which shall be paid on a quarterly basis. Mazel further agreed to pay
