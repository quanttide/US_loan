<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section&nbsp;21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements regarding the Company's and its subsidiaries' and affiliates' expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, process
for sale of the Company, restructuring and financing plans, expected emergence from bankruptcy, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, capital expenditures, network upgrades, products and
services, competitive positions, growth opportunities, plans and objectives of management for future operations, as well as statements that include words such as "anticipate," "if," "believe," "plan,"
"estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "should," "will," and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and readers
must recognize that actual results may differ materially from the Company's expectations. The Company does not undertake a duty to update such forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Company's 2003 Form&nbsp;10-K and the Company's pending
bankruptcy proceeding, results of litigation against the Company and government investigations of the Company, the effects of government regulation including the actions of local cable franchising
authorities, the availability of financing, actions of the Company's competitors, results and impacts of the process to sell the Company or its assets, pricing and availability of programming,
equipment, supplies, and other inputs, the Company's ability to upgrade its network, technological developments, and changes in general economic conditions. Many of these factors are outside of the
Company's control. </FONT></P>
