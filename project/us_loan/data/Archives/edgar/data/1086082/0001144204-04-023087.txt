SECTION 1- REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS
ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

The disclosure set forth under Item 3.02 (Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities) is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

SECTION 3-SECURITIES AND TRADING MARKETS
ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

On December 27, 2004, Datigen.com, Inc. (the "Registrant") received an aggregate
of  $178,667  in cash  and  executed  subscription  agreements  from 31  persons
relating to the purchase of an aggregate of 35,733,400 shares of common stock at
a per share  purchase  price of $0.005 per share.  The form of the  subscription
agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.

There were no underwriters or  broker-dealers  involved in the private placement
and therefore no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid; the Registrant
received the full gross proceeds of the offering.  The shares of common stock of
the  Registrant  were offered and sold only to friends and family of the officer
of the  Registrant.  The shares were offered and issued pursuant to Regulation S
promulgated by the Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  The Registrant did not
make any offers in the United States,  each of the  purchasers  were outside the
United States and there were no selling efforts in the United States.

Amir Uziel,  the  President  and Chief  Executive  Officer and a director of the
Registrant,  purchased  1,500,000  shares of common stock in the  offering,  and
Robert Lubin, a director of the  Registrant,  purchased  50,000 shares of Common
Stock.

Of the gross proceeds received by the Registrant,  $120,000 was paid to Purisys,
Inc. in accordance with the terms of the binding Letter of Intent dated December
15, 2004. As previously  disclosed in the  Registrant's  Current  Report on Form
8-K,  filed with the Commission on December 17, 2004 (File No.  000-26027),  the
Registrant  entered into a binding  letter of intent with  Purisys,  Inc., a New
Jersey corporation,  and the sole shareholder of Purisys, which provides,  among
other things,  for the sale to the Registrant of all of the assets  constituting
the Battery Brain Product owned by Purisys.  The  disbursement  made on December
27, 2004 to Purisys of $120,000 was a condition of the Letter of Intent.  If the
Registrant  terminates  the  Letter  of  Intent  prior  to  the  closing  of the
contemplated  transaction,  said amount will be  automatically  converted into a
loan from the  Registrant  to  Purisys,  which will  become  due and  payable by
Purisys within 15 days after the date of termination of the Letter of Intent.

                              his  behalf  has  undertaken  or  carried  out any
                              activity   for  the  purpose  of,  or  that  could
                              reasonably  be  expected  to have the  effect  of,

                              territories or possessions, for any of the Shares.

                   9.   THE  UNDERSIGNED   CONSENTS  TO  THE  COMPANY  MAKING  A
                        NOTATION  ON ITS RECORDS OR GIVING  INSTRUCTIONS  TO ANY
                        TRANSFER  AGENT OF THE COMPANY IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE
                        RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF THE SHARES SET FORTH IN THIS
                        SECTION.

      (k) The undersigned is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in
Rule 501 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act by reason
of Rule 501(a)(3).


      (l) The  undersigned  understands  that an  investment  in the Shares is a
speculative  investment  which  involves a high degree of risk and the potential
loss of his entire investment.

      (m) The  undersigned's  overall  commitment to  investments  which are not
readily marketable is not  disproportionate  to the undersigned's net worth, and
an  investment  in the Shares will not cause such overall  commitment  to become
excessive.

      (n) The undersigned has received all documents,  records,  books and other
information  pertaining to the undersigned's  investment in the Company that has
been  requested by the  undersigned.  The  undersigned  has reviewed or received
copies  of all  reports  and  other  documents  filed  by the  Company  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC Documents").

      (o) The  undersigned  represents  and  warrants  to the  Company  that all
information that the undersigned has provided to the Company, including, without
limitation,  the  information in the Investor  Questionnaire  attached hereto or
previously  provided to the Company (the "Investor  Questionnaire"),  is correct
and complete as of the date hereof.

      (p) Other than as set forth herein,  the  undersigned  is not relying upon
any other information, representation or warranty by the Company or any officer,
director,  stockholder, agent or representative of the Company in determining to
invest in the  Shares.  The  undersigned  has  consulted,  to the extent  deemed
appropriate by the undersigned,  with the  undersigned's  own advisers as to the
financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in the Shares
and on that basis  believes that his or its investment in the Shares is suitable
and appropriate for the undersigned.

      (q) The  undersigned is aware that no federal or state agency has (i) made
any finding or determination  as to the fairness of this  investment,  (ii) made
any  recommendation  or  endorsement  of the  Shares  or the  Company,  or (iii)
guaranteed or insured any investment in the Shares or any investment made by the
Company.


                                       10
<PAGE>

      (r) The  undersigned  understands  that the  price of the  Shares  offered
hereby bear no  relation  to the assets,  book value or net worth of the Company
and  were  determined  arbitrarily  by  the  Company.  The  undersigned  further
understands  that there is a substantial  risk of further dilution on his or its
investment in the Company.

                                   SECTION 4.

      The Company represents and warrants to the undersigned as follows:

      4.1  Organization  of the  Company.  The  Company  is a  corporation  duly
organized and validly  existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Utah, and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being  conducted.  The Company is
duly  qualified as a foreign  corporation to do business and is in good standing
in every  jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted or property
owned by it makes such  qualification  necessary,  other than those in which the
failure so to qualify would not have a material  adverse effect on the business,
operations,  properties,  prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Company.

      4.2  Authority.  (a) The Company  has the  requisite  corporate  power and
authority to enter into and perform its obligations  under this Agreement and to
issue the  Shares;  (b) the  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement  by the
Company and the consummation by it of the transactions  contemplated  hereby and
thereby  have been duly  authorized  by all  necessary  corporate  action and no
further  consent or  authorization  of the Company or its Board of  Directors or
stockholders  is required;  and (c) this  Agreement  has been duly  executed and
delivered by the Company and  constitutes a valid and binding  obligation of the
Company  enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
such  enforceability  may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  or
similar laws relating to, or affecting  generally the enforcement of, creditors'
rights and remedies or by other equitable principles of general application.

      4.3 Capitalization. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of
the Company  consists of 50,000,000  shares of Common Stock,  of which as of the
date hereof 601,190 shares are issued and  outstanding.  All of such outstanding
shares have been, or upon issuance  will be,  validly  issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable.

      4.4 SEC Documents. To the best of Company's knowledge, the Company has not
provided to the undersigned any information  that,  according to applicable law,
rule or regulation, should have been disclosed publicly prior to the date hereof
by the  Company,  but which has not been so  disclosed.  As of their  respective
dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the  Securities  Act or the  Exchange  Act,  as the  case may be,  and  other
federal,  state and local laws,  rules and  regulations  applicable  to such SEC

                                       11
<PAGE>

Documents,  and none of the SEC Documents  contained  any untrue  statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated  therein
or  necessary  in  order  to  make  the  statements  therein,  in  light  of the
circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not  misleading.  The  financial
statements of the Company  included in the SEC  Documents  comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with applicable  accounting  requirements and
the published  rules and  regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
(the "SEC") or other applicable rules and regulations with respect thereto. Such
financial  statements have been prepared in accordance  with generally  accepted
accounting  principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except (a) as may be otherwise  indicated in such  financial  statements or the
notes thereto or (b) in the case of unaudited interim statements,  to the extent
they may not include  footnotes or may be condensed or summary  statements)  and
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company as
of the dates  thereof  and the  results  of  operations  and cash  flows for the
periods  then ended  (subject,  in the case of unaudited  statements,  to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

      4.5 Exemption from Registration; Valid Issuances. The sale and issuance of
the Shares, in accordance with the terms and on the bases of the representations
and warranties of the  undersigned  set forth herein,  may and shall be properly
issued by the Company to the undersigned pursuant to Section 4(2),  Regulation D
and/or any  applicable  state law. When issued and paid for as herein  provided,
the Shares  shall be duly and validly  issued,  fully paid,  and  nonassessable.
Neither the sales of the Shares  pursuant to, nor the Company's  performance  of
its  obligations  under,  this  Agreement  shall (a) result in the  creation  or
imposition of any liens,  charges,  claims or other encumbrances upon the Shares
or any of the assets of the  Company,  or (b) entitle  the other  holders of the
Common  Stock of the Company to  preemptive  or other  rights to subscribe to or
acquire the Common Stock or other  securities  of the Company.  The Shares shall
not subject the  undersigned  to personal  liability by reason of the  ownership
thereof.

      4.6 No General  Solicitation or Advertising in Regard to this Transaction.
Neither the Company nor any of its  affiliates  nor any person  acting on its or
their behalf (a) has conducted or will conduct any general solicitation (as that
term is used in Rule 502(c) of Regulation D) or general advertising with respect
to any of the  Shares,  or (b) made any  offers  or  sales  of any  security  or
solicited  any offers to buy any  security  under any  circumstances  that would
require registration of the Common Stock under the Securities Act.

      4.7  No  Conflicts.  The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  of  this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation the issuance of the Shares, do
not and will not (a) result in a violation of the  Certificate or By-Laws of the
Company or (b) conflict with, or constitute a material default (or an event that
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a material  default) under, or
give  to  others  any  rights  of   termination,   amendment,   acceleration  or
cancellation of, any material agreement,  indenture, instrument or any "lock-up"
or similar  provision  of any  underwriting  or similar  agreement  to which the


                                       12

Company is a party, or (c) result in a violation of any federal, state, local or
foreign law, rule, regulation,  order, judgment or decree (including federal and
state securities laws and  regulations)applicable to the Company or by which any
property  or  asset  of the  Company  is  bound  or  affected  (except  for such
conflicts, defaults, terminations, amendments, accelerations,  cancellations and
violations  as would  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations,  properties,  prospects or condition
(financial  or  otherwise)  of the  Company)  nor is the  Company  otherwise  in
violation  of,  conflict  with or in  default  under any of the  foregoing.  The
business  of the  Company  is not  being  conducted  in  violation  of any  law,
ordinance  or  regulation  of  any  governmental  entity,  except  for  possible
violations  that either  singly or in the  aggregate  do not and will not have a
material adverse effect on the business,  operations,  properties,  prospects or
condition  (financial or otherwise) of the Company.  The Company is not required
under  federal,  state or local law,  rule or  regulation to obtain any consent,
authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court or
governmental  agency in order for it to  execute,  deliver or perform any of its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  or  issue  and  sell  the  Common  Stock in
accordance  with the terms hereof (other than any SEC, NASD or state  securities
filings  that  may be  required  to be made  by the  Company  subsequent  to the
Closing,  any registration  statement that may be filed pursuant hereto, and any
shareholder  approval required by the rules applicable to companies whose common
stock  trades  on the Over The  Counter  Bulletin  Board);  provided  that,  for
purposes of the  representation  made in this sentence,  the Company is assuming
and relying upon the accuracy of the relevant  representations and agreements of
the undersigned herein.

      4.8  No  Undisclosed  Liabilities.  The  Company  has  no  liabilities  or
obligations  that are material,  individually or in the aggregate,  and that are
not disclosed in the SEC Documents or otherwise publicly  announced,  other than
those  incurred in the ordinary  course of the Company's  businesses  and which,
individually  or in the aggregate,  do not or would not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company.

      4.9 No Undisclosed  Events or Circumstances.  No event or circumstance has
occurred or exists with  respect to the Company or its  businesses,  properties,
prospects,  operations or financial condition,  that, under applicable law, rule
or regulation,  requires  public  disclosure or  announcement  prior to the date
hereof by the Company but which has not been so publicly  announced or disclosed
in the SEC Documents.

      4.10  No  Integrated  Offering.  Neither  the  Company,  nor  any  of  its
affiliates,  nor any  person  acting on its or their  behalf  has,  directly  or
indirectly,  made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to
buy any security,  other than pursuant to this  Agreement,  under  circumstances
that would require  registration  of the Common Stock under the Securities  Act,
other than the private  offering  which the Company is  conducting in the United
States contemporaneously with this offering.

SEC  Documents,  there are no  lawsuits  or  proceedings  pending or to the best
knowledge of the Company  threatened,  against the Company,  nor has the Company

operations,  properties,  prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Company.  Except as set forth in the SEC Documents,  no judgment,  order,  writ,
injunction  or decree or award has been  issued by or, so far as is known by the

at least  ten days  prior  to the  date  hereof  and  except  for  arm's  length

of business  upon terms no less  favorable  than the Company  could  obtain from
third parties, none of the officers,  directors,  or employees of the Company is
presently a party to any transaction with the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(other than for services as employees,  officers and  directors),  including any
contract,  agreement  or  other  arrangement  providing  for the  furnishing  of
services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from,
or  otherwise  requiring  payments  to or from  any  officer,  director  or such

transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  have not made, at any time, any
written or oral  communication  in connection with the offer or sale of the same
which contained any untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material  fact  necessary in order to make the  statements,  in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

C. VALUATIONS OF INVESTMENTS


The general rule for  determining the value of investments in order to ascertain
whether a person is a  qualified  purchaser  is that the value of the  aggregate
amount of investments owned and invested on a discretionary basis by such person
shall be their fair market  value on the most recent  practicable  date or their
cost. This general rule is subject to the following provisos:

1)    In the case of Commodity  Shares,  the amount of investments  shall be the
      value of the initial margin or option premium deposited in connection with
      such Commodity Shares; and

2)    In each case, there shall be deducted from the amount of investments owned
      by such person the following amounts:

      (i)   The amount of any outstanding  indebtedness  incurred to acquire the
            investments owned by such person.

      (ii)  A Family Company,  in addition to the amounts specified in paragraph
            (a)  above,  shall  have  deducted  from the  value  of such  Family
            Company's  investments any outstanding  indebtedness  incurred by an
            owner of the Family Company to acquire such investments.
