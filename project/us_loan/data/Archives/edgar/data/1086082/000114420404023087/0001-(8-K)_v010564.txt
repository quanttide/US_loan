SECTION 1- REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS
ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

The disclosure set forth under Item 3.02 (Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities) is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

SECTION 3-SECURITIES AND TRADING MARKETS
ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

On December 27, 2004, Datigen.com, Inc. (the "Registrant") received an aggregate
of  $178,667  in cash  and  executed  subscription  agreements  from 31  persons
relating to the purchase of an aggregate of 35,733,400 shares of common stock at
a per share  purchase  price of $0.005 per share.  The form of the  subscription
agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.

There were no underwriters or  broker-dealers  involved in the private placement
and therefore no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid; the Registrant
received the full gross proceeds of the offering.  The shares of common stock of
the  Registrant  were offered and sold only to friends and family of the officer
of the  Registrant.  The shares were offered and issued pursuant to Regulation S
promulgated by the Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  The Registrant did not
make any offers in the United States,  each of the  purchasers  were outside the
United States and there were no selling efforts in the United States.

Amir Uziel,  the  President  and Chief  Executive  Officer and a director of the
Registrant,  purchased  1,500,000  shares of common stock in the  offering,  and
Robert Lubin, a director of the  Registrant,  purchased  50,000 shares of Common
Stock.

Of the gross proceeds received by the Registrant,  $120,000 was paid to Purisys,
Inc. in accordance with the terms of the binding Letter of Intent dated December
15, 2004. As previously  disclosed in the  Registrant's  Current  Report on Form
8-K,  filed with the Commission on December 17, 2004 (File No.  000-26027),  the
Registrant  entered into a binding  letter of intent with  Purisys,  Inc., a New
Jersey corporation,  and the sole shareholder of Purisys, which provides,  among
other things,  for the sale to the Registrant of all of the assets  constituting
the Battery Brain Product owned by Purisys.  The  disbursement  made on December
27, 2004 to Purisys of $120,000 was a condition of the Letter of Intent.  If the
Registrant  terminates  the  Letter  of  Intent  prior  to  the  closing  of the
contemplated  transaction,  said amount will be  automatically  converted into a
loan from the  Registrant  to  Purisys,  which will  become  due and  payable by
Purisys within 15 days after the date of termination of the Letter of Intent.
