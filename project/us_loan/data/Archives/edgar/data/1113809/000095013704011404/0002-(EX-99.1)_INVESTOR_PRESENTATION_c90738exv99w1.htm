Superior Store Economic Model

Substantially all stores are profitable in the first 12 months of operation



In 2003, average store revenues for stores opened for the entire year were $1.6
million; net retail sales per gross square foot* expected to approximate $600 in
2004



Store selling, general and administrative expense includes marketing and
advertising expense of approximately 8% of total revenues and store payroll of
14% - 15% of total revenues



For stores opened in 2003, investment per store averaged $485,000 - including
cost of leasehold improvements (net of tenant allowances), fixtures and
equipment, inventory (net of trade payables), and pre-opening expenses.



Investment per store has decreased 19% from the average investment in
stores opened in 2002




Page 27

*Net retail sales per gross square foot represents net retail sales from stores open throughout the entire period
divided by the total gross square footage of such stores
