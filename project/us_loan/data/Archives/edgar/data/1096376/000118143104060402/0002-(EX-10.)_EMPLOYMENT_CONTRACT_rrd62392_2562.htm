<P>The term <B>&quot;<U>Change of Control</B></U>&quot; means:</P>

<P>(d) any reorganization, merger, consolidation, or similar transaction or series of transactions that results in the record holders of the voting stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions holding immediately following such transaction or series of transactions less than 50% of the outstanding shares of any of the voting securities (based upon voting power) of any one of the following: (1) the Company, (2) any entity which owns (directly or indirectly) the stock of the Company, (3) any entity with which the Company has merged, or (3) any entity that owns an entity with which the Company has merged.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" SIZE=3><LI>Parachute Payment</LI>


</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" SIZE=2><P>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Employee is a &quot;disqualified individual&quot; (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), and any severance benefit provided for in this Agreement, together with any other payments which Employee has the right to receive from the Company and its affiliates, would constitute a &quot;parachute payment&quot; (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then Severance Payment together with the Change of Control Payment provided hereunder shall be either: </P>


<P>(a) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such total amounts received by Employee will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three times the Employee's &quot;base amount&quot; (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts received by the Employee shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or </P>


<P>(b) paid in full, </P>


<P>whichever of (a) or (b) produces the better net after-tax position to the Employee (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any applicable income tax).  </P>


<P>The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the severance benefit is necessary shall be made initially by the Company in good faith.  If a reduced payment is made and through error or otherwise that payment, when aggregated with other payments from the Company (or its affiliates) used in determining if a &quot;parachute payment&quot; exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than three times the Employee's base amount, then the Employee shall immediately repay such excess to the Company upon notification that an overpayment has been made.</P>
