                IAC ANNOUNCES PLAN TO SEPARATE INTO TWO COMPANIES

           TRAVEL BUSINESSES TO BECOME PUBLIC COMPANY CALLED 'EXPEDIA'

NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 21, 2004 - IAC/InterActiveCorp announced today that its
Board of Directors has approved a plan to separate IAC into two publicly traded
companies:


      o  Expedia,  which will include the domestic and international  operations
         associated  with  Expedia.com,   Hotels.com,   Hotwire,  TravelNow.com,
         Activity World, HotelDiscount.com, Condosaver.com, AllLuxuryHotels.com,
         Anyway.com,  eLong, TV Travel Shop,  Expedia Corporate Travel,  Classic
         Custom Vacations, and TripAdvisor; and

      o  IAC,  which will  include the  domestic  and  international  operations
         associated  with  IAC's  Ticketing  business,  including  Ticketmaster,
         ReserveAmerica,   TicketWeb  and  MuseumTix.com;  Electronic  Retailing
         business,   including   HSN,   HSN.com,   HSE  24,   America's   Store,
         Improvements,  and 9Live; Financial Services and Real Estate, including
         LendingTree,  RealEstate.com,  GetSmart,  iNest, and Domania; Local and
         Media  Services,  including  Citysearch,  ServiceMagic,   Entertainment
         Publications,  and Evite;  Personals,  including  Match.com  and uDate;
         Teleservices,  including Precision Response Corporation, Access Direct,
         and Hancock Information Group; and Interval International.

IAC will retain the  Company's  VUE  securities,  outstanding  indebtedness  and
preferred  stock  obligations,  as well as  substantially  the  Company's  cash.
Expedia will be appropriately capitalized.

Barry Diller will remain as Chairman and CEO of IAC. Mr.  Diller will also serve
as Chairman of Expedia and its senior executive; and Dara Khosrowshahi,  who the
company previously  announced would become President and CEO of IAC Travel, will
serve as CEO of Expedia.  Victor Kaufman will remain as Vice Chairman of IAC and
will also serve as Vice Chairman of Expedia.


SEE IMPORTANT NOTES AT END OF RELEASE
<PAGE>

Related to this  announcement,  Mr.  Diller  released  a Letter to  Shareholders
(attached) outlining the background and rationale for this development.

The  transaction is anticipated  to take the form of a  reclassification  of IAC
shares,  with the  holders  of IAC stock  receiving  a  proportionate  amount of
Expedia stock in a tax-free transaction.

It is contemplated that outstanding IAC stock options and restricted stock units
held by IAC employees will be converted  into options or restricted  stock units
of the  company  (either  IAC or  Expedia)  with  which  each  employee  remains
following the transaction. Appropriate adjustments will be made to all awards so
that  pre-transaction  value  will  be  maintained   immediately  following  the
transaction. Mr. Diller's IAC stock options will be converted to options in both
IAC and Expedia,  with exercise prices adjusted on a proportional basis based on
the  relative  trading  value  of  each  company  following  the  close  of  the
transaction.  Mr. Kaufman's  outstanding  equity will be treated the same as Mr.
Diller's.

The transaction is subject to a number of conditions including final approval by
IAC's Board of Directors of transaction  specifics,  receipt of a tax opinion of
counsel and the filing and  effectiveness  of  registration  statements with the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  In  addition,  it is  expected  that IAC
stockholder  approval will be required.  The proposed spin-off is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2005.

IAC will audiocast a conference call with investors and analysts  discussing the
transaction on Tuesday,  December 21, 2004, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The
live audiocast is open to the public at HTTP://WWW.IAC.COM/INVESTORS.HTML.

    adjustments for items such as non-cash compensation related to Expedia
    employees that is currently recorded at IAC Corporate. Allocations and pro
    forma adjustments will be finalized and reported in future company filings.
    In addition, certain revenue amounts which were historically eliminated in
    consolidation will no longer be eliminated, such as revenues for services
    provided by PRC to Expedia. For this reason, the combined revenue presented
    for Expedia and IAC is slightly greater than the consolidated revenue
    presented in historical financial statements.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
This press release contains  "forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of
the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.  These  forward-looking
statements   include   statements   relating  to  IAC's  anticipated   financial
performance, business prospects, and similar matters, and/or statements preceded
by,   followed  by  or  that   include  the  words   "expects,"   "anticipates,"
"contemplates,"    "intends,"   "plans,"   or   similar    expressions.    These
forward-looking  statements are based on management's  current  expectations and
assumptions, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in
circumstances  that  are  difficult  to  predict.   Actual  results  may  differ
materially  from those  suggested  by the  forward-looking  statements  due to a
variety of factors, including the risks inherent in separating Expedia from IAC;
costs related to the proposed transaction;  changes in business,  political, and
economic conditions due to the threat of future terrorist activity or otherwise;
future regulatory and legislative actions and conditions affecting our operating
areas; actions and initiatives by current and potential competitors; the ability
to expand into and  successfully  operate in  international  markets,  and other
risks  described in IAC's filings with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission
(the "SEC).  Other  unknown or  unpredictable  factors also could have  material
adverse  effects  on  IAC's  and  Expedia's   future  results,   performance  or
achievements.  In light of these risks, uncertainties,  assumptions and factors,
the  forward-looking  events  discussed in this press release may not occur. You
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these  forward-looking  statements,
which speak only as of the date stated,  or if no date is stated, as of the date
of this press release.

IAC is not under any obligation  and does not intend to make publicly  available
any update or other revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained
in this press release to reflect  circumstances  existing after the date of this
press  release or to reflect the  occurrence of future events even if experience
or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by
those forward-looking statements will not be realized.


ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION
In connection with the proposed spin-off it is currently  expected that IAC will
file a proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC. Stockholders of IAC are urged to

                           [IAC/INTERACTIVECORP LOGO]


                             LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

This letter is intended to explain and give context to our  actions.  We believe
greater  value can be created in the  configuration  we announce  today than any
other,  and from this all else flows.  This is entirely an  elective...there  is
nothing else that pushed us, no  transaction,  no inherent  worry that led us to
take this course at this time.

In the nine years since the creation of IAC, we have  acquired and built a great
collection  of  businesses,   in  categories  comprising  the  lion's  share  of
interactive commerce, each business with its own compelling story of success and
growth.  In a way you  could say we are the  victims  of our own  success.  HSN,
Ticketmaster,  and Match.com,  for example,  have each grown very  substantially
since we acquired them. And, while still embryonic,  our Financial  Services and
Local   businesses   -  including   LendingTree,   RealEstate.com,   Citysearch,
ServiceMagic,  Entertainment  Publications,  and Evite -- are poised for similar
great growth.

One of our most compelling successes has been our travel business, which started
in 1999  with our small  acquisition  of Hotel  Reservations  Network  (now,  of
course,  Hotels.com),  followed  in 2001  by our  acquisition  of a  controlling
interest in Expedia when that business was a fraction of its current size. Those
businesses  have had tremendous  growth...to  the point where they now represent
over 50% of IAC's  earnings,  and dwarf  each of our other  operations.  Many of
those,  standing  on their  own,  have  real  import  and  significance  but are
considered irrelevant in the current construct.

The result of our success in travel, and its present overweighting,  is that IAC
is viewed by the world as a Travel Company. While anyone who doubts that we love
the travel business would be wrong,  we've come to discover that this perception
actually  hinders the ability of our company to grow,  both  outside  travel and
inside of it. Outside  travel,  it hinders growth  through  acquisition  because
non-travel  companies  generally don't want to accept what they view as a travel
stock. Inside travel, acquisition growth, already hindered without a pure travel
currency,  would amplify IAC's  imbalance,  making it even harder for us to grow
outside of travel.

For the company and our shareholders these are negative  consequences we want to
correct. We had hoped that our natural progress over time would ameliorate this,
but

<PAGE>

given the size of our travel business and the growth in travel we anticipate, we
can't count on our ability to 'balance'  IAC by our own hand in the near future,
either through acquisition or internally.

So I'm  convinced,  and our Board is  convinced,  that  separating  IAC into two
companies is the right course...

EXPEDIA will be large and growing,  the world's  leading  online travel  company
with the  mission  of  becoming  the  largest  provider  of travel in the world.
Expedia will generate significant cash and have its own security, enabling it to
participate  with  full   flexibility  in  the  ongoing   evolution  and  likely
consolidation in the travel category.

The online  travel  business has grown and matured since we entered it, with the
concomitant  attraction of strong competitors ... horizontal,  vertical, and the
new word 'meta.' This of course brings a variety of challenges, along with great
opportunities,  as the matrix of relationships among suppliers,  intermediaries,
distributors  and  consumers  works itself out. It requires  complete  focus and
nimbleness  to maneuver in this  environment,  along with the  flexibility  that
comes from a pure  currency.  In the new  configuration,  Expedia  will have the
chance to grow every which way, according only to the demands of the marketplace
it serves, without any of the gating concerns that are inherent in being part of
IAC. Our travel business, with the leadership positions it has built in the U.S.
and  internationally,  is  in  an  incredibly  strong  position  to  meet  these
substantial challenges and  opportunities...and it will be best served unleashed
and empowered as a stand-alone entity.

IAC, post-transaction,  will be a diversified interactive commerce company, with
a mix of established and embryonic businesses, united by a spirit of opportunism
and  entrepreneurship.   IAC  will  be  excellently  capitalized  and  perfectly
positioned not only to grow its existing businesses,  but to identify and pursue
young   or   underappreciated   interactive   companies   with   strong   growth
potential...something our history shows is one of our real attributes.

We don't  believe  the  interactive  revolution  is over,  to say the least;  we
believe  big  opportunities  will  continue to be  available  to  companies  and
management  teams able to spot real  potential for growth and seize it, and that
playing with one hand tied behind our back as the next phase of internet  growth
and convergence unfolds would be intolerable.

This transaction really is a simplifying event. Expedia will become a very
straightforward company post-transaction, and I believe in that configuration
its size and dominance will be much more positively seen than currently. For
IAC, our complexity would be reduced and our clarity as a balanced and
diversified interactive commerce company will come through - until of course, we
again happily find a business whose growth and dominance in a category far
outweighs all else, and then the entity and our shareholders are best served for
it to be set free.

                                                                               2
<PAGE>
At both IAC and  Expedia,  the result of the split will be closer  alignment  of
employee  performance  and shareholder  returns,  which we believe will energize
both sets of employees.

And at both IAC and  Expedia,  I  couldn't  be more  enthusiastic  about the key
leaders and their talents.  Dara  Khosrowshahi is perfectly suited to be the CEO
of Expedia the public company;  and he has a superb  collection of managers,  as
IAC has a similar group of great talent.

At both companies  we'll continue to take every advantage from the collection of
businesses  under each roof - people  movement;  exchanging  best  practices and
lessons  learned;  cost savings from strategic  sourcing and other  initiatives;
sharing traffic and other beneficial inter-company arrangements. We've made real
progress here since the buy-in of our public subsidiaries one and one-half years
ago...and  over time I have no doubt  that we'd see more and more  benefit  from
cross-company activities. In finalizing the split, we'll preserve, as much as we
practically  can,  the  benefits  of  the  interrelationships  between  the  IAC
businesses  and the  Expedia  businesses.  We do intend  to put in place  strong
commercial  relationships  between IAC and  Expedia,  and yes,  some of the easy
benefits of  operating  as one  enterprise  will be given up, but we believe the
advantages of separation far outweigh all else.

Another  benefit  of  the  transaction  is  that  our  current  and  prospective
shareholders  will get enhanced  visibility into both companies.  I imagine that
some  hearing  today's  news may wonder  whether the split of the  companies  is
simply an elegant (or not so elegant)  casting away of our travel  businesses as
the competition in that sector increases.  I can tell you my answer directly: it
is not. And believing as strongly as I do in the prospects of both companies, my
equity holdings will be treated the same as that of our shareholders and will be
split  proportionately  between the two companies,  with each company ultimately
representing a very  substantial  portion of what I have worked long and hard to
accumulate.  Finally,  I intend to be a most  active  Chairman  at  Expedia,  in
addition to serving as both  Chairman  and CEO of  IAC...people  who would worry
about 'how my time is divided'  should  understand  that with my equity balanced
and given my current daily involvement in all of IAC's current businesses,  this
transaction  ought  to  provide  enhanced  focus  on each  entity - and I'm very
excited and energized by the opportunities in both.

With apologies to making any claim, one of the defining attributes of IAC, since
the  beginning,   has  been  a  refusal  to  be   constrained  by   conventional
wisdom...believing instead that a willingness to change - to 'turn on a dime' --
without  being  hostage  to the  past or any  other  consideration  where we see
opportunity, is a great way to create great value.

Separating  the Company  into two  businesses  will allow IAC to do what it does
best,  and  Expedia to pursue its pure  mission  as a travel  company.  It is, I
believe, exactly the right move at this moment in our history and evolution.

                                                                               3

Often the most obvious  solutions are elusive,  and this one came upon us, first
as a  revelation  that  instinctively  seemed  just  right  - both  freeing  and
energizing,  followed by an intensive  examination  to find any flaw - and then,
after  finding  none,  a great  desire to get on with it.  Now,  having made the
announcement  in the ending days of 2004,  all my colleagues  will be organizing
themselves to start the new year with a fresh,  clear and  invigorating  mandate
for the future - as good a holiday present as we could hope to give to ourselves
and our shareholders.

              EMPLOYEE Q&A: IAC PLAN TO SEPARATE INTO TWO COMPANIES

                                December 21, 2004

We announced today a plan to separate IAC/InterActiveCorp into two publicly
traded companies, one holding travel-related businesses, which will be named
Expedia, and the other holding IAC's remaining businesses, which will retain the
name IAC. References below to Expedia or IAC are to the companies after the
transaction.

     1. HOW WILL THE TRANSACTION AFFECT MY EMPLOYMENT?

     We expect you will  continue to be employed by the business  you  currently
     work for, subject to the same terms and conditions that exist today.

     2. WHAT HAPPENS TO MY EMPLOYEE EQUITY?

         o    We expect your restricted stock units ("RSUs") will become RSUs of
              IAC or Expedia depending on the business you work for. The number
              of RSUs you hold will be adjusted so that their value right after
              the transaction will be the same as their value right before the
              transaction, and they will have identical vesting terms and
              otherwise be consistent with the existing terms of your RSUs.

         o    We expect any vested and unvested employee stock options you hold
              will become options of either IAC or Expedia depending on the
              business you work for. As part of the transaction, there will be
              adjustments to the number of shares that may be acquired upon
              exercise of each option and to the exercise price so that the
              intrinsic value of the option right after the transaction will be
              the same as the value right before the transaction. Each adjusted
              option will have identical vesting terms, and otherwise be
              consistent with the terms of your existing stock option.

     3. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE EMPLOYEE WARRANTS HELD BY EXPEDIA EMPLOYEES?

     They  will be  treated  the  same as all  other  IAC  warrants.  The  exact
     mechanics  are  still  under  discussion,  but  we  expect  warrants  to be
     exercisable for shares of both IAC and Expedia pursuant to the terms of the
     security.

     4. WHAT HAPPENS TO MY PARTICIPATION IN THE IAC 401(K) PLAN AND MY ACCOUNT
        BALANCE?

     If you  participate in the IAC 401(k) plan, and your business  remains with
     IAC, your participation will continue. If you participate in the IAC 401(k)
     plan, and your business is

<PAGE>

     part of Expedia,  your IAC 401(k) plan account  balance and any outstanding
     loans will be  transferred  over into a new  Expedia  plan.  We'll keep you
     informed as the 401(k) plan transition progresses.

     5. WHAT HAPPENS TO MY BENEFITS?

     We do not expect any change to your benefits.  IAC employees will remain in
     the IAC plans and Expedia employees will transition to Expedia plans. We'll
     keep you informed as the health and welfare benefits transition progresses.



Information  presented  in this  document  is intended  to  communicate  certain
information  to  employees  of IAC and its  businesses  in  connection  with the
announced transaction whereby IAC will be split into two companies,  Expedia and
IAC.  Nothing in this  document  shall  confer  upon any  employee  any right to
continue in the employ of IAC or any of its  businesses  or interfere in any way
with the right of IAC or any such business to terminate the employees employment
at any time.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
In connection with the proposed spin-off it is currently  expected that IAC will
file a proxy  statement/prospectus  with the Securities and Exchange  Commission
(the   "SEC").   Stockholders   of   IAC   are   urged   to   read   the   proxy
statement/prospectus,  when  it  becomes  available,  because  it  will  contain
important  information about IAC, the proposed spin-off  transaction and related
matters.  Investors  and  security  holders  can obtain free copies of the proxy
statement/prospectus when it becomes available by contacting Investor Relations,

also obtain free copies of the proxy  statement/prospectus  and other  documents
filed by IAC and Expedia with the SEC in connection  with the proposed  spin-off
transaction at the SEC's web site at WWW.SEC.GOV.

reports,  proxy  statements  and other  information  with the SEC, each of which
should be available at the SEC's web site at WWW.SEC.GOV.  You may also read and
copy any  reports,  statements  and  other  information  filed by IAC at the SEC
public reference room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington,  D.C. 20549. Please

- --------------------------------------------------
We're announcing today a major change...the separation of IAC into two publicly
traded companies: Our travel businesses will form one company called Expedia;
our non-travel businesses will be called IAC.

The attached press release and shareholder letter have the detail and
explanation. There are a few points I want to emphasize:

First, I'm completely convinced that this is the right course for all of us. It
will result in a focused and nimble travel company with the full flexibility to
do whatever's necessary to compete and win in the ongoing evolution and likely
consolidation in travel. And it will result in a diversified interactive
commerce company called IAC, with our non-travel businesses out from under the
shadow of travel and better able to shine, and the enterprise more strongly
positioned to pursue new opportunities where they arise. The core realization
underlying our decision was simply this: greater value can be created in this
new configuration than any other.

Second, it's the hard and excellent work of all of you throughout IAC that
brought us to the point where we can unlock the value from the two great
companies now inside of us...the employees who built our travel businesses to a
size and strength where they can and should be unleashed as a stand-alone, and
the employees who built our non-travel businesses to a size and strength where
they can and should stand on their own in pursuit of the opportunities ahead.
It's a happy fact for me that I'll continue to be fully involved with both
companies, as CEO at IAC and as Chairman at Expedia.

Third, at both IAC and Expedia we'll continue to take every advantage from the
collection of businesses under each roof -- people movement; exchanging best
practices and lessons learned; cost savings from strategic sourcing and other
initiatives; sharing traffic and other beneficial inter-company arrangements.
We've made real progress here since the buy-ins of our public subsidiaries...and
we should continue to do so in each house, while also, in finalizing the split,
putting in place strong commercial relationships between IAC and Expedia and
preserving as much as we practically can of the inter-company benefits and
arrangements now in place between our travel and non-travel businesses.

This is big news and I don't doubt you'll have many thoughts and
questions...most hopefully addressed in the attached, and any others to be
addressed in the period ahead together with the leaders of each of your
businesses. This is a decision that was made after significant thought and
deliberation with my colleagues in New York and our Board of Directors, which
led us to

<PAGE>
the firm realization that we're doing the right thing for us all...I'll leave
you with the last graph of my shareholder letter since it pertains to you more
than anyone:


     "Often the most obvious solutions are elusive, and this one came upon us,
     first as a revelation that instinctively seemed just right - both freeing
     and energizing, followed by an intensive examination to find any flaw - and
     then, after finding none, a great desire to get on with it. Now, having
     made the announcement in the ending days of 2004, all my colleagues will be
     organizing themselves to start the new year with a fresh, clear and
     invigorating mandate for the future - as good a holiday present as we could
     hope to give to ourselves and our shareholders."

So, to the happiest of holidays for you and your families...and my best wishes
for the new year.

Barry Diller

To:  IAC Travel Employees
From:  Dara Khosrowshahi
Subject Line: IAC/Expedia

Everybody at IAC Travel,

I am extremely pleased to tell you that the IAC Travel companies will soon
become a separate, publicly traded company called Expedia and traded on the
NASDAQ. With the New Year will come a new beginning for Travel... one with its
inevitable challenges, but one in which we'll be positioned better than ever to
become the #1 provider of travel in the world.

I'm sure you have a lot of questions about how you'll be affected individually.
First, let me assure you that we're doing everything we can to make this
transition seamless with little, if any, impact at the operational level. Quite
simply, we expect people to continue to be employed by the business they work
for, at the same company locations. WE KNOW YOU WILL HAVE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW THIS AFFECTS YOUR BENEFITS, STOCK, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR JOB. BE ON THE
LOOKOUT FOR ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS.

I want to take this time to express how excited I am about this move and why I
believe that it's an incredibly positive thing for all IAC businesses.

Essentially, EXPEDIA will include all the domestic and international operations
associated with Expedia.com (including Expedia Canada, Newtrade Technologies and
Activity World), Hotels.com, IACT-Europe, IACT-Asia Pacific, Hotwire,
TripAdvisor, Expedia Corporate Travel, and Classic Custom Vacations. IAC will
include the domestic and international operations of all of the other IAC
businesses, including Ticketmaster, HSN, LendingTree, RealEstate.com Citysearch,
Entertainment Publications, Match.com, Precision Response Corporation, and
Interval International (Interval will be an IAC company because it is, at its
core, a membership and e-commerce exchange vs. a travel services company and
therefore it doesn't fit solely within the travel category).

Over the years since I've been involved with IAC, I have seen our travel
companies continuously innovate and execute on strategies that have literally
changed the nature of the travel industry. Something to truly be proud of. But
the online travel business has grown and matured since we entered it - and our
competitors are smarter than they ever have been. It's tempting when you are #1
(online at least) to become conservative, to play defense and try to protect
your lead. This announcement is all about playing offense - we are creating a
pure play online travel company that will be considerably attractive to
investors, provided of course that we execute effectively. We will also have the
flexibility that comes from having our own stock to capitalize on inevitable
market opportunities. And our equity and stock price performance will be
perfectly aligned with

<PAGE>

our operational performance. We are raising the stakes here, and I am convinced
it's the right time to do so.

We certainly have our challenges but I believe we have so much more opportunity.
The drumbeat march of online adoption in the travel and tourism industry will
continue, domestically as well as globally where we are just getting started.
Competition will be fierce, and you can bet that we will face new entrants,
changing dynamics and totally unexpected twists and turns along the way. But
that is exactly what makes this opportunity so exciting - this global travel
marketplace is ours to win. Going forward, Expedia will be:

     o    The world's best collection of online travel brands... each leaders in
          their category.

     o    The #1 online travel agency in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Germany. At
          a $12.7 billion gross bookings run rate for the 12 months ended
          9/30/04, we're on track to being the 3rd largest travel agency in the
          world, tied with JTB (Japan), behind only TUI (Germany) and American
          Express. I believe we can be the largest within five years, especially
          as a pure-play travel company.

     o    The only online travel player with deeply established beachheads in
          Europe and Asia... our international business is growing dramatically
          and gaining share, and Expedia Europe is solidly profitable.


     o    The most extraordinary team of people in any business anywhere in the
          world. We have outstanding talent at every level of the organization
          and I believe that our people and our ability to innovate are our
          not-so-secret weapon...we have to continue developing and training our
          employee base and keep bringing world-class talent into our company,
          at all levels.

I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to lead what will be one of the
world's largest pure-play travel companies. I couldn't be more excited about our
future and I'm looking forward to building this enterprise with you.

Dara
