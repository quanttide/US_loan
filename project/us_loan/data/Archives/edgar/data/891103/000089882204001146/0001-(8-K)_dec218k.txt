      ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS.

      On December 21, 2004, IAC/Interactive ("IAC") announced that its Board of
      Directors has approved a spin-off plan to separate IAC into two publicly
      traded companies: (1) Expedia and (2) IAC.

      The transaction is subject to a number of conditions including final
      approval by IAC's Board of Directors of transaction specifics, receipt of
      a tax opinion of counsel and the filing and effectiveness of registration
      statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, it is
      expected that IAC stockholder approval will be required. The proposed
      spin-off is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005.
