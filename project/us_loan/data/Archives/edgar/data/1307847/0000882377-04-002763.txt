<DESCRIPTION>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MORTGAGE POOL
<TEXT>


                                  EXHIBIT 99.2

         The mortgage loans delivered to the Trust Fund on the Closing Date (the
"Initial Mortgage Loans") and the mortgage loans delivered to the Trust Fund on
the Subsequent Transfer Date (the "Subsequent Mortgage Loans", and together with
the Initial Mortgage Loans, the "Mortgage Loans") consist of conventional,
one-to four- family, adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgage loans. The
Depositor purchased the Mortgage Loans from the Seller pursuant to the Mortgage
Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2004, between the Seller and
the Depositor, and the Depositor purchased the Subsequent Mortgage Loans from
the Seller pursuant to the Subsequent Mortage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as
of December 16, 2004. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as
of the Cut-off Date (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee, the Depositor will cause the
Mortgage Loans to be assigned to the Trustee for the benefit of the
certificateholders.

         The Mortgage Loans included in loan group I (the "Group I Mortgage
Loans") and loan group II (the "Group II Mortgage Loans") have an aggregate
principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of approximately $1,170,033,930 and
$329,964,215, respectively. The Group I Mortgage Loans will consist of
adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgage loans with principal balances at
origination that conform to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loan limits and the Group
II Mortgage Loans will consist of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgage loans
with principal balances at origination that may or may not conform to Freddie
Mac or Fannie Mae loan limits.

         The Mortgage Loans will be secured by mortgages or deeds of trust or
other similar security instruments creating first liens on residential
properties (the "Mortgaged Properties") consisting of attached, detached or
semi-detached one-to four-family dwelling units, individual condominium units or
individual units in planned unit developments and manufactured housing. The
Mortgage Loans will have original terms to maturity of not greater than 30 years
from the date on which the first payment was due on each Mortgage Loan.

         Each adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan will accrue interest at the
adjustable-rate calculated as specified under the terms of the related mortgage
note and each fixed-rate Mortgage Loan will have a Mortgage Rate that is fixed
for the life of such Mortgage (each such rate, a "Mortgage Rate").

         Approximately 93.39% of the Mortgage Loans were originated by
Ameriquest and approximately 6.61% of the Collateral Selection Date Mortgage
Loans were originated by the Seller's affiliate Town & Country Credit
Corporation (together with Ameriquest, the "Originators"), in each case by
aggregate scheduled principal balance of the Collateral Selection Date Mortgage
Loans as of the Cut-off Date.

         Each adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan will accrue interest at a Mortgage
Rate that is adjustable. The adjustable-rate Mortgage Loans will provide for
semi-annual adjustment to the Mortgage Rate thereon and for corresponding
adjustments to the monthly payment amount due thereon, in each case on each
adjustment date applicable thereto (each such date, an " Adjustment Date"). The
first adjustment will occur after an initial period of two years after
origination. On each Adjustment Date for each adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan, the
Mortgage Rate thereon will be adjusted (subject to rounding) to equal the sum of
the applicable Index (as defined below) and a fixed percentage amount (the "
Gross Margin"). The Mortgage Rate on each adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan will not
decrease on the first related Adjustment Date, will not increase by more than
2.000% per annum on the first related Adjustment Date (the " Initial Periodic
Rate Cap") and will not increase or decrease by more than 1.000% per annum on
any Adjustment Date thereafter (the " Periodic Rate Cap"). Each

<PAGE>


Mortgage Rate on each adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan will not exceed a specified
maximum Mortgage Rate over the life of such Mortgage Loan (the " Maximum
Mortgage Rate") or be less than a specified minimum Mortgage Rate over the life
of such Mortgage Loan (the " Minimum Mortgage Rate"). Effective with the first
monthly payment due on each adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan after each related
Adjustment Date, the monthly payment amount will be adjusted to an amount that
will amortize fully the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage
Loan over its remaining term, and pay interest at the Mortgage Rate as so
adjusted. Due to the application of the Periodic Rate Caps and the Maximum
Mortgage Rates, the Mortgage Rate on each such adjustable-rate Mortgage Loan, as
adjusted on any related Adjustment Date, may be less than the sum of the Index
and the related Gross Margin, rounded as described herein. None of the
adjustable-rate Mortgage Loans permits the related mortgagor to convert the
adjustable Mortgage Rate thereon to a fixed Mortgage Rate.

         The Mortgage Loans will have scheduled monthly payments due on the
first day of the month (with respect to each Mortgage Loan, a "Due Date"). Each
Mortgage Loan will contain a customary "due-on-sale" clause which provides that
(subject to state and federal restrictions) the Mortgage Loan must be repaid at
the time of sale of the related mortgaged property or with the consent of the
holder of the mortgage note assumed by a creditworthy purchaser of the related
mortgaged property.

         None of the Mortgage Loans will be buydown mortgage loans.

         Approximately 64.56% of the Group I Mortgage Loans and approximately
72.94% of the Group II Mortgage Loans, in each case by aggregate scheduled
principal balances of the related loan group as of the Cut-off Date, provide for
payment by the mortgagor of a prepayment charge on certain principal
prepayments, subject to certain limitations in the related mortgage note and
limitations upon collection in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Generally,
each such Mortgage Loan provides for payment of a prepayment charge on certain
prepayments made within a defined period set forth in the related Mortgage Note
(generally within the first three years but possibly as short as one year from
the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan). The amount of the prepayment
charge is as provided in the related Mortgage Note. The holders of the Class P
Certificates will be entitled to all prepayment charges received on the Mortgage
Loans in each loan group, and such amounts will not be available for
distribution on the other classes of Certificates. Under certain instances, as
described under the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Master
Servicer may waive the payment of any otherwise applicable prepayment charge.
Investors should conduct their own analysis of the effect, if any, that the
prepayment charges, and decisions by the Master Servicer with respect to the
waiver thereof, may have on the prepayment performance of the Mortgage Loans.
The Depositor makes no representation as to the effect that the prepayment
charges, and decisions by the Master Servicer with respect to the waiver
thereof, may have on the prepayment performance of the Mortgage Loans. As of
July 1, 2003, the Alternative Mortgage Parity Act of 1982 (the "Parity Act"),
which regulates the ability of the Originators to impose prepayment charges, was
amended, and as a result, the Originators will be required to comply with state
and local laws in originating mortgage loans with prepayment charge provisions
with respect to loans originated on or after July 1, 2003. The Depositor makes
no representations as to the effect that the prepayment charges, decisions by
the Master Servicer with respect to the waiver thereof and the recent amendment
of the Parity Act, may have on the prepayment performance of the Mortgage Loans.
However, the ruling of the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS") does not
retroactively affect loans originated before July 1, 2003. See "Legal Aspects of
Mortgage Assets--Enforceability of Certain Provisions--Prepayment Charges" in
the prospectus.
