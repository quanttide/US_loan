     Item 8.01. Other Events

     On December 23, 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago accepted the
Company's election to change its designation from a bank holding company to a
financial holding company. As a financial holding company, companies may engage
in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial
activity. This organizational change will allow the Company to move its
insurance affiliate, known as MainSource Insurance, from its wholly-owned bank
subsidiary to a direct subsidiary of the financial holding company in order to
provide insurance-related services to all of the Company's affiliates.
