<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">MILTON, N.Y., Dec. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Sono-Tek Corporation, (OTC Bulletin Board: SOTK) announced that it had entered into a new lending relationship with M&amp;T Bank. The new lending facility is composed of a revolving line of credit of $500,000 and a $150,000 capital improvement facility. Initial borrowings of $350,000 under the line of credit will be used to repay more costly borrowings from a previous banking relationship and other small loans.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Christopher L. Coccio, Sono-Tek&#146;s President/CEO was quoted &#147;We are very pleased with the service afforded us by M&amp;T Bank, by the Highland Office branch on both our commercial accounts, credit card services and now by its Hudson Valley regional lending officers and look forward to this new expanding banking relationship. All of our short-term borrowings are now concentrated with M&amp;T Bank. M&amp;T is a community-based bank with several branches close to our Hudson Valley manufacturing facility and yet it provides all the services of a major money center bank that are required to back up our growing domestic and international business. The branch and lending personnel are efficient in their day-to-day transaction processing and have reduced our annual banking fees and now the excellent package put together by the regional lending group will also reduce our interest costs.&#148;</font></p>
