<font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Sono-Tek Announces Extinguishment of Norwood<BR> Venture Corporation Put Rights and Exercise of All <BR>Common Stock Purchase Warrants</u></b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">December 20, 2004 - Sono-Tek Corporation, Milton, NY (OTC BB: SOTK) today announced that it had paid Norwood Venture Corporation $188,000 to prematurely extinguish its Put Rights under the Loan and Warrant Purchase Agreements between the Company and Norwood Venture Corporation.&#160; &#147;The early extinguishment of the Norwood Put Rights removes a future concern, which we would have had to face in three years. As the shareholder value of our Company increased, so did the cash value of the Put Rights.&#160; Through &#147;arms-length&#148; negotiation, we were able to reach an agreement whereby both parties benefited and Sono-Tek eliminated a future financial uncertainty&#148;, stated Christopher L. Coccio, Sono-Tek&#146;s President and CEO.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Coincident with the agreement described above, Norwood exercised all of its warrants to purchase 2,022,017 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. These warrants had been issued in conjunction with $850,000 of loans made to the Company, which the Company has prepaid to $600,000 currently.&#160; The Company plans to pay off another $450,000 of principal shortly.&#160; The exercise of these warrants will have no effect on the Company&#146;s calculation of diluted earnings per share, because the warrant shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for each financial period since issuance.</font></p>
