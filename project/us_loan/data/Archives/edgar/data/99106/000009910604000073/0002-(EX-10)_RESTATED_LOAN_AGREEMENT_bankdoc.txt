                         AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE LOANS


    A.  THE LOANS

    Section 2.1 Revolving Loan.

        (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Lender agrees to make revolving loans (each a "Revolving Loan" and collectively
"Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during
the period from the date of this Agreement up to, but not including, the
Termination Date of the Revolving Loan Commitment in an amount for each such
Revolving Loan not to exceed the Unused Revolving Loan Commitment Amount on such
Business Day; provided, however, that at no time shall the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of all Revolving Loans plus the Available Amount plus any
unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceed the Borrowing Base as in effect prior to
the making of such Revolving Loan.  So long as (i) the Borrower is in compliance
with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is

                                       -21-

<PAGE>

continuing (whether or not Lender has accelerated payment of the Loans) or would
result, and (iii) all other conditions set forth in Article 3 have been
satisfied, the Borrower may borrow, pay, prepay (pursuant to Section 2.1(d)),
and re-borrow under this Section 2.1.

        (b) The Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by, and repaid with interest
in accordance with, the promissory note of the Borrower, substantially in the
form of Exhibit A hereto (such promissory note is referred to herein as the
"Revolving Loan Note").  The Revolving Note issued to Lender shall (i) be
executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to Lender and be dated the date of
this Agreement, (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Revolving
Loan Commitment, and be payable in the outstanding principal amount of the
Revolving Loans evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the Maturity Date of the
Revolving Loans, (v) bear interest as provided in Section 2.5, and (vi) be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The
Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to record on the Revolving Loan Note or in its
internal computerized records the amount of each Revolving Loan and of each
payment of principal received by Lender on account of the Revolving Loans, which
recordation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as to the
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans evidenced thereby and shall
be considered correct and binding on the Borrower provided, however, that the
failure to make such recordation with respect to any Revolving Loan or payment
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement or the Revolving Loan Note.  The Revolving Loan Note amends, restates
and replaces in its entirety the Existing Revolving Loan Notes provided,
however, that the amendment, restatement and replacement of the Existing
Revolving Loan Notes shall in no way be construed as a novation of the
Borrower's indebtedness evidenced by the Existing Revolving Loan Notes.

        (c) The Borrower shall establish a loan account with Lender which
account shall be deemed to be the Revolving Loan Account.  Insofar as the
Borrower may request and the Lender shall make Revolving Loans hereunder, the
Lender shall enter such loans as debits to the Revolving Loan Account and shall
deposit such loans in the operating account of the Borrower maintained with the
Lender.  The Lender shall also record in the Revolving Loan Account, in
accordance with customary accounting procedures, (i) all other charges, expenses
and other Liens properly chargeable to the Borrower for which the Lender debits
the Revolving Loan Account, (ii) all payments made on account of the Revolving
Loans, (iii) all proceeds of Collateral which are finally paid to the Lender in
its office in cash, and (iv) other appropriate debits and credits.  The
Revolving Loan Account shall reflect the amount of the Borrower's Indebtedness
to the Lender from time to time by reason of the Revolving Loans less Revolving
Loan repayments, and other appropriate charges hereunder.

        (d) The Borrower may prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part,
together with accrued interest to the date of prepayment on the amount prepaid
(i) with respect to any principal portion that bears interest with reference to
the Base Rate, on any Business Day, without Make-Whole Premium, and (ii) with
respect to any principal portion that bears interest with reference to LIBOR
either (1) on the last Business Day of the Interest Period applicable to the
portion being prepaid, without Make-Whole Premium or (2) on any other Business
Day, together with the Make-Whole Premium.

        (e) The Borrower shall pay to the Lender, a fee (the "Revolving Loan
Unused Line Fee") equal to .0025% per annum times the average daily unused
portion of the Revolving Loan Commitment for the period from the Closing Date
through and including the Maturity Date of the Revolving Loans or any earlier
date of termination in full of the Revolving Loan Commitment.  The Revolving
Loan Unused Line Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears within ten (10) days
of the end of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower and on the Maturity Date of
the Revolving Loans or any earlier date of termination in full of the Revolving
Loan Commitment.

        (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Lender shall, on the date hereof make a term loan to the Borrower (the "Term

        (b) The Term Loan shall be evidenced by, and repaid in accordance with
the promissory note of the Borrower, substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B (the "Term Loan Note").  The Term Loan Note issued to Lender shall

hereof, (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to $10,000,000 and be
payable as provided in Section 2.2(d), (iv) mature on the Maturity Date of the
Term Loan, (v) bear interest as provided in Section 2.5, and (vi) be entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Term Loan Note
amends, restates and replaces in its entirety the Existing Term Loan Notes
provided, however, that the amendment, restatement and replacement of the
Existing Term Loan Notes shall in no way be construed as a novation of the
Borrower's indebtedness evidenced by the Existing Term Loan Notes.

        (c) The Borrower shall make quarterly payments of principal and interest
under the Term Loan Note in the amounts and at the times more particularly set
forth in said Term Loan Note, except that if not sooner paid, the principal
amount, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, shall be and
payable on the Maturity Date of the Term Loan.

        (d) The Borrower may prepay any portion of the outstanding principal of
the Term Loan, in whole or in part, together with accrued interest to the date
of such prepayment on the amount prepaid and all amounts required pursuant to
Section 2.17, (i) with respect to any principal portion that bears interest with
reference to the Base Rate, on any Business Day, without the Make-Whole Premium,
and (ii) with respect to any principal portion that bears interest with
reference to LIBOR either (1) on the last Business Day of the Interest Period
applicable to the portion of the Term Loan being prepaid, without the Make-Whole
Premium or (2) on any other Business Day, together with the Make-Whole Premium.
All prepayments of the Term Loan shall be applied in the inverse order of their
maturity.

        (e) Immediately upon receipt of any payments under the Pledged
Promissory Note, the Borrower shall prepay the Term Loan by an amount equal to
such payment, together with any Make-Whole Premium due in respect of any portion
of such prepayment that bears interest with reference to LIBOR.

Business Day during the period from the date of this Agreement up to, but not
including, the Termination Date of the Line of Credit Commitment in an amount

Credit Loan and of each payment of principal received by Lender on account of
the Line of Credit Loans, which recordation shall, in the absence of manifest
error, be conclusive as to the outstanding principal balance of the Line of
Credit Loans evidenced thereby and shall be considered correct and binding on
the Borrower provided, however, that the failure to make such recordation with
respect to any Line of Credit Loan or payment shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or the Line of
Credit Note.

        (c) The Borrower shall establish a loan account with Lender which
account shall be deemed to be the Line of Credit Account.  Insofar as the
Borrower may request and the Lender shall make Line of Credit Loans hereunder,
the Lender shall enter such loans as debits to the Line of Credit Account and
shall deposit such loans in the operating account of the Borrower maintained

    Section 2.6 Notice and Manner of Borrowing; Conversion or Continuation of
Interest Rate.

        (a) The Borrower shall give the Lender irrevocable notice by telephone

Rate Loans, three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed date thereof.  Each
such notice shall, in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, specify the duration of the
Interest Period therefor.  If no election is made in a Revolving Loan Borrowing
Request as to the Type applicable to any Revolving Loan, then the requested
Revolving Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.  If no election is made in a Revolving
Loan Borrowing Request as to the Interest Period applicable to any requested
LIBOR Rate Loan, then the Interest Period applicable to such requested LIBOR
Rate Loan shall (subject to the provisions contained in the definition of

borrowed under each Revolving Loan Request shall not be less than $50,000.
Subject to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3,
the Lender will make the Revolving Loan available to the Borrower on the date

Borrower pursuant to a written list provided to the Lender), of its selection of

        (c) The Borrower shall give the Lender irrevocable notice by telephone

LIBOR Rate Loans, three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed date thereof.
Each such notice shall, in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, specify the duration
of the Interest Period therefor.  If no election is made in a Line of Credit
Borrowing Request as to the Type applicable to any Line of Credit Loan, then the
requested Line of Credit Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.  If no election is made
in a Line of Credit Borrowing Request as to the Interest Period applicable to
any requested LIBOR Rate Loan, then the Interest Period applicable to such
requested LIBOR Rate Loan shall (subject to the provisions contained in the
definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.1) be one month in duration.
Subject to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3,
the Lender will make the Line of Credit Loan available to the Borrower on the
date requested by Borrower for such Line of Credit Loan by crediting such
proceeds to the Borrower's account with the Lender.  The Borrower agrees to

continue any LIBOR Rate Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan and (z) convert a LIBOR Rate
Loan to a Base Rate Loan on the last Business Day of the then current Interest
Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan; provided, that a Base Rate Loan may
not be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan and a LIBOR Rate Loan may not be continued
as such if any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  If
the Borrower desires to convert a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan or
continue a LIBOR Rate Loan pursuant to this Section 2.6(d), it shall give the
Lender not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice, specifying
the date of such conversion or continuation, the amount to be converted or
continued and if conversion is from a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan or a
LIBOR Rate Loan is to be continued, the duration of the Interest Period
therefor.  If, not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the end of the
Interest Period then in effect for any LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall not
have delivered to the Lender (i) a notice requesting conversion of a LIBOR Rate
Loan to a Base Rate Loan in accordance with this Section 2.6(d), (ii) a notice
requesting that such Loan be continued as a Loan of the same Type having an
Interest Period of the same or a different duration than the Interest Period in
effect, in accordance with this Section 2.6(d), or (iii) a notice that such Loan
is to be paid at the end of such Interest Period, then, in each such case, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a notice that such Loan is to be
converted to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to this Section 2.6(d).

    Section 2.7 Excess Advances.  If at any time the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans plus the Available Amount plus any
unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall

with accrued interest to the date of prepayment on the amount prepaid and, with
respect to any portion of such prepayment that bears interest with reference to
LIBOR, any Make-Whole Premium.

    B.  CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS

    Section 2.8 Taxes.

        (a) All payments by the Borrower under the Loan Documents to or for the
account of the Lender shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and free and
clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of, any and
all present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
fees, assessments, deductions, withholdings, or other charges of whatever
nature, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld, or assessed by
any jurisdiction, or by any department, agency, state or other political
subdivision thereof or therein (collectively, "Taxes"), excluding (i) a Tax on
the Income imposed on the Lender, and (ii) any interest, fees, additions to tax
or penalties for late payment thereof (each such non-excluded Tax, an
"Indemnified Tax").  For purposes hereof, "Tax on the Income" shall mean, as to
any Person, a Tax imposed by one of the following jurisdictions or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof:  (i) the United States, (ii)
the jurisdiction in which such Person is organized, or (iii) the jurisdiction in
which such Person's principal office is located, which Tax is an income tax or
franchise tax imposed on all or part of the net income or net profits of such
Person or which Tax represents interest, fees, or penalties for late payment of
such an income tax or franchise tax.  If any such obligation is imposed upon the
Borrower with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder or under any of the
other Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to each Lender on the date on which
such amount is due and payable hereunder or under such other Loan Document, such
additional amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable the Lender to
receive the same net amount which the Lender would have received on such due
date had no such obligation been imposed upon the Borrower.  The Borrower will
deliver promptly to the Lender certificates or other valid vouchers for all
taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by
the Borrower hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

        (b) If the Borrower, the Lender or any other Person is required by any
law, rule, regulation, order, directive, treaty or guideline to make any
deduction or withholding (which deduction or withholding would constitute an
Indemnified Tax) from any amount required to be paid by the Borrower to or on
behalf of the Lender under any Loan Document, (i) the Borrower shall pay such
Indemnified Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment
to be made for its own account (if the liability to pay is imposed on the
Borrower) or on behalf of and in the name of the Lender (if the liability is
imposed on the Lender), and (ii) the sum payable to the Lender shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions and
withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.8) the Lender receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.

        (c) The Borrower agrees to pay any current or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or
any waiver or consent under or in respect of the Loan Documents or otherwise
with respect to, the Loan Documents (collectively, the "Other Taxes").

                                       -29-

<PAGE>


        (d) Within thirty (30) days after the request therefor by the Lender in
connection with any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower
will furnish to the Lender the original or certified copy of an official receipt
from the jurisdiction to which payment is made evidencing payment thereof or, if
unavailable, a certificate from its chief financial officer or president that
states that such payment has been made and that sets forth the date and amount
of such payment.

        (e) Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, in its reasonable judgment, be
otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender.

        (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
this Section 2.8 shall survive the payment in full of Obligations and the
termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Line of Credit Commitment.

        (g) If requested by the Borrower, the Lender shall use its best efforts
to provide the Borrower with such Internal Revenue Service forms as are
reasonably necessary for the Borrower to fulfill its obligations hereunder, but
the failure of the Lender to provide such forms shall not in any way relieve or
postpone the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

    Section 2.9 Computations.  All computations of interest on the Loans and of
fees or other charges shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed.

    Section 2.10 Additional Payments.  If any present or future applicable law,
statute, rule or regulation thereunder or any interpretation thereof by any
competent court or by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration
or the interpretation thereof, or any request, directive, instruction or notice
at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or otherwise issued to the
Lender by any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether
or not having the force of law), shall:

        (a) subject the Lender to any tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, fee,
deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, any Letters of Credit, the Revolving Loan Commitment, the Line
of Credit Commitment or the Loans (other than taxes based upon or measured by
the income or profits of the Lender and imposed by the jurisdiction in which its
principal office is located), or

        (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes in taxes
on income or profits imposed by the jurisdiction in which the Lender's principal
office is located) of payments to the Lender of the principal of or the interest
on any Loans or any other amounts payable to the Lender under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, or

        (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the extent
specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) any special deposit,
reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar requirements
(whether or not having the force of law)

                                       -30-

<PAGE>

against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or
letters of credit issued by, or commitments of an office of the Lender, or

        (d) impose on the Lender any other conditions or requirements with
respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loans, any Letters of
Credit, the Revolving Loan Commitment, the Line of Credit Commitment or any
class of loans, letters of credit or commitments of which any of the Loans, any
Letters of Credit, the Revolving Loan Commitment or the Line of Credit
Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of the foregoing is

            (i) to increase the cost to the Lender of making, funding, issuing,
renewing, extending or maintaining the Loans, any Letters of Credit, the
Revolving Loan Commitment or the Line of Credit Commitment by an amount the
Lender reasonably deems to be material; or

            (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest, or other amount
payable to the Lender hereunder on account of the Loans, any Letters of Credit,
the Revolving Loan Commitment or the Line of Credit Commitment by an amount the
Lender reasonably deems to be material; or

            (iii) to require the Lender to make any payment or to forego any
interest or fee or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment of
foregone interest or other sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount of
any sum receivable or deemed received by the Lender from the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, upon demand made by the Lender
at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion therefor may
arise, pay to the Lender such additional amounts as will be sufficient to
compensate the Lender for such additional cost, reduction, payment, foregone
interest or other sum.

    Section 2.11 Capital Adequacy.  If Lender shall have determined that (i) the
adoption of or any change in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation
or order regarding capital adequacy of banks or bank holding companies, or (ii)
any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any applicable
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, or (iii) compliance
by Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy, whether or
not having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would
be unlawful, so long as the Lender believes in good faith that such has the
force of law or that the failure to so comply would be unlawful, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lender's capital as a
consequence of the Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that which
the Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance,
taking into consideration the Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy
immediately before such adoption, change or compliance and assuming that the
Lender's capital was fully utilized prior to such adoption, change or
compliance, by an amount deemed by the Lender in its reasonable judgment to be
material, then, upon demand, the Borrower shall pay immediately to the Lender,
from time to time as specified by the Lender, such additional amounts as shall
be sufficient to compensate the Lender for such reduced return, together with
interest on each such amount from the date of such specification by the Lender
until payment in full thereof at the then

                                       -31-

<PAGE>

current rate of interest applicable to Base Rate Loans.  In determining such
amount, the Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

    Section 2.12 Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if, at
any time, it becomes illegal for the Lender to make or maintain any Loan as a
LIBOR Rate Loan, the Lender shall give the Borrower written, telephonic or
facsimile notice of such condition.  Following such notice and until the Lender
has given the Borrower written notice of the termination of such condition, (a)
no LIBOR Rate Loans shall be available hereunder (and Lender shall be under any
obligation to make or continue, or to convert any Loans to, LIBOR Rate Loans),
(b) all Loans which were to be made or continued as, or converted to, LIBOR Rate
Loans shall instead be made or continued as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans,
and (c) if any Loan is then outstanding as a LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon request from the Lender, either prepay such LIBOR Rate Loan
in full, together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of
prepayment, or, at the Borrower's option, convert such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base
Rate Loan.  If any such prepayment or conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan is made on
a day that is not the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower
shall compensate the Lender as provided in Section 2.17 as a result of such
prepayment or conversion.

    Section 2.13 Certificate; Protection.  A certificate setting forth any
amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.11 or 2.17 and a brief explanation
of such amounts which are due, submitted by the Lender to the Borrower, shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing and of
the amounts due.  The protection of Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 2.17 shall be
available to the Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity
or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, agreement guideline or other
change or condition which shall have been imposed or shall have occurred.  The
obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 2.17 shall survive the
payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Revolving Loan
Commitment and the Line of Credit Commitment.

    Section 2.14 Obligations Absolute.  The obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents under all circumstances, and irrespective of the following
circumstances:

        (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of all or any portion of this
Agreement or any other agreement or any instrument relating hereto;

        (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
other term of, all or any of the Obligations;

        (c) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the
Borrower may have; or

        (d) any amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any of the
Loan Documents, or all or any of the Obligations in respect of the Loans or this
Agreement.

requirements and trading assets and to purchase equipment.  The proceeds of the
Line of Credit Loans shall be used by the Borrower to fund the repayment of up
to 50% of the Subordinated Notes.  The Letters of Credit shall finance the
Borrower's purchase of goods in the ordinary course of its business.  The
Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, use any part of the proceeds of any

due of the principal amount of, or interest on, any LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) default
by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any
LIBOR Rate Loan after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in

or repayment of funds obtained by the Lender or from fees payable to terminate
the deposits from which funds were obtained.

    Section 2.18 Termination of Revolving Loans.  In the event that the Borrower
pays or prepays any Revolving Loan in full on or prior to the Termination Date
of the Revolving Loan Commitment and terminates the Revolving Loan Commitment,
and if on the date of such payment any Letter of Credit is outstanding, the
Borrower shall pay an amount to the Lender equal to the Available Amount under
such Letter of Credit on such date as cash collateral for such Letter of Credit.
Such amount shall be held by the Lender as provided in Section 2.20(i).

    Section 2.19 Mandatory Prepayment.  In the event and on each occasion that
the Loan- to-Value Ratio exceeds fifty percent (50%), Borrower shall, not later
than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following each date on which such

additional Collateral in form and amount and upon such terms as Lender shall
require on or before the expiration of said 15 Day Period.

    D.  LETTERS OF CREDIT

    Section 2.20 Letters of Credit.

        (a) General.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Lender
shall issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower; provided,
however, that the Lender will not issue any Letters of Credit to the extent that
the issuance of such Letters of Credit would then cause the sum of (i) the
outstanding Revolving Loans plus (ii) the Letter of Credit Obligations (with the
requested Letter of Credit being deemed to be outstanding for purposes of this
calculation) to exceed the Borrowing Base in effect prior to the issuance of the
requested Letter of Credit or would then cause the Letter of Credit Obligations
(with the requested Letter of Credit being deemed to be outstanding for purposes
of this calculation) to exceed the L/C Sublimit.  Letters of Credit that have
not been drawn upon shall not bear interest.  Letters of Credit shall only be
issued by the Lender for the account of the Borrower to support trading assets
and the general working capital needs of the Borrower.

        (b) Request.  In order to request the issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall deliver to the Lender a
letter of credit application on the Lender's then customary form (the "Letter of
Credit Application"), completed by the Borrower, the terms of which are hereby
incorporated by reference; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict
or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Letter
of Credit Applications, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

        (c) Form.  Each Letter of Credit shall, among other things, (1) be on
the Lender's then customary form, (2) provide for the payment of sight drafts
for honor thereunder when presented in accordance with the terms thereof and
when accompanied by the documents described therein, and (3) be subject to the
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No.  500)
and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of
Connecticut.

        (d) Expiry Dates.  Each Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date of
the earlier of (i) the date which is not later than one hundred eighty (180)
days after the date of issuance and (ii) the Termination Date of the Revolving
Loan Commitment.

        (e) Reimbursement Obligation.  In order to induce the Lender to issue,
extend or renew the Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby agrees and promises
to reimburse or pay to the Lender, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued,
extended or renewed hereunder, on each date that any draft or demand presented
or made under such Letter of Credit is honored by the Lender, or on which the
Lender otherwise makes a payment with respect thereto, (i) the amount paid by
the Lender under or with respect to such Letter of Credit, and (ii) the amount
of any taxes, fees, charges or other costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by
the Lender in connection with any payment made by the Lender under, or with
respect to, such Letter of Credit (collectively, the "Reimbursement
Obligations").  Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations shall bear interest at a per
annum rate equal to the Default Rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.

        (f) Letter of Credit Fees.  In the event that the Lender issues, extends
or renews any Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (whether
collectively or

                                       -34-

<PAGE>

individually), the Borrower shall pay to the Lender on the date of such
issuance, extension or renewal, a fee of one eighth percent (0.125%) per annum.
In addition, the Borrower shall remit to the Lender a fee equal to the
applicable LIBOR Rate Margin, as in effect from time to time, times the maximum
face amount of each Letter of Credit, which fee shall be payable monthly in
arrears on each day that interest on Base Rate Loans is payable hereunder.  The
Borrower shall also pay the Lender's usual and customary administration and
negotiation fees with respect to each Letter of Credit.  The fees specified in
this Section 2.20(f) shall be referred to herein as "Letter of Credit Fees".

        (g) Obligations Unconditional.  The obligations of the Borrower under
Section 2.20(e) and Section 2.20(f) shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with this Agreement,
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of and Lender shall be liable
or responsible for:  (1) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or any other Loan Document, or any term or provision therein; (2) any
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the
provisions of any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document; (3) the existence
of any dispute, claim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower, any
other party guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other Person may at any time have
against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, against the Lender or
against any other Person whatsoever, whether in connection with this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or
transaction; (4) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit
or any endorsement thereon proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate
in any respect; (5) payment by the Lender under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of
such Letter of Credit; (6) any error, omission, interruption or delay in any
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit; and (7) any other act or
omission to act or delay of any kind of the Lender or any other Person or any
other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this subsection, constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

    The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Lender under or
in connection with any Letter of Credit and the related drafts and documents, if
done in good faith, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not result in
any liability on the part of the Lender to the Borrower.  It is understood that
the Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order,
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of
Credit (i) the Lender's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it
under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein,
including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of
Credit, whether or not the amount due the beneficiary thereunder equals the
amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such
Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on
its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any
other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged
or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any
respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the

                                       -35-

<PAGE>


documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in
each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct, gross negligence or
bad faith of or by the Lender.

        (h) Reliance by the Lender.  The Lender shall be entitled to rely and
shall be fully protected in relying upon (without responsibility for further
investigation), any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document reasonably believed by it
to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
person or persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Lender.

        (i) Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Borrower shall, on the Business Day it receives notice from the
Lender thereof and of the amount to be deposited (or automatically on the
occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Section 9.1(f)), deposit in an
account with the Lender an amount in cash equal to the Available Amount as of
such date.  Such deposit, and any amount deposited pursuant to Section 2.18,
shall be held by the Lender as collateral for the payment and performance of all
Reimbursement Obligations then arising or which in the future arise for any and
all outstanding Letters of Credit.  The Lender shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Such
deposits shall not bear interest.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by
the Lender to any Reimbursement Obligations for which the Lender has not
otherwise been reimbursed, or, at the Lender's sole discretion, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated and there are no Letter of Credit Obligations,
to satisfy any other Obligations.  If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral under this subsection as a result of the occurrence of
an Event of Default, such amount shall be returned to the Borrower within three
Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

that, insofar as the Borrower can now reasonably foresee, may materially
adversely affect, the condition, financial or otherwise, operations, properties,
or prospects of the Borrower or any Guarantor, except possible worldwide events

is a party to the extent that such default would have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Borrower and each Guarantor enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all leases to which it is a party.  Without limiting the
generality of the forgoing, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender

possesses all licenses, permits, franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks,
and trade names, or rights thereto, to conduct its business substantially as now
conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, and neither the Borrower
nor any Guarantor is in violation of any rights of others with respect to any of
the foregoing except where the failure to possess such licenses or any such
violation would not cause a Material Adverse Effect.  No claims have been
received by the Borrower's or any Guarantor's officers or directors to the
effect that (i) any product, process, method, substance, part or other material
presently contemplated to be sold by or employed by it in connection with such
business may infringe any Patent, Trademark, service mark, trade name,
Copyright, License or other right owned by any other Person, (ii) there is
pending or threatened any claim or litigation against or affecting it contesting
its right to sell or use any such product, process, method, substance, part or
other material where such claim or litigation, if decided adversely to the
Borrower or any Guarantor, would have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) there
has been any infringement or violation of any Patent, Trademark, service mark,
trade name, Copyright, License or other right owned by the Borrower or any
Guarantor which if continuing, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

    Section 4.11 Taxes.  The Borrower and the Guarantors have filed all tax
returns (federal, state, and local) required to be filed and have paid all
taxes, assessments, and governmental charges and levies thereon which are due,
including interest and penalties, except where the failure to file such returns

Regulations U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board"), or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin
security, or for any other purpose which might cause any of the Loans or any of
the Letters of Credit to be considered a "purpose credit" within the meaning of
Regulation T, U, or X of the Federal Reserve Board.  Less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Borrower's or any Guarantor's assets and none of the

                              GRANT OF COLLATERAL

        (a) Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, as collateral security for
the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations, the Borrower
hereby grants to the Lender Security Interests in and Liens upon all of its

        (b) The Borrower and Lender agree that this Agreement creates, and is
intended to create, valid and continuing Liens upon the Collateral in favor of
Lender.  The Borrower represents, warrants and promises to Lender that:  (i) the
Borrower is the sole owner of each item of the Collateral upon which it purports
to grant a Lien pursuant to the Loan Documents, and has good and marketable
title thereto free and clear of any and all Liens or claims of others, other
than Permitted Encumbrances or Liens being released on the Closing Date; (ii)
the Security Interests granted pursuant to this Agreement constitute valid
perfected Security Interests in all of the Collateral in favor of the Lender as

<PAGE>

no effective security agreement, financing statement, equivalent security or
Lien instrument or continuation statement covering all or any part of the

title and interest of the Lender in and to the Collateral against the claims and
demands of all Persons whomsoever, and shall take such actions, including (x)
the prompt delivery of all original Instruments, Chattel Paper and certificated
Stock owned by the Borrower to Lender, (y) notification of Lender's interest in
Collateral at Lender's request, and (z) the institution of litigation against

    Section 8.2 Lender's Rights

        (a) Lender may, (i) at any time in the Lender's own name or in the name
of the Borrower, communicate with Account Debtors, parties to Contracts, and
obligors in respect of Instruments, Chattel Paper or other Collateral to verify
to the Lender's satisfaction, the existence, amount and terms of any such
Accounts, Contracts, Instruments or Chattel Paper or other Collateral, and (ii)
after an Event of Default which is continuing, at any time and without prior
notice to the Borrower, notify Account Debtors, parties to Contracts, and
obligors in respect of Chattel Paper, Instruments, or other Collateral that the
Collateral has been assigned to the Lender and that payments shall be made
directly to the Lender.  Upon the request of the Lender, the Borrower shall so
notify such Account Debtors, parties to Contracts, and obligors in respect of
Instruments, Chattel Paper or other Collateral.  The Borrower hereby constitutes
the Lender or Lender's designee as the Borrower's attorney with power to endorse
the Borrower's name upon any notes, acceptance drafts, money orders or other
evidences of payment or Collateral.

        (b) It is expressly agreed by the Borrower that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall remain liable under each
Contract, Instrument and License to observe and perform all the conditions and
obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, and Lender shall have
no obligation or liability whatsoever to any Person under any Contract,
Instrument or License (between the Borrower and any Person other than the
Lender) by reason of or arising out of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement, and the Lender shall not be required or obligated in any manner
(i) to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of the Borrower, (ii) to make
any payment or inquiry, or (iii) to take any action of any kind to collect or
enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts which may have been
assigned to them or to which they may be entitled at any time or times under or

controlled property or facility, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice (unless a Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in which event no notice shall be required and the Lender shall have
access at any and all times):  (i) provide access to such facility or property
to

                                       -56-

<PAGE>

the Lender and any of their officers, employees and agents, as frequently as the
Lender determine to be appropriate; (ii) permit the Lender and any of its
officers, employees and agents to inspect, audit and make extracts from all of
the Borrower's Books and Records; and (iii) permit the Lender to inspect,
review, evaluate and make physical verifications and appraisals of the
Collateral in any manner and through any medium that the Lender considers
advisable, and the Borrower agrees to render to the Lender, at the Borrower's
cost and expense, such clerical and other assistance as may be reasonably
requested with regard thereto.  The Borrower shall make available to the Lender
and its counsel, as quickly as practicable under the circumstances, originals or
copies of all the Borrower's Books and Records and any other instruments and
documents which the Lender may request.  The Borrower shall deliver any document
or instrument reasonably necessary for the Lender, as they may from time to time
reasonably request, to obtain records from any service bureau or other Person
which maintains records for the Borrower.

the Borrower shall execute and deliver a Power of Attorney in the form attached
as Exhibit H.  The power of attorney granted pursuant to the Power of Attorney
and all powers granted under any Loan Documents are powers coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable until all Obligations have been paid and
satisfied in full.  The powers conferred on the Lender under the Power of
Attorney are solely to protect the Lender's interests in the Collateral and
shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers.  The Lender
agrees and promises that (a) it shall not exercise any power or authority
granted under the Power of Attorney unless an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, (b) the Lender shall only exercise the powers granted under the
Power of Attorney in respect of Collateral, provided, except as otherwise
required by applicable law, the Lender shall not have any duty as to any
Collateral, and the Lender shall be accountable only for amounts that it
actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers.  NONE OF LENDER OR
ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE
RESPONSIBLE TO THE BORROWER FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT PURSUANT TO THE POWERS
GRANTED UNDER THE POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT FOR ITS OWN GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, NOR FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  The Borrower also hereby authorizes the Lender to file
any financing or continuation statement without the signature of the Borrower to
the extent permitted by applicable law.

irrevocably authorizes the Lender at any time and from time to time to file in
any filing office in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any initial
financing statements and amendments thereto that (a) indicate the Collateral (i)
as all assets of the Borrower or words of similar effect, regardless of whether
any particular asset comprised in the Collateral falls within the scope of
Article 9 of the Code, or (ii) as being of an equal or lesser scope or with
greater detail, and (b) provide any other information required by part 5 of
Article 9 of the Code, for the sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any
financing statement or amendment, including (i) whether the Borrower is an
organization, the type of organization and any organizational identification
number issued to the Borrower and, (ii) in the case of a financing statement
filed as a fixture

                                       -57-

filing, a sufficient description of real property to which the Collateral
relates.  Borrower agrees to furnish any such information to the Lender promptly
upon the Lender's request.  The Borrower also ratifies its authorization for the
Lender to have filed in any Code jurisdiction any like initial financing
statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof.

        (b) Other Actions.  To further the attachment, perfection and first
priority of, and the ability of the Lender to enforce, the Lender's security
interest in the Collateral, and without limitation on the Borrower's other
obligations in this Agreement, the Borrower agrees, in each case at the
Borrower's expense, to take the following actions with respect to the following
Collateral:

            (i) Promissory Notes and Tangible Chattel Paper.  If the Borrower
shall at any time hold or acquire any promissory notes or tangible chattel
paper, the Borrower shall immediately notify the Lender that it holds such
promissory notes or tangible chattel paper and shall, at the request of the
Lender, forthwith endorse, assign and deliver the same to the Lender,
accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank
as the Lender may from time to time specify.

            (ii) Deposit Accounts.  For each deposit account that the Borrower
at any time opens or maintains, in the event that the Lender deems itself
insecure in its sole discretion, the Borrower shall, at the Lender's request,
pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender,
either (a) cause the depositary bank to comply at any time with instructions
from the Lender to such depositary bank directing the disposition of funds from
time to time credited to such deposit account, without further consent of the
Borrower, or (b) if the depository bank is unwilling to execute such an
agreement within ten days after being requested to do so, arrange for the Lender
to become the customer of the depositary bank with respect to the deposit
account, with the Borrower being permitted, only with the consent of the Lender,
to exercise rights to withdraw funds from such deposit account.  The Lender
agrees with the Borrower that the Lender shall not give any such instructions or
withhold any withdrawal rights from the Borrower, unless a Default has occurred
and is continuing, or would occur, if effect were given to any withdrawal not
otherwise permitted by the Loan Documents.  The provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply to (i) any deposit account for which the Borrower, the
depositary bank and the Lender have entered into a cash collateral agreement
specially negotiated among the Borrower, the depositary bank and the Lender for
the specific purpose set forth therein, (ii) a deposit account for which the
Lender is the depositary bank and is in automatic control, and (iii) deposit
accounts specially and exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes and other
employee wage and benefit payments to or for the benefit of the Borrower's
employees.

            (iii) Investment Property.  If the Borrower shall at any time hold
or acquire any certificated securities, in the event that the Lender deems
itself insecure in its sole discretion, the Borrower shall forthwith endorse,
assign and deliver the same to the Lender, accompanied by such instruments of
transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Lender may from time to
time specify.  If any securities now or hereafter acquired by the Borrower are
uncertificated and are issued to the Borrower or its nominee directly by the
issuer thereof, the Borrower shall immediately notify the Lender thereof and, at
the Lender's request, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lender, either (a) cause the issuer to agree to

                                       -58-

<PAGE>

comply with instructions from the Lender as to such securities, without further
consent of the Borrower or such nominee, or (b) if the issuer is unwilling to
execute such an agreement within ten days after being requested to do so,
arrange for the Lender to become the registered owner of the securities.  If any
securities, whether certificated or uncertificated, or other investment property
now or hereafter acquired by the Borrower are held by the Borrower or its
nominee through a securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, the
Borrower shall immediately notify the Lender thereof and, at the Lender's
request, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Lender, either (i) cause such securities intermediary or (as the case may be)
commodity intermediary to agree to comply with entitlement orders or other
instructions from the Lender to such securities intermediary as to such
securities or other investment property, or (as the case may be) to apply any
value distributed on account of any commodity contract as directed by the Lender
to such commodity intermediary, in each case without further consent of the
Borrower or such nominee, or (ii) if such securities intermediary is unwilling
to execute such an agreement, in the case of financial assets or other
investment property held through a securities intermediary, arrange for the
Lender to become the entitlement holder with respect to such investment
property, with the Borrower being permitted, only with the consent of the
Lender, to exercise rights to withdraw or otherwise deal with such investment
property.  The Lender agrees with the Borrower that the Lender shall not give
any such entitlement orders or instructions or directions to any such issuer,
securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, and shall not withhold its
consent to the exercise of any withdrawal or dealing rights by the Borrower,
unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, or, after giving effect to any
such investment and withdrawal rights not otherwise permitted by the Loan
Documents, would occur.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any
financial assets credited to a securities account for which the Lender is the
securities intermediary.

            (iv) Collateral in the Possession of a Bailee.  If any Collateral is
at any time in the possession of a bailee, the Borrower shall promptly notify
the Lender thereof and, at the Lender's request and option, shall promptly
obtain an acknowledgement from the bailee, in form and substance satisfactory to
the Lender, that the bailee holds such Collateral for the benefit of the Lender,
and that such bailee agrees to comply, without further consent of the Borrower
with instructions from the Lender as to such Collateral.  The Lender agrees with
the Borrower that the Lender shall not give any such instructions unless a
Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking into account
any action by the Borrower with respect to the bailee.

            (v) Electronic Chattel Paper and Transferable Records.  If Borrower
at any time holds or acquires an interest in any electronic chattel paper or any
"transferable record," as that term is defined in Section 201 of the federal
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or in S16 of the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction,
the Borrower shall promptly notify the Lender thereof and, at the request and
option of the Lender, shall take such action as the Lender may reasonably
request to vest in the Lender control, under S9-105 of the Code, of such
electronic chattel paper or control under Section 201 of the federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or, as the case may be, S16 of
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as so in effect in such jurisdiction,
of such transferable record.  The Lender agrees with the Borrower that the
Lender will arrange, pursuant to procedures satisfactory to the Lender and so
long as such procedures will not result in the Lender's loss of control, for the
Borrower to make alterations to the electronic chattel paper or

                                       -59-

<PAGE>

transferable record permitted under S9-105 of the Code or, as the case may be,
Section 201 of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
Act or S16 of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act for a party in control to
make without loss of control, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing or
would occur after taking into account any action by the Borrower with respect to
such electronic chattel paper or transferable record.

            (vi) Letter-of-Credit Rights.  If the Borrower is at any time a
beneficiary under a letter of credit, the Borrower shall promptly notify the
Lender thereof and, at the request and option of the Lender, in the event that
the Lender deems itself insecure in its sole discretion, the Borrower shall,
pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender,
either (i) arrange for the issuer and any confirmer or other nominated person of
such letter of credit to consent to an assignment to the Lender of the proceeds
of the letter of credit or (ii) arrange for the Lender to become the transferee
beneficiary of the letter of credit, with the Lender agreeing, in each case,
that the proceeds of the letter to credit are to be held by the Lender as cash
collateral for the Obligations.  The Lender may, at its sole option, disburse
from time to time all or any part of such proceeds so held as cash collateral,
upon such terms and conditions as the Lender may reasonably prescribe, directly
to the Borrower, or the Lender may apply all or any part of such proceeds to the
Obligations in such order or preference as the Lender may determine, in its sole
discretion.

            (vii) Commercial Tort Claims.  If the Borrower shall at any time
hold or acquire a commercial tort claim, the Borrower shall immediately notify
the Lender in a writing signed by the Borrower of the particulars thereof and
grant to the Lender in such writing a security interest therein and in the
proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be
in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender.

            (viii) Other Actions as to any and all Collateral.  The Borrower
further agrees, at the request and option of the Lender, to take any and all
other actions the Lender may determine to be necessary or useful for the
attachment, perfection and first priority of, and the ability of the Lender to
enforce, the Lender's security interest in any and all of the Collateral,
including, without limitation, (a) executing, delivering and, where appropriate,
filing financing statements and amendments relating thereto under the Code, to
the extent, if any, that the Borrower's signature thereon is required therefor,
(b) causing the Lender's name to be noted as secured party on any certificate of
title for a titled good if such notation is a condition to attachment,
perfection or priority of, or ability of the Lender to enforce, the Lender's
security interest in such Collateral, (c) complying with any provision of any
statute, regulation or treaty of the United States as to any Collateral if
compliance with such provision is a condition to attachment, perfection or
priority of, or ability of the Lender to enforce, the Lender's security interest
in such Collateral, (d) obtaining governmental and other third party waivers,
consents and approvals in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender,
including, without limitation, any consent of any licensor, lessor or other
person obligated on Collateral, (e) obtaining waivers from mortgagees and
landlords in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender and (f) taking all
actions under any earlier versions of the Code or under any other law, as
reasonably determined by the Lender to be applicable in any relevant Uniform
Commercial Code or other jurisdiction, including any foreign jurisdiction.

    Section 8.5 Continuous Security Interest.  The Borrower expressly
acknowledge that

                                       -60-

<PAGE>

the security interests granted under the Existing Loan Agreement and remade
hereunder shall remain as security for payment and performance of the
Obligations, whether now existing or which may hereafter be incurred by future
advances, or otherwise.  The notice of the continuing grant of this security
interest therefore shall not be required to be stated on the face of any
document representing any such Obligations, nor otherwise identify it as being
secured hereby.


                                   ARTICLE 9


                               EVENTS OF DEFAULT


    Section 9.1 Events of Default.

    Each of the following shall be an "Event of Default":

        (a) The Borrower shall fail to pay the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes, or any amount of any fee, or any other liability or

Notes, which in the case of any payment except the principal of any Loan or any
Reimbursement Obligation, continues for more than ten (10) days;

        (b) Any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower
or any Guarantor in any of the Loan Documents, or which is contained in any

been false in any material respect on or as of the date made or deemed made or
furnished;

        (c) The Borrower shall fail to comply with any of the covenants
contained in Articles 5, 6 and 7 provided, however, the Borrower shall have a
ten (10) day grace period to comply with the reporting requirements contained in

        (d) The Borrower or any Guarantor shall fail to perform or observe any
material term, covenant or agreement contained herein or in any of the other

        (e) The Borrower or any Guarantor shall (A) fail to pay any indebtedness
for borrowed money in excess of $500,000 (other than the Notes), including any
interest or premium thereon, when due (whether by scheduled maturity, required
prepayment, acceleration, demand, or otherwise), (B) fail to perform or observe
any term, covenant, or condition on its part to be performed or observed under
any agreement or instrument relating to any such indebtedness, when required to
be performed or observed (including any applicable grace periods), if the effect
of such failure to perform or observe is to accelerate, or to permit the
acceleration after the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, of the
maturity of such indebtedness, whether or not such failure to perform or observe
shall be waived by the holder of such indebtedness; or any such indebtedness
shall be declared to be due and payable, or required to be prepaid (other than
by a regularly scheduled required prepayment), prior to the stated maturity
thereof, or (C) be in default under any other indebtedness of the Borrower or
such Guarantor to the Lender; or any other event or condition shall occur or
exist if the effect of such other event or condition is to

                                       -61-

<PAGE>

accelerate, or to permit the acceleration after the giving of notice or passage
of time, or both, of the maturity of such indebtedness, whether or not the
occurrence of such other event or condition shall be waived by the holder of
such indebtedness, provided, however, that the event described on Schedule
9.1(e) shall not be considered an Event of Default;

        (f) The Borrower or any Guarantor (A) shall generally not, or shall be
unable to, or shall admit in writing its inability to, pay its debts as such
debts become due; or (B) shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
petition or apply to any tribunal for the appointment of a custodian, receiver,
or trustee for it or a substantial part of its assets; or (C) shall commence any
proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of
debt, dissolution, or liquidation law or statute of any jurisdiction, whether
now or hereafter in effect; or (D) shall have any such petition or application

is entered or adjudication or appointment is made or which remains undismissed
for a period of sixty (60) days or more; or (E) by any act or omission shall
indicate its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in any such petition,
application, or proceeding, or order for relief, or the appointment of a
custodian, receiver, or trustee for all or any substantial part of its
properties; or (F) shall suffer any such custodianship, receivership, or
trusteeship to continue undischarged for a period of sixty (60) days or more;

        (g) One or more judgments, decrees, or orders for the payment of money
which in the aggregate exceeds $250,000.00 shall be rendered against the
Borrower or any Guarantor and such judgments, decrees, or orders shall continue
unsatisfied and in effect for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days without
being vacated, discharged, satisfied, or stayed or bonded pending appeal;

        (h) Any Security Document shall at any time after its execution and
delivery and for any reason other than an act or omission by the Lender cease to
create a valid and perfected first priority security interest (or such lesser
priority security interest as may be specifically set forth therein) in and to
the property purported to be subject to such Security Document or otherwise to
be in full force and effect, or any Security Document shall be declared null and
void, or the validity or enforceability thereof shall be contested by the
Borrower, or the Borrower shall deny it has any further liability or obligation
under any Security Document, or the Borrower shall fail to perform any of its
obligations under any Security Document subject to any notice and cure
provisions contained in any Security Document;

        (i) Any event shall occur or exist with respect to the Borrower which
could in the opinion of the Lender subject the Borrower to any tax, penalty, or
other liability under or in connection with ERISA in excess of $250,000;

        (j) There shall occur any uninsured damage to or loss, theft, or
destruction of any of the Collateral having a value of more than $500,000;

        (k) The Borrower or any Guarantor ceases to conduct its business as
currently conducted or is enjoined, restrained or in any way prevented by court
order from conducting all or any material part of its business affairs;

                                       -62-

<PAGE>


        (l) There shall occur a revocation or attempted revocation by any
Guarantor of such Guarantor's Guaranty or any Guaranty shall otherwise be
terminated or is otherwise not in full force and effect for any reason
whatsoever; or

(financial or otherwise), operations, properties or business of (i) the Borrower
or (ii) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates taken as a whole.

Default, the Lender may (1) declare the Commitments to be terminated, whereupon
the same shall forthwith terminate and/or (2) declare all the outstanding
indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and all other amounts payable under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any Make-Whole Premium or termination
fee that the Borrower would have been obligated to pay had it then elected to
prepay the Notes and terminate the Commitments), to be forthwith due and
payable, whereupon the Commitments shall be terminated and the Notes, all such
interest, and all such other amounts shall become and be forthwith due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest, or further notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; provided, however,
that upon the occurrence of any event described in Section 9.1(f), the
Commitments shall terminate and the outstanding Notes, all interest thereon, and
all such other amounts payable under this Agreement shall become automatically
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, or further notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver of such right, power, or remedy,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy under
any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power, or remedy.  The remedies provided in the
Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

    Section 10.4 Successors and Assigns.

        (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower and the Lender and their respective successors and assigns; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not (by agreement, operation of law, or
otherwise) assign any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations, under
any of the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party without the prior
written consent of the Lender, and any such assignment or delegation made
without such consent shall be null and void.  Lender may sell participations in,
or may,

                                       -64-

<PAGE>

subject to Section 10.4(b), assign, all or any part of any of the Loans and its
rights and obligations hereunder to another lender, in which event (a) in the
case of an assignment, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment
(unless otherwise provided therein), the same rights, benefits and obligations
as it would have if it were a Lender hereunder; and (b) in the case of a
participation, the participant shall have no rights under the Loan Documents.
The agreement executed by Lender in favor of the participant shall not give the
participant the right to require Lender to take or omit to take any action
hereunder except action directly relating to (i) the extension of a payment date
with respect to any portion of the principal of or interest on any amount
outstanding hereunder allocated to such participant or any fee payable to such
participant, (ii) the reduction of the principal amount outstanding hereunder or
(iii) the reduction of the rate of interest payable on such amount or any amount
of fees payable hereunder to a rate or amount below that which such participant
is entitled to receive under its agreement with Lender.  Lender may furnish any
information concerning the Borrower in the possession of Lender from time to
time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants); provided that Lender shall, if requested by the Borrower, require
any such prospective assignee or such participant (prospective or otherwise) to
agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of such information, except as
required by applicable laws or regulatory or governmental authorities.  Lender
may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents
including any portion of the Notes to any of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve
Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.  Section
341.  No such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release Lender from its
obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

        (b) Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, Borrower hereby
agrees that Lender, in its sole discretion, shall have the unrestricted right at
any time and from time to time, and without the consent of or notice to Borrower
or any Guarantor, to assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations
hereunder to one or more Eligible Transferees, and in the event of any such
assignment to an Eligible Transferee, Borrower agrees that it shall execute, or
cause to be executed, such documents, including without limitation, amendments
to this Agreement and to any other Loan Documents, as Lender shall deem
necessary to effect the foregoing.  In addition, at the request of Lender and
any such Eligible Transferee, Borrower shall issue one or more new Notes, as
applicable, to any such Eligible Transferee and, if Lender has retained any of
its rights and obligations following such assignment, to Lender, which new Notes
shall be issued in replacement of, but not in discharge of, the Obligations
evidenced by the Notes held by Lender prior to such assignment which are being
replaced and shall reflect the amount of the respective commitments and Loans
held by such Eligible Transferee and Lender after giving effect to such
assignment.  Upon the execution and delivery of appropriate assignment
documentation, amendments and any other documentation required by Lender in
connection with such assignment, and the payment by the Eligible Transferee of
the purchase price agreed to by Lender and such Eligible Transferee, such
Eligible Transferee shall be a party to this Agreement and shall have all of the
rights and obligations of Lender hereunder (and under any and all other Loan
Documents) to the extent that such rights and obligations have been assigned by
Lender pursuant to the assignment documentation between Lender and such Eligible
Transferee, and Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder and
thereunder to a corresponding extent.  Lender may furnish any information
concerning Borrower or any Guarantor in its possession from time to time to
prospective Eligible Transferees, provided that Lender shall require any

                                       -65-

<PAGE>

such prospective Eligible Transferees to agree in writing to maintain the
confidentiality of such information, except as required by applicable laws or
governmental authorities.

    Section 10.5 Costs, Expenses, and Taxes; Indemnification.

        (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and
expenses in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, filing,
recording, and administration of any of the Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the
Lender with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Lender as to their
rights and responsibilities under any of the Loan Documents including without
limitation, ongoing advice following the effectiveness of this Agreement and all
costs and expenses, if any, in connection with the protection, collection and/or
other enforcement of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  In
addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all stamp and other taxes and fees
payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution, delivery,
filing, and recording of any of the Loan Documents and the other documents to be
delivered under any of the Loan Documents, and agrees to hold and save the
Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay in paying or failure to pay such taxes and fees.

        (b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Lender, any other holder of the
Notes and each of the present and future shareholders, partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents, counsel and successors and assigns of each of them
(collectively with the Lender the "Lender Parties") from and against any and all
loss, cost, expense, claim, liability (including strict liability) or asserted
liability incurred from or out of the Loans, the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement, or any of the documents or instruments to be
executed and delivered hereunder, or otherwise arising out of the
debtor/creditor relationship between them, the Lender or the other Lender
Parties relating to the Loans, the exercise of any of the Lender's rights under
the Loan Documents, any litigation or proceeding instituted or conducted by any
Governmental Authority, any act or omission of the Borrower or otherwise, except
to the extent (and only to the extent) that the same arises from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender.

        (c) Without limiting the generality of the preceding subparagraph (b),
the Borrower agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Lender
Parties from and against, and to reimburse the Lender Parties on demand with
respect to, any and all matters of any and every kind or character, known or

any Environmental Laws, the presence, disposal, escape, seepage, leakage,

        (d) The obligations of the Borrower described in this Section 10.5 shall
survive the closing of the transactions described in this Agreement, including
the making of any and all Loans and the payment and satisfaction of the Notes.

     Section 10.6 Right of Setoff.  The Borrower hereby grants to the Lender a
continuing lien, security interest and right of setoff as security for all of
its Obligations and other liabilities to the Lender, whether now existing or
hereafter arising, upon and against all its deposits, credits, collateral and
property, except real property, now or hereafter in the possession, custody,
safekeeping or control of the Lender or any entity under the control of the
Lender and its successors and assigns or in transit to any of them.  The Lender
may, at any time after the occurrence of a Default, without demand or notice
(any such demand or notice being expressly waived by Borrower), set off the same
or any part thereof and apply the same to any Obligation or liability of
Borrower to the Lender, even though unmatured, irrespective of whether or not
the Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing such
Obligations and liabilities.  ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE THE LENDER TO
MARSHAL OR OTHERWISE EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER
COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES ANY OR ALL OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES PRIOR TO
EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER
PROPERTY OF BORROWER ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY OR IRREVOCABLY WAIVED.
The rights of the Lender under this Section 10.6 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which the
Lender may have.  The Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any
such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

    Section 10.7 Cross-Collateralization.  All Collateral which the Lender may
at any time acquire from the Borrower or Guarantors or from any other source in
connection with the Obligations arising under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall constitute Collateral for each and every Obligation, without
apportionment or designation as to particular Obligations.  All Obligations,
however and whenever incurred shall be secured by all of the Collateral, however
and whenever acquired.  The Lender shall have the right in its sole discretion
to determine the order in which the Lender's rights in or remedies against any
Collateral are to be exercised and which type of Collateral or which portions of
Collateral are to be proceeding against and the order of application of proceeds
of Collateral as against particular Obligations.

    Section 10.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

        (a) This Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of
Connecticut without regard to its conflict of laws rules.

        (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any
Connecticut State or United States Federal court sitting in Connecticut over any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or
the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
such Connecticut State or Federal court.  The

                                       -67-

<PAGE>

Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such
action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to the Borrower at
its address specified in Section 10.2.  The Borrower agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.  The Borrower further waives any objection to venue in such
state and any objection to an action or proceeding in such State on the basis of
forum non conveniens.  The Borrower further agrees that any action or proceeding
brought against the Lender shall be brought only in Connecticut State or United
States Federal courts sitting in Connecticut.

        (c) Nothing in this Section 10.8 shall affect the right of the Lender to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of
the Lender to bring any action or proceeding against the Borrower or its
property in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

        (d) To the extent that the Borrower has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether from
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such Person
hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents.

        (e) THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE TRANSACTIONS ARE
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND IT HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO NOTICE AND HEARING AS
MAY BE ALLOWED UNDER CHAPTER 903a OF THE CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUTES, AS
AMENDED, OR AS OTHERWISE ALLOWED BY ANY STATE OF FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO ANY
PREJUDGMENT REMEDY AND PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER, PROVIDED THE
COMPLAINT SETS FORTH A COPY OF THE WAIVER AND WAIVES ANY CLAIM IN TORT, CONTRACT
OR OTHERWISE AGAINST LENDER'S ATTORNEYS WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF SUCH ISSUANCE OF
A WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER.  FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT
ALLOWED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES DEMAND, PRESENTMENT FOR
PAYMENT, PROTEST, NOTICE OF PROTEST, NOTICE OF DISHONOR, DILIGENCE IN
COLLECTION, NOTICE OF NONPAYMENT OF ANY NOTE AND ANY AND ALL NOTICES OF A LIKE
NATURE.  THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT MAKES THIS WAIVER KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT DURESS, AND ONLY AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSIDERATION OF THE
RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER WITH ITS ATTORNEYS.

    Section 10.9 Entire Agreement; Severability of Provisions.

        (a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents collectively constitute
the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersede any and all
contemporaneous and prior agreements, representations, arrangements and
understandings (written or oral, express or implied) relating to the subject
matter hereof.

        (b) If any term or provision of any of the Loan Documents or the
application thereof to any circumstance shall, in any jurisdiction and to any
extent, be invalid or

                                       -68-

<PAGE>

unenforceable, such term or provision shall be ineffective as to such
jurisdiction only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
thereof or the application of such term or provision to circumstances other than
those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable.

     Section 10.10 Estoppel Certificates.  Within fifteen (15) days after the
Lender requests the Borrower to do so, the Borrower shall cause its chief
financial officer to duly execute and deliver to the Lender a statement
certifying (a) that this Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents to
which the Borrower is a party are in full force and effect and have not been
modified except as described in said statement, (b) the date to which interest
on the Notes has been paid, (c) the unpaid principal balance of the Notes, (d)
whether to the Borrower's knowledge a Default or an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and if so, describing in reasonable detail each such
Default or such Event of Default of which it has knowledge, (e) whether to its
knowledge the Borrower has any defense, setoff, or counterclaim to the payment
or performance of any of its obligations in accordance with the respective terms
of this Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents, as the case may be,
and, if so, describing each defense, setoff, or counterclaim of which it has
knowledge in reasonable detail (including where applicable the amount thereof),
and (f) as to any other matter reasonably requested by the Lender.

    Section 10.11 Waiver of Jury Trial and Consequential Damages.

        (a) THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER EACH HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION (1) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT,
DOCUMENT, OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR (2) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT,
DOCUMENT, OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND
THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY, AND THE LENDER MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION
10.11 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH OF THEM TO THE
WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER EACH
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT MAKES THIS WAIVER KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT
DURESS, AND ONLY AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSIDERATION OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS ATTORNEYS.

        (b) NONE OF THE LENDER, BORROWER, OR ANY AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF EITHER OF
THEM SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY OF THE OTHERS FOR PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING FROM ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHER WRONG RELATING TO THE

<PAGE>

ADMINISTRATION, OR COLLECTION OF THE OBLIGATIONS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE ACTION OR
INACTION OF ANY OF SUCH PERSONS UNDER ANY ONE OR MORE HEREOF OR THEREOF.

        (c) IN THE EVENT THE LENDER SEEKS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ANY OR ALL OF
THE COLLATERAL BY COURT PROCESS OR OTHER METHOD AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAW,
BORROWER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY BOND AND ANY SURETY OR SECURITY RELATING THERETO
REQUIRED BY ANY STATUTE, COURT RULE OR OTHERWISE AS AN INCIDENT TO SUCH

BENEFIT OF ALL VALUATION, APPRAISEMENT AND EXEMPTION LAWS.

evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft,
destruction, or mutilation of any Note, and (a) in the case of loss, theft, or
destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory and furnished without cost to
the Borrower (provided, if the holder of such Note is the Lender or a bank,
insurance company, or other institutional lender, its own unsecured agreement of
indemnity shall be satisfactory), or (b) in the case of mutilation, upon
surrender and cancellation thereof, the Borrower will execute and deliver in
lieu thereof a replacement Note of like tenor.

    Section 10.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All
representations, warranties, and covenants made by the Borrower in this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or other
writing delivered by it or on its behalf thereunder shall be considered to have

writing shall constitute representations and warranties of the Borrower
hereunder.

    Section 10.14 Further Assurances.  The Borrower from time to time shall

such additional information as the Lender may reasonably require to carry out
the terms of this Agreement and to keep the Lender informed of the status and
affairs of the Borrower.

    Section 10.18 Maximum Rate of Interest.  All agreements between the Borrower
and the Lender are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event
whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration or maturity of the indebtedness
evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the
Lender for the use or the forbearance of the indebtedness under the Loan
Documents exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law.  As used herein,
the term "applicable law" shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof
provided, however that in the event there is a change in the law which results
in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Agreement and the Notes
shall be governed by such new law as of its effective date.  In this regard, it
is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Borrower and the Lender in the
execution, delivery and acceptance of this Agreement and the Notes to contract
in strict compliance with the laws of the State of Connecticut from time to time
in effect.  If, under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any
provision hereof or of any of the Loan Documents at the time of performance of
such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of such
validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall
automatically be reduced to the limits of such validity, and if under or from
circumstances whatsoever the Lender should ever receive as interest an amount
which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive
interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced
hereby and not to the payment of interest.  This provision shall control every
other provision of all agreements between the Borrower and the Lender.

    Section 10.19 Domicile of Loans.  Lender may transfer and carry its Loans
at, to or for the account of any office, subsidiary or affiliate of the Lender.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that a
transfer of Loans pursuant to this Section 10.19 would, at the time of such
transfer, result in increased costs under Section 2.10 or 2.11 from those being
charged by the Lender prior to such transfer, then the Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay such increased costs (although the Borrower shall be obligated
to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from
changes after the date of the respective transfer).

    Section 10.20 Confidentiality.

        (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of this Section 10.20,
Lender agrees that it will use its reasonable efforts not to disclose without
the prior consent of the Borrower (other than to its affiliates, employees,
auditors, advisors or counsel if the Lender or the Lender's holding or parent
company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access
to such information, provided such Persons shall be directed to keep such
information confidential as provided in this Section 10.20) any information with
respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which is now or in the future
furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document which information is, at the time of
its disclosure, confidential and/or proprietary and clearly identified as such
in writing, provided, that the Lender may disclose any such information (i) as
has become generally available to the public other than by virtue of a breach of
this Section 10.20(a) by the Lender, (ii) as may be required or appropriate in
any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or Federal
regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over the Lender or to
the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or its
successors, (iii) as may be required or appropriate in respect of any summons or
subpoena or in

                                       -71-

<PAGE>

connection with any litigation, (iv) in order to comply with any law, order,
regulation or ruling applicable to the Lender, (v) to any direct or indirect
contractual counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar agreement (or to any such
contractual counterparty's professional advisor), so long as such contractual
counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by the provisions
of this Section 10.20 and (vi) to any prospective or actual transferee or
participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or participation of any
of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by the Lender, provided that
such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions
contained in this Section 10.20.

        (b) The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Lender may
share with any of its affiliates, and such affiliates may share with the Lender,
any information related to the Borrower or the Guarantors (including, without
limitation, any non-public customer information regarding the creditworthiness
of the Borrower and the Guarantors), provided, such Persons shall be subject to
the provisions of this Section 10.20 to the same extent as the Lender.

    Section 10.21 Amendment and Restatement.  This Agreement amends, restates
and supercedes in its entirety the Existing LSA and said Existing LSA shall be
of no further force and effect.
