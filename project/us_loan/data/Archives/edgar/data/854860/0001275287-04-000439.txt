             WILLIAMS CONTROLS REPORTS FISCAL YEAR END 2004 RESULTS

    PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Williams Controls, Inc.
(the "Company") (OTC: WMCO) today announced its results for the fourth quarter
and full year ended September 30, 2004.

    Net sales for the quarter of $15,908,000 were 14.6% higher than the net
sales of $13,886,000 recorded for the corresponding quarter last year.  Net
sales for the year ended September 30, 2004 increased $6,748,000, or 13.2%, to
$58,050,000 from $51,302,000 for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.

    The Company reported a net loss of $9,754,000, or ($0.42) per diluted
share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to a net loss of
$908,000, or ($0.05) per diluted share for the corresponding quarter in 2003.
For the year ended September 30, 2004, net loss allocable to common
shareholders was $6,030,000, or ($0.28) per diluted share, compared to a net
loss allocable to common shareholders of $1,075,000, or ($0.05) per diluted
share, for the year ended September 30, 2003.  Included in the fiscal 2004
fourth quarter and full year results are a charge of $19,770,000 for loss on
extinguishment of debt related to the elimination of all outstanding Series B
preferred stock and accrued dividends and an income tax benefit of $7,293,000
relating to reversal of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax
assets.

    On September 30, 2004 the Company completed a capital restructuring, which
resulted in the redemption of 98,114 shares of Series B preferred stock for
$26,436,000; the conversion of the remaining 55,436 shares of Series B
preferred stock into 11,761,495 shares of common stock; and the conversion of
the 77,550 of Series A-1 preferred stock into 11,848,740 shares of common
stock.

    The fourth quarter sales increase was driven by higher unit sales volumes
for heavy truck and transit busses.  Sales from these product lines increased
$3,323,000, or 26.4%. This increase was partially offset by reduced sales of
$1,301,000 due to the sale of the passenger car and light truck product lines
on September 30, 2003.

    Operating income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2004
improved to $2,885,000, compared to $39,000 for the same quarter of 2003.
Elimination of the negative gross margins from the passenger car and light
truck product lines and higher truck sales volumes were the primary factors
creating the improvement.  Overall, research and development, selling and
administration expenses were lower in the 2004 fourth quarter due to the sale
of the passenger car and light truck product lines; however the same costs for
heavy truck and transit bus were $266,000 higher primarily due to increased
product and customer development efforts and the recording of a $700,000
environmental accrual related to the Company's Portland, Oregon facility.

    Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2004 increased due to higher
unit sales volumes for the heavy truck and transit bus product lines.  Sales
for these product lines increased $11,356,000, or 24.3%, compared to the same
period in fiscal 2003.  This increase was partially offset by the absence of
$4,608,000 of sales related to the passenger car and light truck product
lines.

    Operating income from continuing operations for the year ended September
30, 2004 improved to $9,718,000, compared to $1,786,000 for the prior year.
Gross margins improved to $18,816,000 in fiscal 2004 due to elimination of the
negative gross margins from the passenger car and light truck product lines,
higher heavy truck sales volumes and lower warranty expense.  Fiscal 2003
operating income included a gain of $951,000 related to a settlement with a
former passenger car and light truck customer.  Research and development,
selling and administration expenses for the full year 2004 were higher for
heavy truck and transit bus primarily due to increased product and customer
development efforts and the recording of a $950,000 environmental accrual
related to the Company's Portland, Oregon facility; however, overall these
expenses were lower than the comparable period in fiscal 2003 due to the sale
of the passenger car and light truck product lines.

    Williams Controls' Chief Executive Officer, Patrick W. Cavanagh stated,
"excluding the costs of the recapitalization completed on September 30, 2004,
we had positive earnings for the fourth quarter."  He continued, "our core
heavy truck markets continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter, following a
pattern established earlier in the year.  This market recovery, combined with
the sale at the end of fiscal 2003 of our passenger car and light truck
product lines, have been the primary factors driving our earnings growth."  He
concluded "our earnings improvement, combined with the completion of our
recapitalization, positions the Company well to take advantages of future
growth opportunities."
