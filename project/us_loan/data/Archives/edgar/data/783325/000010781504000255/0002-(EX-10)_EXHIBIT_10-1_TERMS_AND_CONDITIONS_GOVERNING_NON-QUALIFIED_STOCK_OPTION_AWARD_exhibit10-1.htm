<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option shall become immediately exercisable upon the occurrence of any of the following events (the "Special Vesting Events"):</P>
<P>(i)&#9;the termination of the Employee's employment with the Company or a subsidiary by reason of Retirement, Disability or death, or</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company while the Employee is employed by the Company or a subsidiary.</P>
<P>Any unvested shares are immediately forfeited upon the Employee's cessation of employment with the Company or a subsidiary prior to the occurrence of a Special Vesting Event.  However, the Committee may, in its discretion, vest options upon separation.</P>
<B><U><LI>TERM OF OPTION</LI>
</B></U><P>All rights to exercise this option shall terminate on the Expiration Date which is the earliest of the following dates:</P>
<P>(i)&#9;three months after the Employee's termination of employment with the Company or a subsidiary prior to the occurrence of a Special Vesting Event,</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;ten years from the date of grant after the Employee's termination of employment with the Company or a subsidiary on or after the occurrence of a Special Vesting Event, or</P>
<P>(iii)&#9;ten years from the date of grant.</P>
<B><U><LI>METHOD OF EXERCISE</LI>
</B></U><P>This option may be exercised only by appropriate notice in writing delivered to the Corporate Secretary of the Company and accompanied by:</P>
<P>(i)&#9;a check payable to the order of the Company for the full purchase price of the shares purchased, or delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Employee and acceptable to the Committee (or an attestation of the Employee's ownership of such shares in lieu of delivery) valued at fair market value on the date of exercise, or some combination of a check and use of such shares (and shares acquired in a prior option exercise may not be used for this purpose until the shares have been held by the Employee for six months), and</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;such other documents or representations (and satisfaction of any applicable tax withholding obligations) as the Company may reasonably request in order to comply with securities, tax or other laws then applicable to the exercise of the option.</P>
<B><U><LI>NON-TRANSFERABILITY; DEATH; DESIGNATED BENEFICIARY</LI>
</B></U><P>This option is not transferable by the Employee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except for transfers to family members and family partnerships.  This option is exercisable during the Employee's lifetime only by the Employee. </P>
<P>If the Employee dies after termination of employment without any Special Vesting Event having occurred but during the option period and before the Expiration Date specified in paragraph 4 hereof, this option may be exercised, to the extent otherwise vested, in the manner described in paragraph 5 hereof, by the Employee's "Designated Beneficiary" (defined below) or if none or if the Designated Beneficiary does not survive the Employee, by the Employee's estate or the person to whom the option passes by will or the laws of descent and distribution, but only within a period of:</P>
<P>(a)&#9;two years after the Employee's death, or </P>
<P>(b)&#9;ten years from the date of grant, whichever period is shorter.</P>
<P>To the extent that this option may be exercisable after the death of the Employee (whether before or after termination of employment), this option may be exercised by the "Designated Beneficiary" of the Employee.  The "Designated Beneficiary" shall be the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Employee in a writing filed with the Committee in such form and at such time as the Committee may require.  In the absence of a living Designated Beneficiary, any rights or benefits that would have been exercisable by or distributable to the Employee shall be exercised by or distributed to the legal representative of Employee's estate or the person to whom the option passes by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  If a Designated Beneficiary who has survived the Employee dies before exercise of all rights option or before complete distribution of benefits under this option, then any rights that would have been exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary shall be exercised by the legal representativ
e of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary, and any benefits distributable to the Designated Beneficiary shall be distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary.</P>
<B><U><LI>REGISTRATION</LI>
</B></U><P>If at any time during the option period the Company shall be advised by its counsel that shares deliverable upon exercise of the option are required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") or any state securities laws, or that delivery of the shares must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus meeting the requirements of that Act or such state securities laws, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the registration or provide the prospectus not later than a reasonable time following each exercise of this option, but delivery of shares by the Company may be deferred until the registration is effected or the prospectus is available.  The Employee shall have no interest in shares covered by this option until certificates for the shares are issued, or in lieu of certificates, shares are credited to the Employee's account in the book-entry form.</P>
<B><U><LI>ADJUSTMENTS</LI>
</B></U><P>If the Company shall at any time change the number of shares of its Common Stock without new consideration to the Company (such as by stock dividend, stock split or similar transaction), the total number of shares then remaining subject to purchase hereunder shall be changed in proportion to the change in issued shares and the option price per share shall be adjusted so that the total consideration payable to the Company upon the purchase of all shares not theretofore purchased shall not be changed.  If during the term of this option, the Common Stock of the Company shall be changed into another kind of stock or into securities of another corporation, cash, evidence of indebtedness, other property or any combination thereof (the "Acquisition Consideration"), whether as a result of reorganization, sale, merger, consolidation, or other similar transaction, the Committee shall cause adequate provision to be made whereby the Employee shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the due exercise of thi
s option the Acquisition Consideration the Employee would have been entitled to receive for Common Stock acquired through exercise of this option immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.</P>
<B><U><LI>WITHHOLDING</LI>
</B></U><P>Employee may satisfy any tax withholding obligations arising with respect to the exercise of this option in whole or in part by tendering a check to the Company for any required amount, by election to have a portion of the shares that would otherwise be issued withheld to defray all or a portion of any applicable taxes, or by election to have the Company or its subsidiaries withhold the required amounts from other compensation payable to the Employee.</P>
<B><U><LI>IMPACT ON OTHER BENEFITS</LI>
</B></U><P>The income attributable to the exercise of this option shall not be includable as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other benefit plan or program offered by the Company or its subsidiaries.</P>
<B><U><LI>PLAN GOVERNS</LI></OL>

</B></U><P>Notwithstanding anything in this option, the terms of this option shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, a copy of which may be obtained by the Employee from the Secretary of the Company, and this option is subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations established by the Committee from time to time pursuant to the Plan.</P>
