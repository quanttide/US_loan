                                                                     -----------

                    FIRST: The name of the corporation is Sovereign Specialty

                    SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation is to be

name of its registered agent at that address is The Corporation Trust Company.

                    THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any
lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of Delaware.

                    FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the
Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock and the par
value of each of such shares is $0.01.

                    FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the
management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation, and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers
of the Corporation and of its directors and stockholders:

                    (1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such
as from time to time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the
by-laws. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so
provide.
                    (2) The Board of Directors shall have powers without the
assent or vote of the stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or
repeal the by-laws of the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved
for any proper purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and
liens upon all or any part of the property of the Corporation; to determine the
use and disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the
declaration and payment of dividends.

                    (3) The directors in their discretion may submit any
contract or act for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the
stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of
considering any such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be
approved or be ratified by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of
the Corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and
entitled to vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there
represented in person or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the
Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or
ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or
act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors' interest, or
for any other reason.

                    (4) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore
or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered
to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised
or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the
statutes of Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time
made by the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall
invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such
by-law had not been made.

                  SIXTH: Each person who is or was or had agreed to become a
director or officer of the Corporation, or each such person who is or was
serving or who had agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a
director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (including the heirs, executor, administrators or estate of
such person), shall be indemnified by the Corporation, in accordance with the
by-laws of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, if permitted by applicable law, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) or any other applicable laws as
presently or hereafter are in effect. The Corporation may, by action of the
Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation, and to persons serving as employees or agents of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, at the
request of the Corporation, with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers. The Corporation shall be required to
indemnify any person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or
part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors or is a proceeding to enforce such
person's claim to indemnification pursuant to the rights granted by this
Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise by the Corporation. Without limiting
the generality of the effect of the foregoing, the Corporation may enter into
one or more agreements with any person which provide for indemnification greater
or different than that provided in this sixth paragraph. Any amendment or repeal
of this sixth paragraph shall not adversely affect any right or protection
existing hereunder in respect of any actor omission occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal.

                  SEVENTH: A director of the Corporation shall not be personally
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the
director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts
or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (3) under section 174 of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, or (4) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. Any amendment or repeal of this seventh
paragraph shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.

                  EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed
between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between
the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of
equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, may, on the application in
a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on
the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under
the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed
for the Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8 of the
Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of
the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may
be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in
number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on the Corporation.

                    NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter,
change or repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in
the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers
conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this
reserved power, provided, however, that any amendment or repeal of the seventh
or eighth paragraphs of this Certificate of Incorporation shall not adversely
affect any right or protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
