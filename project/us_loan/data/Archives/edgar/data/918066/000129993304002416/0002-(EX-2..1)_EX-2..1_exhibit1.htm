and the Surveys are referred to herein collectively as the &#147;<B>Title Documents</B>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">3.3. <U>Title Review and Cure</U>. During the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser shall review

be removed any liens and security interests including, without limitation, mechanics and

by or through Seller after the Effective Date. If Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement
before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U>, then Purchaser
shall have been deemed to have approved any title exception set forth in the Title Documents that
Seller is not obligated to remove and did not agree in writing to remove or cure. If after the

In such case, the Closing Date shall be extended for up to ten (10)&nbsp;days in order for Purchaser
and Seller to determine if such exception can be resolved and to give Purchaser the opportunity to

reasonably require during the Due Diligence Period based on its review of the Title Commitments and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.4. <U>Expenses</U>. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each party hereto shall
pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder,
including all legal and accounting fees and disbursements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.5. <U>Invalidity and Waiver</U>. If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or
inoperative, then so far as is reasonable and possible the remainder of this Agreement shall be
deemed valid and operative, and, to the greatest extent legally possible, effect shall be given to
the intent manifested by the portion held invalid or inoperative. The failure by either party to
enforce against the other any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of such party&#146;s right to enforce against the other party the same or any other such term or
provision in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.6. <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement shall, in all respects, be governed, construed,
applied, and enforced in accordance with the law of the state of Maryland.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.7. <U>Survival</U>. Subject to Section&nbsp;8.3, the provisions of this Agreement and the
obligations of the parties not fully performed at the Closing shall survive the Closing and shall
not be deemed to be merged into or waived by the instruments of Closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.8. <U>No Third Party Beneficiary</U>. This Agreement is not intended to give or confer any
benefits, rights, privileges, claims, actions, or remedies to any person or entity as a third party
beneficiary, decree, or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.9. <U>Entirety and Amendments</U>. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement between
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the Properties.
This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only in writing by a non-electronic instrument
executed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. For the avoidance of doubt, copies of
signed instruments that are electronically transmitted constitute a writing for this purpose.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.10. <U>Time of the Essence</U>. Time is of the essence in the performance of this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.11. <U>Time</U>. All times, whenever specified herein, shall be local time in San Diego,
California.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.12. <U>Press Release</U>. Until the Closing, neither Seller nor Purchaser will release or
cause or permit to be released any press notices, or publicity (oral or written) or advertising
promotion relating to, or otherwise announce or disclose or cause or permit to be announced or
disclosed, in any manner whatsoever, the terms, conditions or substance of this Agreement without
first obtaining the written consent of the other party except those disclosures that are required
by securities law(s), including the Securities Act of 1933, or contractual obligation (in which
case notice shall be timely provided to the other party of such requirement and disclosure). The
foregoing shall not preclude either party from discussing the substance or any relevant details of
such transactions with any of its attorneys, accountants, professional consultants, lenders,
partners, investors, or any prospective lender, partner or investor, as the case may be, or prevent
either party hereto, from complying with laws, rules, regulations and court orders, including
without limitation, governmental regulatory, disclosure, tax and reporting requirements, or from
Seller making disclosures in the ordinary course of its due diligence inspections and contacts with
third parties related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party to this transaction (and
each employee, agent or representative of the foregoing) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to them relating
to such tax treatment and tax structure except to the extent maintaining such confidentiality is
necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws. Except as required by
law or SEC requirements, the authorization in the preceding sentence is not intended to permit
disclosure of any other information unrelated to the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transaction including (without limitation) (a)&nbsp;any portion of the transaction documents or related
materials to the extent not related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction, (b)
the existence or status of any negotiations unrelated to the tax issues, or (c)&nbsp;any other term or
detail not relevant to the tax treatment or the tax structure of the transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.13. <U>Attorneys&#146; Fees</U>. Should either party employ attorneys to enforce any of the
provisions hereof, the non-prevailing party agrees to pay the prevailing party all reasonable
costs, charges, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, expended or incurred by the
prevailing party in connection therewith.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.14. <U>Notices</U>. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be served on the parties at the addresses set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;I</U>. Any such notices
shall be either (a)&nbsp;sent by overnight delivery using a nationally recognized overnight courier, in
which case notice shall be deemed delivered one Business Day after deposit with such courier, (b)
sent by facsimile, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered upon transmission of such notice
with confirmed receipt by the sender&#146;s machine, or (c)&nbsp;sent by personal delivery, in which case
notice shall be deemed delivered upon receipt or refusal of delivery. A party&#146;s address may be
changed by written notice to the other party; provided, however, that no notice of a change of
address shall be effective until actual receipt of such notice. Copies of notices are for
informational purposes only, and a failure to give or receive copies of any notice shall not be
deemed a failure to give notice. The attorney for a party has the authority to send notices on
behalf of such party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.15. <U>Construction</U>. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their counsel have
reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement or any exhibits or amendments hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.16. <U>Remedies Cumulative</U>. Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this
Agreement, the remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and shall not preclude the
assertion or exercise of any other rights or remedies available by law, in equity or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.17. <U>Calculation of Time Periods</U>. Unless otherwise specified, in computing any
period of time described herein, the day of the act or event after which the designated period of
time begins to run is not to be included and the last day of the period so computed is to be
included, unless such last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for national banks in the
location where the Properties are located, in which event the period shall run until the end of the
next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The last day of any period of time
described herein and the time during any day by which an event must occur shall be deemed to end at
5 p.m.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.18. <U>Public Company Requirements</U>. Upon Purchaser&#146;s request, during the Due Diligence
Period and for a period of two years after Closing, Seller shall make the books and records of the
Properties and the Guilford Real Estate Trust available to Purchaser for inspection, copying and
audit by Purchaser&#146;s designated accountants, and at Purchaser&#146;s expense. Seller shall provide
Purchaser, but without third-party expense to Seller, with copies of, or access to, such factual
information as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, and in the possession or control of
Seller, to enable Purchaser to comply with applicable filing requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (&#147;<B>SEC</B>&#148;). Purchaser or its designated independent or other accountants may
audit the operating statements of the Properties and the Guilford Real Estate Trust, and Seller
shall supply such documentation in its possession or control as Purchaser or its accountants may
reasonably request in order to complete such audit and shall provide to Purchaser&#146;s auditors a
customary representation letter from Seller or its representative reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser&#146;s auditors in connection with such audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.19. <U>Execution in Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of such counterparts shall
constitute one Agreement. To facilitate execution of this Agreement, the parties may execute and
exchange by telephone facsimile counterparts of the signature pages.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.20. <U>Further Assurances</U>. In addition to the acts and deeds recited herein and
contemplated to be performed, executed or delivered by either party at Closing, each party agrees
to perform, execute and deliver, for a period of two (2)&nbsp;years following the Closing Date, any
further actions, documents, and will obtain such consents, as may be reasonably necessary or as may
be reasonably requested to fully effectuate the purposes, terms and conditions of this Agreement or
to further perfect the conveyance, transfer and assignment of the Subject Rights to Purchaser.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.21. <U>Waiver of Jury Trial</U>. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.22. <U>Submission to Jurisdiction</U>. Each party hereby submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Maryland State Courts and the federal courts sitting in the State of Maryland
for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
